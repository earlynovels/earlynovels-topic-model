Harriet appears Such a dh\(m2\ vacuum. 
I was last night at carlisle house,.. where my brother, to oblige whom I went thither, introduced me to Lady Anne Clifford, who is lately arrived from Italy with her aunt Lady Harman. — — This young lady values herself prodigiously upon a large fortune, which has devolved to her in consequence of the death of a brother and Sister, and I believe Charles values her upon the Same account. Should an alliance take place between the two families, the one fond of riches and the other of honours, I tremble for what may be the event in Some future day. 
You will expect possibly to hear my opinion of the entertainments of the place — Tired to death with impertinence from apes of quality, and affronted by borrowed wittieisms from females who have Sunk themselves below their Sex, and are yet permitted with those who rank themselves with the highest of mortals. It is impossible to describe the fatigues of the evening. Surfeited with flattery from Miss Clifford, I returned distra<ffed with the headache. This is deemed pleasure by Some : but, alas! one hour of your company, in your

harriet’s opinion, is worth an age of Such trifling. Mrs. Vareny kindly called on me this morning. Her friendly Society alone could have restored ray complacency, absent as I was from my Lucy, and Sick gf polite persecution. This generous lady came to Solicit a benefaction from my mother for a distrefled widow: and you may be Sure, Such an example being Set, her ladysliip could not well with hold her benevolence — and Mrs.' Vareny Succeeded. Can an hundred masquerades convey So much real Satisfaction to the heart, as onenuch humane 
action.?

; The last packet brought us a letter from Lord Mulcester. He makes ho nourable mention of you : indeed George esteems you much: he alwa}s calls you Sister; and it is a moot point with me whether he loves Harriet or Lucy best; 
I mean, in the Sisterly way: for his disappointment in his first love (which miss grandison callsfirji nonfmfe') hangs heavy on his heart, good youth! Allow for a sister’s partiality, Harriet! he is almost a Second Sir Charles, even as Mr. Richard' Soil has drawn him, only approaching a little nearer to human nature.

What an unfeasonable fit of the gout has Mr. Villars! I wish it had not happened till after the birthday, and then Lucy could have attended you at rose Mount: but our good folks are so fond of parade — there is. also another reason in their wise heads I shall in due time acquaint you with their political scheme— — alas!

■ Yes, my dear, my father has Swerved from the Sentiments of his forefathers for a paltry consideration, and would, if it were polsible, without consuiting her inclination, dispose of his daughter on the same occasion: but the independence my aunt Northington (foreseeing events) has kindly Settled on me, prevents that misfortune.

Hiding out for an airing the other morning, attended only by Thomas, I let my horse take his course;; after three hours gentle pace, he brought me to a pleasant village, where on the verge of a common, 1 found a decent cottage, or rather box, adorned with an air of Simple elegance. In the little court before the door all the hardy winter exotics were placed in painted vases; the window curtains, I perceived, were crimson damask; and a guittar was hanging in one of the rooms. Struck with Such an uncommon appearance in an cbfciue village, I wislitd to see and know farther: I therefore ordered Thomas to beg a. glass of water for me. A very decent old woman came to the door, and desired to know “if madam would alight, and 
“have 
( II) 
have aglass of her own distilled water."’, I readily complied; and, after tasting the old lady’s cordial, was complimented with a Sight of her house. The drelsing roomi was hung with India paper, and furnislied with the most elegant cabinets, dressing, equipage, c. In another apartment was < a forte piano,. music books, new novels, ', playsj operas, cc. What most attracted my notice were a pair of globes and Some 
maps, which were kept in a room Sacred; 
for. the old lady told me Ihedid not know

I H A V E not Succeeded, Lucy, in my attempt to find out the fair incognita. I have Seen her, it is true; but it was only a transient view. The first opportunity that offered I renewed my visit to her retreat. When 1 arrived, I found her playing on her guittar, accompanying it with a voice So melodious, that I was for a few moments lost in admiration. But 1 ought first to have told you, I left 
, Thomas and the horses at a distance, and consequently was not perceived by her at my entrance. My good old hostess received me very cordially, but told me “she believed madam would be displeased ‘‘ to See a stranger.” Contrary, however, to my usual timidity, the lady’s maid coming downstairs, I Sent my respecls to her mistress, and begged (if my request were not too improper) to be adhiitted to Speak with her. She immediately came down, and conducted me to her drefiing room. I then apologised for the intrusion,

It is Scarcely possible to describe the sweet ness of her manner, whilst addressing me:, but when she had done Speaking, she turned, to the window, and put her handkerchief to her eyes — fine eyes indeed she has, but a kind of a wildness in them that Seems to indicate a disordered mind — 
. ^ perhaps that is the case,, and this romantic retreat is the effect of her raised imai gination. 1 took, my leave, plea fed, but not Satisfied : to intrude farther would be indeed to gratify my own curiosity (which is perhaps impertinent) at the expense of another’s peace.

Here I am, Sir James, with Peregrine and two or three niore Such honest fellows. My business, you will suppose, is Shooting; indeed it is not; I have nobler game in view. But first let me premise, Peregrine Villars has a Sister (as I suppose you have heard) ycleped 
Harriet -- Now this Same Harriet is 
deemed a nonpareil both in person and in mind, and certainly she is So : as to 
C the 
( 24) 
the former, I care not a rusli for it, except for a novelty; as to the latter she is pious, modest, a great oeconomist, fond of home, ' and, in short, has every accomplislmient one could wish for in a 
wife or slster. Now the fates have decreed 
^ \ 
_ 4 
that I must marry, or else our paternal estate must descend to the b.’s, than which 1 had rather go to the galleys; — (an apt Simile, you will Say, when I am Speaking of marriage.) — Now Lord east main has chosen this fair lady for his future niece, and that' is my errand here; although I have not mentioned one word of it either to Mr. Villars, Peregrine, or any one: for I must observe a little, and be very wary in my conduci; for she Seems mistress of a great deal of penetration, and I would not fubject rnyfelf to a refusal from the little minx. Fortune with her I do not expect; for 1 believe old villars’s affairs are a little embar railed: but he has interest enough to procure me an Ir’.ih peerage; and I believe. What with family connexions and the girss good qualities, this is as tolerable a match as I ought to expeci. You know my name h up \ therefore Some ceremony is required in addressing Such a piece of purity ai this. What must I dp? Why,

faith, I must take up a few virtues on trust, display them with klaty introduce them a propos., and my business is done. Do you approve of this Sober Scheme, or not? Remember the Eastmain estate depends on it. — — But what is to be done with Isabella? Haughty and violent as she is, and notwithstanding her elopeistent, 
I know, when any pecuniary matter is wanting, she will be with me again, and then the first feduciion^will come rattling in my ears. I am sensible that Charles Temple is fond of her, and (he perchance of him. I wish I could catch her tripping, or find out her retreat; I could then have a good pretext for breaking with her, which otherwise I shall be puzzled to bring about; for the manner in which she would tell her story to the unsuspecling Harriet would Spoil the de sign at once. Help me out, Sir James, • or I am lost; for 1 know twenty thousand at least shall I command, if this alliance takes place; for Lord Eastmain will grudge no expense on the occasion, So much is he wrapped up in Harriet Villars. All these premilses considered, you will own, is a Sufficient excuse for the conduct of 
John Melmoth.

Charles was, in the true fense of the word, as fine as a Lord, miss Clifford had Scraped all her relations together from the fourth generation to welcome her intended spouse and sister in law; and they were So be dreffed, and So be dizened, and did So stare at my brilliant ladysliip, who flaunted away in jonquil and Silver, and a most elegant Suit of Brustels point, just arrived from Lord Mulcester, that I was, to be Sure, rather a figure to be envied: (No vanity at all in me, Harriet!) Two or three old grimalkins of quality next made their appearance,; and the card tables were just Set, when Lord B. was announced. He came in with an air So degage, and yet So little of a fop, and paid his compliments with Such a manly grace, that in Spite of ray averslon to his moral cjbaracler, I could not See him with that detestation which every honest girl ought to have for a libertine. He Soon Singled me out; hoped I was entertained at the Lock; he intended to have a Seat there himself, as he found it was the taste. (Only think, Harriet, the taste to go to church!) It puts me in mind of Dean swift’s advising the Duke of Wharton to take the frolic of being good. And So we are to change our mode in .worship 
C a as

as vie do our caps; and this in the reign of a pious Prince and his amiable consort, who endeavour to Set the best example. 
When this discourse was ended, Lord B. with a delicacy I did not think him capable of, made me an offer of his fine person : I refused him; but with more good nature than I think he deserved, all things considered. He had the assurance to tell me, he Should not yet despair, if by his future conduct he could gain my esteem. 
(A modest hope, you will Say.) He looked with very Significant eyes at Charles and Miss Clifford : fine advocates he will have in them. An excellent creature is this Sime Anne Clifford. I will give you an instance of her humanity: Lord B. was invited by Charles to a morning party; he excused himself by Saying (and I believe with truth) he was engaged to attend at the Levee in behalf of an unfortunate youth who lay under Sentence of death, whose aged mother had been his petitioner. “Could I, Says he, refuse ?” 
-- -- Psliaw! hang the man, Said miss 
“Clifford i it will ease the mother of a “torment, and he will only die a little “while before in the common course of “things it would happen.” * — My look of indignation would have petrified a 
woman

Woman of sensibility. Lord B. bit his lip; and Charles blushed disapprobation. Such a glaring instance of the depravity of human nature could not escape any one : but, after a few moments, the cards and stihes went to work as before. His Lordship took his leave to pursue the good work before mentioned. 
From the account I have now given, you will perceive the Devil is not So black as he is painted. But although I have done this justice to one philanthropic virtue in the man, yet your lucy’s heart will remain untouched by Such exterior qualities.

Sir James Hazzeldine to John:

I approve of your scheme, Jack, in all its branches'. I have heard of, Harriet Villars; and by all accounts she is a nonpareil. As to a wife, : why, it is a mere nominal affair in these days. A man' has no more to' do with a wife thaui he has with a conveyance : the lawyers are the principals f you have only to Sign and Seal,, and ^iefeeive the money. Your honour!will be Safe with Such a girl as miss Velars; and that is all you need to care fbr. You may pursue your Schemes of pleasure as usual; leave your meek,, dutiful confort to mind her bantams and bee hivesand when, you are tired of. variety, except the name of wise makes' her charms pall, you may enjoy a month. agreeably enough at Easlmain'or Rose' Mount with the pious idiot, who will think it her duty to receive you with complacence, and to make all things as comfortable as possible.

I have Seen Lord Eastmain: he chuckled with joy to think you approved his Scheme: for I read your letter to him, if it may be called reading it to reverse every line, and make you a mere moral fellow, and desperately in love with the fair Harriet. I thought his gouty lord stiip would have danced with his crutches. 
Now this is as it Should jbe,. (cried he); 
‘‘ what he Said to me I did not mind; 
but he certainly has wrote his Senti ‘‘ ments to you, who are hjs friend.” — ■ Yes, old square toes, thought I, he certainly has, but not fit for your eye, till Eastmain estate is fettled. 
As to your beautiful bunter Isabella, 
1 can by no means find out her retreat; but patience and perseverance will do all things. 1 hope Ihe is abroad, and wdll stay there till you are (hackled *, and then she may come if Ihe pleases: for girls bred in Miss villars’s manner will think. it their duty to nurse both your mistress and her bastards, if she should chance to have any. And this is the comfort of those (nonsensical) virtuous women, as they choose to call themselves. — Your person, and your Specious manner, when you please, may perhaps attracl the girl, if that Spirited little devil Lucy Temple

You know the friendsliip that suit fists between them, and to what romantic lengths girls carry their friendihips, espe> cially. if opposed; and that old Villars may do, if Lucy Should tamper with Harriet; therefore Secure Lady Lucy and all is Safe. Lord B. is addresling^ this delicate termagant; if he Succeeds in his Suit, then Surely you may in yours.. Charles Temple is already married (in the news papers) to miss Clifford : but I fancy the match is really in great forwardness. Thus will a hundred and twenty thousand pounds be thrown away upon his paper Ikull. But fools have fortune. Why could I not have thought of this, or why could you not have put me in mind of it? An engregious blunder,, ‘jack, have we made between us; for certainly I am (I think. I may without vanity say So) a much cleverer fellow than, he is.

Her early disappointment from Lord G. gave her a strong dislike to nobility; which antipathy increased with years and Solitude. My mother, as you have heard, was her darling. Harriet was So happy as to Succeed to that place in her asteciionsw The good old lady was frequently pointing out to me the rocks and slioals, whereon unexperienced young women are almost continually wrecked. — The Court I was taught to Ihun as an infected place; and mankind in general was Set up as a beacon to me. 1 must acknowledge my aunt was too narrow minded in Some things. The falsehood of a man she had tenderly loved, had Soured her temper, and contracted her ideas; yet Some of her maxims were well grounded. My aunt’s knowledge of the world was indisputable.. I remember once she Said to me, on suspicion that I cast a favourable eye on an officer of horse quartered near her villa, (and indeed it was but Suspicion, for on my honour I never yet beheld man with a preference) “I blame you “not at present, (said Ihe) Harriet; and “only propose to give you Some advice “for your future condua At your age “the heart is fusceptible of the Softest “impreslions, and Nature perhaps did

OUR brother, the friend of mur heart, (a name more sacred than that included in the fraternal tie) congratulates you on your rejection of Lord B. He knew Lucy would not be caught by outward form never once was he deceived in his Sister. — What can I, what must 1 Say of my honoured parents on this occasion?

I do not mean any particular reflection on Lord B. He is certainly blessed with good sense and good nature, and has many to keep him in countenance even in his groflest faults; but a man of Such a cast cannot 
I _ 
be a Suitable husband for Lucy Temple. 
It has been hinted to me, Lucy, that my dear and honoured father is proposed 
as ambaltador to V -- -- -- -- --. Sure he will 
not except Such an arduous talk. Why should he fatigue himself with state affairs, when there are so many younger persons, whose perfect health and strength of faculties render them more fit for Such an office? Did it become me to remonstrate on the occasion, I would,, with all sub miffion, advise his Lordship to decline' an honour, that I am afraid would, if accepted, in Such a climate prejudice his constitution. My uncle Stanly and Charles, 
I doubt, have been the Yecret projectors 
of

t 
( 46 1 
of this Scheme. Charles has no ideas Separate from magnificence; and, in this age of elaborate luxury, all means must be taken to Support the glare of show. Pardon me, Lucy, if I write rather too Severely of Charles; but I have reason to be very much displeased with him. I shall write to him Shortly, as Something has occurred to prevent my paying my duty to my dear father and mother, and visiting my native country, for sometime yet. 
In about a month from this date, a friend, whom I much esteem, proposes to be in London. You mull have heard of Lord Belgrave. His father, the late Lord, without any just, or indeed plausible reason, banislied his amiable Son, allowing him only a trifling annuity — trifling in comparison of his rank; yet he was never heard to murmur or complain. When, about three years Since, the late Earl was attacked by a malignant fever, he then Saw his error, and recalled his faultless Son, who only arrived time enough to take a last farewell. The good, the pious youth, Shocked with his father’s death, at a time when he hoped to have been the Support of his declining years, could not bear the Scene; wherefore, 
having

having given proper orders to his steward, and paid his Sisters (whom I suppose you may have Seen) their fortunes, he returned again to the continent, where Providence threw him in my way, as a blessing that will sweeten, I hope, my future life. He is a wonder, my Lucy. Could I be so happy to call him brother! Bin that is beyond my hope; for, all excellent as my sister is, she is not the person adapted to frederick’s turn of mind: the mild, the timid, the gentle miss Villars would ' rather be an object of his attention. However, guard your heart, Lucy: for, besides his mental accomplishments, he is handsome beyond description — then Such, expressive eyes! his very Soul may be read in them. He has sought all opportunities of improving his mind by study, conversation, and travel. He is not only acquainted with all the Sciences, but withal the professors throughout Europe. In short, he has So well mixed and digested his knowledge of men and books, that. he is at this time one of the most accom plislied persons of the age. — His lord strip will do me the favour to bring with him a congratulatory letter to Charles, and Some presents for his bride : till which.

He told me, as a younger brother he could not maintain me as he wished; that his match (and he voluntarily Swore to it) was a match of interest; and that I should reap the Sweets of it. Afterwards, with tears, menaces, and all together, I made him take me to Carlisle' house, where his Sister and intended spouse were.' — I Saw the tall awkward monster dangling on charles’s arm, drested in a rich fancy dress, and his Sister as a Sultana: she was by far the most elegant figure in the room, (rnyfelf excepted) j but, thank my stars!

I dine today with my new sister! No doing without Lady Lucy, her taste is So elegant! — Mrs. vareny’s name is announced below -- Dear woman !■ I sly to meet her, my Second Harriet. 
She is just gone t the occasion of her kind visit was to beg I would inform, you that Miss Vareny is Seized with the Smallpox; the whole family would otherwise have paid you a visit at rose Mount, and left Miss Vareny with you. till Spring but this unfortunate disorder has prevented what would have been So agreeable to you. 
If you should have occasion to Send to my brother’s wise, you must direct “To “the Honourable Lady Charles Temple.” I thought proper to enforce this caufion, as you and I are apt to be deficient in point of etiquetts. Adieu!

It must net, it cannot be. 1 have reasoned with rnyfelf, as much as 1 am capa ble of reasoning, and cannot comprehend what, can be meant by forcing a young woman, into a marriage, because it is termed honourable and advantageous, when" she wants none of those honours or advantages.

And, besides all this,, in what light am I to be looked on but as an upper Servant having nothing mine (in a proper sense); more than a child has, whose father allows him to call anything his,, though without leave he cannot dispose of the Smallest part.

sway the meaning both of love and marriage, according to the common acceptation of the words; not but I agree with you in Some points, and wish we might all remain in the primitive state of innocence, till the men creatures are brought to a more honourable composition. This is the present language: but whether we Should not alter our Sentiments, were we to be struck by the appearance of Some insinuating wretch of the lordly Sex, and Suffer burr fancies to run away with our judgments? We should then join the multitude, and plead custom for our suh mihion. — A witty author Says, that Love and Death have their fatalities, and strike, home Some time or other. — You Ihake | your wise head, and lay, ‘‘ That may be | the case with Such a tovm bred girl as ’ “Lucy but you are invulnerable — So the fable Says Achilles was — all but his heel.

I suppose I mixed a little acrimony with my Speech; for he bit his lip, and reddened. I wonder how long he will think fit to stay at rose Mount. I am, at present partly a priibner, keeping in my own apartments, except I am Sent to, or Something material obliges me to come down. 
What a Selslfh creature am I grown, Lucy! Self has entirely run away with my pen. I cannot think or write of Lord Mulcester or Lord Belgrave; it will only occasion comparisons that will make my persecutor appear more disagreeable.

Mr, Melmoth, to Sir James Hazzeldine. 
M Y credentials were Sent by the old Peer. Old Villars forwarded the answer immediately; and I, on the strength of it, Set out for rose Mount with a five hundred pound note in my pocket, to Sweeten the fatigues of the journey. 
I really have a kind of penchant for this lovely frost piece; Ihe is certainly very charming. You never Saw her, I think, Hazzeldine; therefore I will describe her to you. She is of the higher middle Size i has a most delicate complexion, blue eyes, and fine brown hair, drelscd in Some degree conformable to the fashion, though Some of the ringlets are. Suffered to wanton at pleasure : then she has the most beautiful hand and arm you ever Saw, and So much dignity in her air and manner, that I cannot help admiring 
her i and yet, when she Speaks, especially 
if it be to an inferior, it is with so much affability, and Ihe Smiles So bewitchingly 
Sweet,

Sweet, she puts me in mind of the old Scotch ballad of Rosline castle.

Do not think, by this description, 
Hazzeldine, that I am in love. -- -- -- -- No— — 
that romantic paltion be ever far from the breast of Jack Melmoth! The Sex was created to answer a temporary purpose. I wish Harriet Villars mine for many reasons: her person will be new, and a delicate person Ihe has; in the next place, if I Should choose to canvas for the county, what an helpmate shall I have! The affability and sweetness before mentioned will be all in all : besides, married to Such a wife, I shall have so many opportunities that a Single man cannot. So that, on the whole, it is resolved Harriet Villars shall be Mrs. Melmoth. 
At present the lady is in her altitudes', I

fate is almost at a crisis: but of this in its proper course. I had but just dispatched my last, to you, when.

He entreated; told me it would prolong his life, if T would con Sent to be Mrs. Melmoth: for his. affairs were so embarrassed, he must otherwise retire to the South of France, and become an exile from his native country.

But why do I Say So I It was’determined on. Lord Eastmain. must have had strong aslurances,. or he would not have taken Such a jpurney, and bespoke in his way through town a Set of jewels as elegant as ever I Saw. Peregrine would drag the

of art used throughout the whole proceeding. Had your father commanded and threatened, I really believe you would have raised up a Spirit, and refused: : the right method was taken to conquer your generous temper. From the moment Mr. Villars wrote to Lord east main, I saw you were doomed a sacrifice to avarice and ambition. But you must make the best of it now. I like the old Peer, and cannot blame Melmoth for wishing such a treasure his; Who would not? But Somebody I must be angry with; arid who So much deserves it as your father? for once more I repeat, is Such exalted merit to be Sunk in Such a marriage? Were you a mere modern lady, it might do — Separate apartments, and a life of dilhpation. But the gentle Harriet, formed for domestic tenderness and tranquillity, will never be able to manage Melmoth. Were I the person, I could hold him with a curb bridle (a disagreeable office!) but you, who would govern with a Silken rein, and thereby break the thread of your office, would almost break your heart inconsequence. But Heaven avert those evils! I hope that Providence you depend on will prepare a reward for your virtue.

Saturday evening, and found the lovely, the languid Harriet at cards with Lord Eastmain, 6z: C But how inattentive! how I absent! how unlike the Harriet we have seen! Her countenance brightened up at my approach; it was observed by Melmoth : I gave him one of my looks, and brought him to order in a minute; when Harriet and I retired to our chamber; 
'for we slept together. We Said everything that could be Said on the occasion: but it all ended in this woeful truth, that, after what had pasted, her fate was inevitable; and, as such, I begged of her to put on a more cheerful countenance, left the lordly husband, in his day, should remember her relustance. She promised me she would observe my advice; and endeavour; but it was not in her power. At length the.dreaded Monday came; Joy in every countenance but harriet’s and her lucy’s yet I did all I could to be cheerful myself, and to make her so. But ’I have the advantage of most folks: what I want in natural good-humour, I 
Smake up in pertness; for I am never 
Sullen: and it is all onesto me, whether the company laugh at me, or with me. — The lovely girl was drested in a pale blue watered tabby robe gown and coat, 
( 91) 
Mechlin lace linen, her cap ornamented with pearls, one row of pearl round her neck, and bracelets of the Same upon her delicate arms : and in this manner, like a, lily overcharged with dew, was Ihe Jed by Lord Eastmain to the great parlour, and there by a Special licence joined to Mr. Melmoth. I, > who had leisure to observe every one, cannot help thinking that he Seemed rather to behave with an air of proud exultation than of tender joy. Mr. Villars and Peregrine are really joyful — for a joyful cause to them : but Lord Eastmain — I really revere the good old man — Scarcely knows how to Show his love and esteem for his new niece. 
— The jewels are come, and presented : poor Harriet received them with that sweetness which accompanies ail her actions. She placed them on her toilet, and with a deep Sigh Said,, “Oh! Lucy, 
“what have I given up for such bau“ “!” 1 endeavoured to laugh her 
out of her deplorables; for I would not for the world her husband should suspect her strong indifference to him. “Be “cheerful, Harriet, (said I) for I am “under the necessity of making rnyfelf ’ “a fool, that you may appear wife.’’ — • Her duty, of which she thinks So highly,

and her natural good temper, will make her a more exemplary wife, than hundreds who marry with their own consent. But it ought to be a very lively soul to keep melmoth’s astections awake; one that would make him look about him: for his intentions, I suppose, are, like those' of all the free livers, to govern by fear instead of love. — But hence resleclionsl No more complaints now : let me turn the bright Side of the prospest. The whole family will remain at rose Mount till after the birthday: Mrs. Melmoth is then to come to town incog, to take leave of my ladyship, as our family are to Set out for V‘ “■■■" in March or April j then they are to retire to Eastmain, there to restde till just before the breaking up of parliament, when Mrs. Melmoth is to be presented, as it is presumed she will by that tirhe be reconciled to her Situationj and that her countenance will resume its wonted Serenity, if Melmoth does not before that time break her heart. I say and unsay all in a breath : in efsest, I cannot persuade myself to any degree of liking or esteem for this man *, though I can give, no very particular reasons for entertaining any greater averhon fbr him, than for numbers of what are called the

You may remember, George, when we were at Florence, we took notice stf an englilti lady, who frequently went to the Britilh consul’s, and always returned with an air of dejection : you may likewise remember the offers of Service we both made her; when she modestly answered, 0 that her griefs were of Such a nature as not to admit of any relief we could give her. This very lady, drcffed in widow’s weeds, I Saw in the abbey church; she had with her a lovely girl, about four years of age. I Spoke to her; but she declined conversation with me. There appears Something So uncommon in her manner, that ray ciiriofity was raised to know what and who she is; but my endeavours were vain : for she quitted Bath the next day; and no one can tell from whence she came, or whither she is gone.

I CAME hither late last night, after accompanying ray Sisters as far as Dover,, in their way to Montpellier. — — ^ Since I wrote last, I have met with two adventures rather of the romantic kind. 
I • 
In my way from Bath, I thought 1 would cross the country, and pay a visit to my: 
old friend Admiral A -- -- --. I left the, 
coach, and mounted my horse, attended only by Abraham. I struck out of the great road, and upon the confines of a Small wood the sllrieks of a female voice awakened niy attention. I dismounted, and followed the sound of the voice till I came near a thicket, where were two ladies in a single horse chaise: the horse had taken fright, and entangling himself in the reins, was plunging in stidn^a.;, desperate manner, that their lives were in the most imminent danger. I cut the traces with the altistance of Abraham, who by that time had fastened the borsef,

and was come up. The youngest of the ' ladies (one of the most beautiful women I ever Saw) fainted away in my arms, as I was endeavouring to help her out of the chaise: the other, who appeared to be a woman of rank, and not of So delicate a texture as the fair one I Supported in my arms, told me, that, as they went to take an airing, Ihe (as she frequently did) had undertaken to drive the chaise; but their Servant had loitered Somewhere behind. Never in all my travels did I see So Sweet a creature as my charge; the true feminine softness appeared in every feature, in every aciion: but whether Ihe is maid, wise, or widow, I cannot Say: the former, I presume; for the lady was \ Scarcely recovered, when the Servant came up, and released Abraham from the talk of holding the horse. He was ordered home to bring a chariot with all possible Speed to farmer wells’s on the common, whither the ladies; permitted me to accompany them: indeed I was obliged to Support the younger, or she would have, been unable to reach the destined place. The farmer’s wife received them with the utmost respect; and I perceived Ihe knew them. She begged me to take Some refreshment: but, being to meet the coach

with ray Sisters at Reading, and finding no farther aid from me necessary.!.! my leave, lest I should be deemed impertinent. (The ladies had retired before I went.) Abraham waited at a distance with the horses, and So I could gain no intelligence concerning them. But I cannot put the idea of the amiable creature, whom Providence directed me to pieserve, out of my head: if she is a person of consequence, I shall See her again; if not,, time will efface the impreslion her person has made; and yet 1 dare say her mind is' worthy of that person; for it seemed to illuminate every feature. — And thus ended tfie first adventure. 
And, as if this were to be a week of such adventures, the morning after I came ‘ to town, as I had Sauntered into the grove' in the Green Park with thomfon’s scasons 
S 
in my hand; being tired, I Sat dovy n; and 
had Scarcely been Seated, before the fair widow and her child made their appearance. I rose to meet her; So that she could not avoid me without great rude -- ness. I begged her to be Seated, and, after a proper introduction, told her I was convinced She laboured under Some.

She is my lucy’s bosom friend : by copying her virtues I might make myself an interest with her, and thereby also with the.mistress of my fate. I am.

Pr E p a r e, my dear George, to hear strange things. You remember the amiable creature I assisted in the wood in. 
Berksliire. This agreeable woman is -- 
but let me tell the story regularly -- 
I went to the drawing-room last Thursday, and there, Sparkling as an angel, I Saw the incomparable woman, and Soon after heard her announced as Mrs. Melmoth. Good heavens! how was I struck to think that Providence had directed my steps to Save Lady lucy’s friend! I Shall, ever esteem it as the whitest hour of my life. Every eye was fixed on Mrs, Melmoth, who was indeed most graciously received by our matchless Queen, and received with becoming dignity the honours conferred on her. The behaviour of So Sweet a bride must do honour to the Sacred institution. When their Majesties were withdrawn, she whispered Lord Eastmain, who immediately turned towards me, followed by her. With ineffable sweetness 
she 
C IT 2 y 
she Said, “This is the gentleman, Sir, 
to whom I am So much obliged.” Then addressing herself to me, “My. “fright and illness, Sir, (Said She) at “that time prevented my making the “proper acknowledgments, or informing“ “of our. place of residence. Lady “C — F —, who was my companion, came down to give you our address, ‘‘ but you were gone.” His Lordship then desired me to favour them with my company as Soon as convenient. We were then joined by your brother and Mr. Melmoth : the former introduced me to them. As Soon as the name of Belgrave was mentioned, a line glow Over spread Mrs. melmoth’s face. She Said Ibmething,, to Charles in a low voice: what it was I did.not hear; but he Smiled. That evening I waited on them, with your brother and Sister. Our chief conversation turned on you and Lady Lucy. How fond are these two amiable women of each other !■ They seem indeed to have kindred souls. Your sister-in-law did not Seem very fond of hearing Lady lucy’s. praises — no wonder. Lord B. was there, brought by Mr. Melmoth: he Seemed to court my .acquaintance i but I could not behave So cordially to him as I could wish

Belgrave Soon restores her good-humour. We walk we read, we ride out: at Sometimes M go fishing; at others we join in a little concert: So our time is far from being disagreeably Spent, and my uncle is quite delighted : only, as I said before, your sister Sometimes yawns, especialiy'when we are reading, and wishes October was come; and then Lord Belgrave laughs and raillies her with Such a grace, that Ihe ' is obliged to laugh with him. Indeed his Lordship is master of Such persuasive eloquence as always to please, be the Subject gay or Serious. Never did I See so much wit and So much Solidity So happily ' blended. No wonder your brother'ihould esteem Such a man. Would they were brothers! Oh! that Such - a treasure would

with me. Lady S -- -- -- -- is a very discreet 
and amiable woman : she read me Some part of a letter which her brother had written to her; if he is Sincere, (and it certainly has an air of contrition) he will deserve respecf, as he So early Sees his error, and leaves his vices before they, have left him. The Ladies staid the evening. Our family were preparing for bed, when the bell rung at the outer gate; and presently Lord Belgrave made his appearance. ' He appeared much fatigued,

tigued, and apologised for coming at that late, or rather early hour, (for it was near three in the morning.) At breakfast he still appeared very languid, and very thoughtful: the moment breakfast was over, he retired, Saying that he had letters to write which would take up all his attention, but that he would dedicate the whole afternoon to us.. My uncle is under great uneasinefs on his account; for he esteems him as much as he does Mr. Melmoth. I suppose it is Some concern of the lady he has been to visit— — love quarrel, I dare Say 0^ — and yet She must have a very unfeeling heart to quarrel with Lord Belgrave for

would have been taken in my toils, but for her. Oh! how I hate her! I tried every art of “wilful woman labour“ “for her purpose” to sliake his firmness, but in vain. Like Rinaldo in the enchanted forest, he conquered, — carried all before him, — and left me, although it was four in the afternoon; and took post horses from the next town. I had my emistaries ready, and Soon learned the route he had taken was to Lord eastmain’s, where he had been for sometime before. It is not the gouty old man can engage him; nor Charles temple’s wife that can have any charms for him; it is Harriet Melmoth — How came she to know him? I suppose they talk over 
their

I had till yesterday Some faint idea of hope; but the post brought me a letter which has entirely Silenced that flatterer. In this fine Scrawl Belgrave tells me he can never See me more, incloses me a draught for another hundred pounds on his banker, and takes leave; earnestly wisliing me happiness. Nothing but a miracle can throw him into my power now. Remember. Revenge is the word; make,

she behaved in Such a manner, (and yet kept within the bounds of delicacy) that it was too much almost for a man to bear, I am not more than moital; I was ready to yield — ready to promise everything — in that moment of paltion, and doubtless foto fall a prey to the allurements of a Siren. When the idea of the divine ' Mrs. Melmoth darted into my head, how did this wanton fink in the eomparifon! 
’ Gan I (Said I to myself) look the virtuous 
Harriet in the face? That thought roused and' impelled me from the place. She followed me with looks that plainly indicated the Situation of her mind, and Spoke contending passions labouring in her breast. “Am I, am 1, (said fly)

— But enough of these matters. I would come to Hazzeldine Hall, were it practicable; but you know I have various ends to answer at this time. I have a great mind to take harriet’s necklace to town, and have it new fet : yet it would be rather impolitic now; the jewels must be my dernier resort. Farewell, Hazzeldine!

I am afraid ou will be wrecked cn the. other. Even a good woman may be the means of' making your life unhappy i the amiable Mrs. Melmoth may create you almost as much uneasmess as the frail widow; for, stould you entertain a pas

Love and esteem are widely different : the first is ever due to virtue and sense; the other is Spontaneous, and will operate ■ accordingly : nay farther, we often deceive ourselves in regard to this passion; and in that cafe it is not at ail wonderful if we appear to deceive others. Therefore your only Safety is in flight; and I hope to find you at Castlemont when I arrive; Since I need not alture that dear, very dear is your welfare to 
G. Mulcester. 
Before you do anything more for this fine widow, pray, my Frederick, inquire who and what Ihe is. I am not apt to be narrow minded; but I have my doubts concerning her. I have heard Some ac counts of Charles which give me pain; 
I wish you would inquire into the truth.. 
I will inclose you the letter. You will suppose i do not doubt the veracity of the. writer, but of his informant; and slander is apt to magnify obje ils. hov/ever, it is the honour of our family neison Seems to have at heart. — — I heard from Lucy yesterday; Sne inquired in a. very friendly manner after you; a favour Lucy Seldom' befiows on her male acquaintance.

Melmoth (yes, I must call him wretch) is an inseniible being; he is blind to the good that courts him; he Scarcely treats her with common civility. charles’s vdfe Seems to engage his present attention; they are continually coquetting; for Charles is absent on an occasion which I am afraid will end in his eternal dishonour. Mr. Villars is at the Spa, upon.another infamous account; and Peregrine is attending my hopeful brother. Mr. Melmoth is a libertine, in every sense of the word; he does not now even wish to Save appearances; he almost disdains to be thought virtuous, even in the presence of bis inestimable wife. Lord Eastmain is exceedingly hurt on the account, and has Spoken his mind to me Several times, but ' is loth to come to an open rupture on Kis beloved niece’s account. 
A great deal of money has been lost, 
I hear, at Newmarket; and Some unjufti stable meaps must be taken by the losers to retrieve themselves. How unbounded are the cravings of luxury!! love of fame was once esteemed the universal passion;; certainly at present the love of pleasure is more universal. Happy is it for those who make the first their

pursuit, if it teaches them to avoid the latter. 
The good old Peer Seems hasting to. the verge of fate; his health declines very fast. If he should be called to reap the reward of his virtues, poor Harriet will lose a much more affecbonate parent than her natural one has been to her. 
I must proceed very cautiously; ands yet tills amiable fellow must by some artifice be taken from hence. Do, .Ducy, write to your friend: She will start at being even suspected of entertaining a thought of Lord Belgrave. Do you, ih: your Sweet, ^ lively, yet Sentimental manner, point out her danger.

Lord Mulcester to Lady L Temple. 
\ 
1 am'under the greatest apprehensions, 
on your friend’s account. Lord east main has embarked for Lifoon, as, I told you in my last, his physicians had advised him: the tender, the grateful Harriet would have accompanied him, but he would not permit it, partly because bethought her presence might, perhaps, be Some restraint on Mr. melmoth’s conduist. 
An old gentlewoman, in the capacity of a nurse, and his chaplain, who is a pious sensible man, are his companions. Lord Belgrave and myself, with Mr. and Mrs. Melmoth, attended him to Portsmouth. 
■ — Melmoth is the most unfeeling being I ever Saw, except where his interest is concerned; then indeed he can appear all • softness. His uncle is really fond of him notwithstanding his faults: he has absolutely persuaded the good old gentleman (could you believe ito that a patent for a peerage will be obtained for him, and on the strength of it has obtained a considerable

able Sum of his Lordship, which will only increase his power of doing mischief. Harriet does not want penetration; and yet She too is continually made the dupe of Mr. Melmoth, and of her brother. The latter, hardened man, had the altii rance to alk the loan of two thousand pounds of me to pay a debt of honour, as he called it. I refused him, with some little indignation; and yet, for his filler’s sake, endeavoured to reason with him: but he is lost to all sense of reasoning. Good heaven! that a man should be so infatuated, as to put on the cast of a dye the estate of which he is in poifeirion Trom his ancestors! Yet who will deny, that he who hopes to win what belongs to another, deserves to lose his own? And here, my dear Lucy, let me observe, in the words of a favourite author, — There is Such a sameness in the lives, “the actions, the pursuits of libertines, ‘‘ and Such a likeness in the accidents, “punishments, and occaslons for remorse“ “attend them, that I wonder they “will not be V ?arned by the beacons V which are lighted up by every brother “libertine whom they know; and that “they will so generally be driven on the “Same rock, overspread and Surrounded

‘‘ as it is, in their very Sight, by a thou 
Sand wrecks.’’ -- -- -- -- -1 am, as I before 
observed, extremely concerned for Mrs. Melmoth : she is very ill; she visibly falls away, 'and her fine complexion fades; yet she takes gfeat pains to appear lively and cheerful. But this brute, the husband, will sliorten her days, unless he reforms.; and that, from the nature of the cafe, at present cannot be expected— — do not believe he has dined at home for these ten days, and have Some reason to think they have Separate apartments. — Oh! the poor Harriet! how hard is her cafe! and what must: this monster think of himself I The good Mrs. Vareny is with her at present, and I hope will administer some comfort to her, which I am Sure she wants, although she is too delicately nice to complain. — Lord Belgrave is always here, but when hours of decency compel him to retire. As there is no .keeping him from the house, I endeavour to be with him as much as possible. Harriet Seems, to avoid him as much as she can, without being particular; — Charles and his 'Lady are on very indifferent terms; her Ladyship, on Something that Charles had Said to her, slew away to her aunt i harman’s; and there she has been theses: three

three days past. Charles has humbled to her - even to meanness (not .from love, I believe); he has great expectations from Lady harman’s fortune. The whole polite circle Sit in judgement on this modern couple. Both aunt and niece console themselves with Mr. Melmoth, who is their Cedfiaeo, conducting them to all public places. You will perhaps say, my Lucy, that I am a retailer of Scandal: but I would rather that you Should hear those disagreeable truths from me than from another. As for Charles, unthinking as he is, he would not like to be honoured with a certain name in his wife's power to bestow. — I remember a clu' racler almost Sistiilar, delineated by a great genius, who 'puts these words into his mouth:.

“I always thought her a coquet, 
“But never dreamed she wronged me yet: “Altho’ 1 do not dote upon her, 
I cannot brook insulted honour; 
‘‘ Nor do I think it to be born,

I can Scarcely Speak civilly to her, or her aunt: she is wrong to encourage her in a. breach of duty, efpecialiy when (he

knows the world has began to make free with her character; she depends on her ' great riches. Indeed, Lucy, I am displeased with all the world,, but Mrs. Melmoth and Lord Belgrave; and they are doomed to make each other unhappy. 
I See briers, thorns, and a pathless track besore them. My mind, my dear Lucy, is Saddened with apprehensions for Lord Belgrave, and for the amiable Harriet. 
I would fain tear myself from a subject which at present will intrude itself on me : for the purport of this long incoherent letter was to beg his Lordship would write to Lady Harman, and inform her how free licentious tongues have made with her niece’s name, and what foundation her condtkl has given for such freedoms. It is nis duty as a parent; and I hope her Ladyship will exert herself on this occasion, as the honour of our, house is So much concerned. Adieu, my Sister!

Mr. Melmoth to Sir J. Hazzeldine. 
ERE is the devil to pay Hazzeldine -- Lady Charles lost three 
thousand with Count Alberini on Tuesday night! She did not go home till Six in. the morning. — Charles had ordered another bed to be made for himself: that gave her no great concern; but the loss,, such a sum gave her more chagrin than I fupposed Such a Spirit was capable of. She Sent for me at eleven : I, as in duty bound, though with great difficulty, procured and lent her the money. She then Sent for Charles to breakfast; but he went out without vouchsafing to Send an answer. She ordered her horse, and we took an airing in Hyde Park. When we returned, we understood Charles had Sent home for some clothes, but left no word whither he was gone, or when he should return. Madam flamed out, and exclaimed, “That She would not be ‘‘ slighted — she who brought such a for“

“tune! — She would go to her aunt’s, 
“and she would have a Separate main“ “I was pleased to hear this; 
“it is my plan to keep up her resentments. 
“It is really monstrous, (Said I) Madam, 
“that you are not Suffered to Spend your “own money, as you like. For you, 
‘‘ who have brought him almost a princely “fortune, to be restrained in yoiir hours “like a slave, is a thing not to be born. ' 
“— Liberty is a principle implanted in “the breast' of every Britisli woman : 
“the meanest wretch will contend for 
“liberty.’’ -- -- (I then thought of what 
Poll Perkins Said to the constable of the night, who had taken her into custody for being riotous at an improper hour: 
“You had better let me go; for my “dear Wilkes Says confinement is not ‘‘ conjiitutionablea Poll mistook the word; but i’ had great estect on lire constable, > for (he got her discharge.) I improved on this hint to her Ladyship, and conduced her to her aunt’s; Charles, not fuspecfing her to be thercy came to complain; and Lady p] r.man treated him as the old dutchess of Maijbcrough is Said to have treated the Duke of Mc: : tagu, who came to complain of his wife’s conduct : How dare you (fays ihe) make

“Such complaints to me? My daughter 
“was a virtuous woman when you mar“ 
“her; and if you had not conduct“ 
“to keep her So, you have a 
‘‘ great deal of effrontery to tell me of 
“it.” Some Such Speech Lady Harman 
made. An excellent tutoress for a young 
lady! you will say. I could not help 
laughing. Charles walked chasing about 
the room — “Mr. Melmoth, (Said he) I 
“did not expecl this from you: What 
“would you Say, were Mrs. Melmoth to 
‘‘ act thus imprudently (The very 
thought made me whistle.) — Before I had 
V time to make him an answer, his meek 
helpniaie began — “Mrs. Melmoth is no

“do you think would compare herself 
“to Such a piece of still life as Mrs, 
“Melmoth? If jjje chooses to run about 
“the house like a tame pigeon, that is 
“no reason that I should: : have better 
“notions of freedom, and a power to 
“Support them.” — (So much the better, 
thougnt I; Bravo! Lady Charles.) -- -- -- -- 
With these words ' and a violent toss of 
the head, ihe quitted the room. Good 
ma ulers made me offer to withdraw; but 
La : T Harman insisted on my staying. 
She had no Secrets, she Said. She talked 
of

t 
( '45) 
of applying to the Earl and countess; said they had dearly purchased an alliance with a family of quality, if her niece was to be denied the privileges allowed to all other women of rank. — (What are' those privileges. Sir James? I think they are comprised in these three articles — spending their hujbandf fortunes — dijbonourmg their names — and Suing for separate maintenances; 
— and all this because they dare.) -- -- -- -- 
Now my Cara Spofa is in the other extreme: she will give one no hold on her. It is easy to perceive Belgrave loves her to distraction; I wish she did him : but she is as the elegant Mrs. Hall Says on another occasion, a perfecl composition of iced cream. If she had half the penchant for him he has for her, they would elope; and then Castlemont should pay for all. I give them all the opportunities they could wish;; in vain. Cupid is foiled; all his arrows are blunted by hervey’s Meditations. young’s Night thoughts, or Some such enthusiastic antidote. Besides, there is that Sage Mentor, 
Lord Mulcester, continually at his elbow. 
I will Sound him about advancing Some money for his fister in law : I will point out to him the temptations to which want of ready cash may make her liable : 
I warrant you I will tell him a tale that

'Well, I Succeed— — Ladyship chose to figure away as Diana; a chaste character, and well adapted to the place: : ^ Sure at the Pantheon chaste Dian keeps her court. I went high with expectation; when, behold! who fhould*"be her escorts but her, aunt and her Lord? and there was she, in Spite of their presence, coquetting with Harry Hargrave. The devil take the Sex! thought I; every Soul of them follows the old trade of driving man out of paradise. I was pla guily nettled,, and fearful, lest Sir Harry (he is a handsome, clever fellow,, you know) should take a fancy — to her jewels also. I had only a domino on at first but I whipped out, and changed my dress to that of a huntslnan, ind was with her again in an instant. I offered her my Service, and followed her with my horn the whole evening, and Sung her a verse of one of boyce’s old ballads. There were Several diana’s in the room; therefore' this Said verse Soothed her vanity beyond expression— — if it did not.

“The goddess by her mien.” 
She bridled and flirted after this. I do not think she knew me at first; but I took care she should before we parted, or my pains and flattery would have been ill bestowed. I am relblved to have admittance this evening. 
When I returned home, I was given to understand that my dainty wife was 
extremely ill. -- -- -- Peace be with her! 
thought I; I am Sure I will not disturb her. As I was dressing this morning, Lord Mulcester Sent up his compliments. I was obliged to admit him, tho’ I wistied him at the devil: but it' is not politic to 
quarrel with one in his Situation. -- -- Oh! 
Such a leciure as I had from him on my conduo; in general, and my behaviour to Mrs. Melmoth in particular! excusing himself on the friendship he bore my uncle and Harriet. How were all her virtues Set forth, and ten times more than she or any woman ever had! “He was

then in the most plaintive manner did I complain of her disregard; that her indifference to me obliged me to be from home oftener tloan I would be; that I was careless of everything, Since I found I could not poitcss her heart. “You do not know, my dear Lord Mulcester,

(said I, withdrawing to the window, and taking out my handkerchief.). You know ' 
I am able to enter into any character, and my mufcies and features are entirely ooe — dient to my will. In short, I persuaded him that Harriet was, at least in some degree, blameable. — What a comfortable thing is assurance! and how are those virtuous wise heads taken in! A Servant was dispatched with a compliment to ' Mrs. Melmoth, begging Lord Mulcester might be permitted to See her. “Do,

Sir J A M E S H A Z z E L D I N E to Mr, 
Melmoth. 
Yks, Jack, I am able to travel now; for I am going for Derby tomorrow. I have a tale for your tale; a tale that will beat fifty Such as yours. But let me begin in order: You mentioned Seeing Nancy Spencer at the play: she was come to town with the old Knight on an extraordinary occasion, which you shall hear in its course. Last week I ' was trying (the season being So fine) whether 1 could walk to. the keeper’s house, preparative to my journey to town. I Saw a post chaife and four strike out of the London road across the park.' I stalked Lack as fast as I could, supposing it to contain Some one of our old com panionst' but I was greatly Surprised to See a lady in deep mourning, her bonnet over her face, who desired to Speak with me. 1 offered the lady (a fine, graceful woman!) my hand, but did not See her face till we entered the parlour; when who should present herself hut — Isabella! 
I Sur 
• » 
(' ‘) 
I Surveyed her round and round — What: 
'occaslons this alteration? Are you in: mourning for the loss bf Melmoth ?" 
“Hang Melmoth! (Said, the brazen facen 
“my dress is to answer a much better “purpose : let us have tea, and Fli test ' 
“you” - — And Ihe began thus :. You, 
“may have heard that Sir Charles Bai“ “- had a Sister who married the clerk of a Spanish merchant,, and thereby, 
“disobliged her friends, who value them“ 
“'(foolish distinction in a commer 
“dal. country!) that not one of their ' ‘‘ family was ever, contaminated, with; 
“trade. Well, this lady (whose name “by marriage became.del Rio) having, 
“in vain Solicited Teconciliaiion from her. ‘^‘haughty family, she not being of age,.. 
“received of an. honest Jew two thousand“ 
“of four, for her fortune, and, ‘vembarked with her husband for. the, 
“Spanisli West-indies, where he acquired. 
“a prodigious fortune. His wife, and.a “Son he had by her, died;, and there was ^ 
“only a daughter left called Suiannah “after her mother; and this daughter is, 
“Sole heiress to his vast polseslions, ' She. 
“was Sent home with a, lady, of rankc “who was returning to Europe, and was “placed under the care of an eminent, banker at Paris;, her father thirling

‘‘ the severity of the Spanisli manners “too great, and wisliing the Spanisli re“ “to be Softened by a polite French “education. He did riot choose England, “lest she should be perverted, or con verted, or whatever he pleased to term it. Well, the round of days and years 
“Went on — Mr. Del Rio chose to end 
/ 
*‘ his days in Europe. He loved his “wise, and wished to See Some of her “family, although they had treated him “with Such disdain. This man (a much “better Papist, than Sir Charles and his “Sister Lady cosway are Protestants) Sent “his compliments to Sir Charles and the aforesaid Lady, to acquaint them with ‘‘ his arrival, in England. He was re“ “with raptures — Oh! the power “of riches! No wonder you and 1, Sir “James, (the hustey put herself on a “footing with me it hurt my pride) 
“should take all means to gain them. — No objections now against his religion; “which was the principal one urged “against miss susannah when she mar ried him. Well, they met, and were P brother and sister, and So forth; and ‘‘ all went with great parade to vistt their niece at the convent where she was placed. This young lady, by agree“ “of the father’s was to be united 
“to

“to the young Marquis de R -- -- -- -- -. But • 
“good Mr. Del Rio paid the debt to ‘‘ nature a few weeks past, and left Sir “Charles and an eminent Spanisli mer“ “guardians to this young lady; 
“and those pious persons determined to “circumvent this Marquis, and marry “her to their own cub young Sir Mar“ “cosway, as Soon as he can “come from Eton School, and be licked “into form; and thereby to preserve the “vast fortune and title in their own “family. 
What opinion can you or I have ' “of religion, when the professors of it (Lady Cofway is one) can disobey its “diclates? I remember my mother told “me, when I was a good girl and read my Bible, that we Should be cunnmg “as Serpents and harmless as doves; and “that our conversation sliould be meek “and lowly, and, according to the cate“ “we should neither covet nor “desire other men’s goods: but I believe “it is all a jest, or the first people in the j “nation, Bisliops and all, would not “prefer worldly grandeur and riches to 
“those precepts. -- -- For instance; Sir 
“Charles Barham,. although he could “pretend tp be angry with his Sister for “marrying a profested member of the r ‘‘ church 
a 
( 158) 
“chiirch of Rome, yet at the Same time' kept a mistress, and broke his lady’s “heart; and by his sondness for Nancy “Spencer, although a good girl in her way, did the same by his Son, who, as “you know, died a twelvemonth fmce. 
'“Now what can be thought of this conduct?? not the most abandoned ^ of us all start' at the thought of rob“ “another man of his right on whom “we had no claim, or the impiety of not “fulfilling the will of the dead, had not “thpfe gospel profeslbrs taught us the “way? 
“But as, without faith, I atf only (as ‘‘ Square Says) according to the rule of “right, I think it more meritorious to ' “bestow miss del Rio on you, than oa 
“Marmaduke cosway, as he can by no “means deserve her. He is a mere “prince of coxcombs. You have gene ‘‘ rosity in your nature, and will allow “her in conjunistion with yourself to “’spend her money. But Sign, and Seal “too, what you will bestow on me an<l “Nancy, who Sent for me post on the “occasion, and your bufmess shall be, “done.” 
I promised her, and bound myself with 
the strongest asteverations; for you know

and bell’s) help: nay, I gave her a bond, as I had stamps in the house, which my worfhip’s clerk filled up, and will be executed in proper time. — Sir Charles, at the time you Saw Nancy at the play, came to town to receive his niece. Lady cosway was gone to Paris to conduct her to Dover, from whence She was to proceed to Derbysliire. (But Nancy was to have a taste of the town by the way, and return incog.) 
Now the Scheme concerted between Nancy and Isabella is this : — isabella has already taken a house in Derby, pasting for a widow with one child, (a beautiful female one stie has) her name Conway; 
— did not choose to restde in or near the metropolis, as it reminded her ‘ of her deceased husband;; — already consulted Sir Charles about purchastng a little estate in the neighbourhood. She was stnfto duced as a lady of character, and a tolerable fortune, by Sir Thomas Webley. Lord Belgrave, who was on. a vistt to the Duke of D -- -- -- -- -- -, and who had formerly 
i Seen her in Italy in an advantageous light, again Saw her in church, and bowed to her j and conversed with her for sometime as they came out of church. This raised her in the opinion, of the neighbouring gentry. But the best joke of all 
is,

is, that whenever Mrs. Conway choofes to consult Sir Charles on any businefs at

Sanguine wishes. I was received at Derby by that ephesian Matron, Mrs. Conway, with much joy — But no Nancy; stie must not appear in Such company. She went thro’ the town in Sir charles’s chariot; I asked, before a Lady of the town (a morning visitant) and the Servant who was attending with chocolate, what pretty lady that was? I was answered, with much disdain, ‘ “A kept “woman of Sir Charles barham’s and then the outijageously virtuous Mrs. Conway wondered how Such creatures dared to appear in public. In short, no one can top the part better. I ought first. to premise, on Sir Thomas webley’s account, Lady cosway (whose Seat is three miles distant from the town) made a visit to Mrs. Conway, and invited her to a private ball at her house. They curt’sey at church, join the same Set at the card astembly, and have a most fastiionable intimacy. I must own, I was afraid that 
Lord

( 162) 
Lord Belgrave would have been present at the monthly astembly; but his visit was only en pajfant. ■ I was introduced by one of the members of the county, and complimented with opening the ball, which I did with Lady Cofway; her Ladysliip declining a Second minuet, I took out her niece, a mild moaeft iook ing young lady, rather too much of a brunette (owing to the dimate in which she was born) to be deemed handsome in •england; but, taking her all together, she is very agreeable. It is lucky for me that I can Speak Spanisli So fluently, (that, benefit I received from my cousm waller) as Lady Cofway is So very watchful over her, and Speaking So universal a language. as French would be nearly the Same as, 
’ Speaking English to her. 1 went down two country dances with her; but, fearful of making too free with my leg, and miss Del Rio, (who, as it may be fupposed, was no adept in English country dances) we Sat dowm. Lady cosway with us! I took great pains to remember (having long neglected geography) the situation of the city where she was born. You cannot think how delighted she was she had met with one that could Speak her native language, and describe her country. In all this discourse I did not 
'make 
( ISS) 
i 
make one compliment to her person : no, 
I must insinuate myself by degrees. I praised Lady Cofway for taking her under her care; as it would be a dreadful thing, 
I Said, for Such a young Lady to be left in this dangerous world without a female relation to guide her steps. "I then hinted that Sir Charles had put it out of his power to receive her. She teemed quite pleased, and launched, out on her brother’s imprudence. In short, I So conducted myself, that I dare say I shall be a favourite with the old lady — I wish I may with the young one. I .Shall certainly gain my point, could I make myself master of her heart; her person would follow of course: and away we would ’ take a jaunt to the land of matrimony. Everything has concurred to favour my design;; season of the year; that most of the people of fashion are in town; no Smart officers to attradst the eye (as is generally the case in a country town) — 
I being consequently (without vanity) the cleverest fellow here at present, and the first who has conversed much with her, as she Speaks Such very imperfeci Englisli; then appearing as a trustee to a widow and an orphan — all these things make me a respectable character. Mrs. Conway gave them an invitation to a little concert

the aforesaid Mr. C -- -- -- -- --, Member for

played the violin; and the young lady and Mrs. Conway Sung by turns. Our guests were highly delighted. We are to Spend this day at Cofway Hall. Her Ladysliip begs, as I Speak Spanhh so well, I would endeavour, to teach Miss Del Rio English, as I can explain the meaning of the words better to her than one who does not understand her native language — an agreeable task to me. I will endeavour to teach her another leiton — eloisa and Abelard — Hey! Jack — A fine story for a novel this will be — love elopements all the ingredients requisite. — -1 am' preparing for my visit to cosway Hall. The chariot is to be Sent for Mrs. Conway and Miss; for Mrs. Conway is so prudent, she never leaves her child to the care of Servants, I go in my chaise, with all my attendants, in honour to the ladles: Tom and Ned carry their french horns.

tilings go on as we could wish; that both the widow and myself are great favourites v/itt all parties. The old Knight tells her everything, and laments that she cannot be present at any amusements; but Says he will make her amends: he has given her a fifty pound bank note by way of doceur; and Nancy comforts herself with the thought that, if we Succeed, she shall Soon be independent of them all. She Says, she is ready to burst to see the airs which Bell gives herself at church, and what an humble distance she (Nancy) is obliged to keep : nay, for that matter, it is as much as Tom can do to keep his countenance. But 1 have promised them a handsome present, and a place each in Some of the public offices if they are diligent and faithful. Do you hold yourself in readiness, lest we should be Surprised. Scrape together all the money you can, no matter on what terms: if we Succeed, we can well afford to pay any premium or interest that is required; if we do not, why, they who advance must lose their money, that is all; we shall be the worst off.

Yo u will wonder, my dearest Harrkt, at hearing from me So Soon again: but Mr. plefhoff is going off with a Secret commission— — of state unknown to us females— — undertakes to bring this to you. I told him, by way of reward, he should See the loveliest English woman that ever graced our unsettled climate. But allow me, my dearst creature,

Lord Eaftmain, I trust, will Soon be with you, and he will See justice done you, I make no doubt, both as to what concerns your person and fortune : and many happy days may you yet See, and much good may you still do, if you will not give way to grief. Lord mulcester’s last letter almost broke my heart. Why do you not Speak out I why do you not complain? I should then have hopes of you. But this Silent

I have also written in very Severe terms. — Poor Lord Belgrave, amiable, worthy youth! 1 wish he would take a trip to the continent; for I am afraid (all innocent as you are) of that vile tongue of Anne Temple — Need I say more to one of your penetration and delicacy?

“As Rochefoucault his maxims drew

I am afraid that I Sometimes verify it; for, Since the account George has given of Mr. melmoth’s behaviour, my father and mother have forborn even to try to influence me in any one’s favour, or I do not doubt but this northern nobleman ' would have been as strongly recommended as Lord B. was.

They happened to join company on a Shooting party, and afterwards, at the tavern in the village, entered into a discourse on politics; and our hopeful heir, alike ignorant and impudent, was very impertinent. The young officer made him a morning visit, not choosmg to trust a challenge by a Servant, and invited him to meet him the next day in a wood near the house. Poor cosway, frightened out of his sliallow senses, told his mother: she applied to me, and proposed going to Sir Charles, and binding them over. I told her that wopld make too much noise, and I would undertake to settle the affair, or take up the challenge mystlst She Sincerely thanked me, and blested me. (So, you See, it would be no matter if I was shot through the head, if master'v/as Safe.) So I waited on this martial man; a young lad of mettle indeed! I told him, Sir Marmaduke was not much skilled in the weapons of offence. “I believe So, (laid “he) but he should not affront a gen“ “without being able to give a “gentlemanlike Satisfaction.” And he violently Swore to it, if he did not meet him, he would cane him in the face of the whole town. With much persuafion,

and promise of Safety, I prevailed oa mamma to permit her darling, under my protection to go to the wood. Accordingly we went; and a woeful figure the Baronet made, his face as pale as a cam brick handkerchief. The Son of Mars was punctual to his time. Pistols were produced: I interfered, and begged, if possible, the matter might be compromised. He alked me, what sort of Satisfaction I, as a gentleman, thought he deserved.? 1 was obliged to own I thought Sir Marmaduke ought to beg his pardon. This was complied with; the pistols fired in the air; they sliook hands; and back we went to cosway Hall to dinner, all in high good-humour. The Lieutenant is treated with great respect, and I am perfectly adored. The booby Baronet will not stir without me; and I have obtained the following piece of intelligence, that, you will own equals pitt’s diamond: for I am in all his Secrets. But I will give it you in his own words — “Sir James, (Said he) do you know our folks want me to marry this Spauifh cousin of V mine? but I do not like hr, for more reasons than one.

Lord mulcester'to Lady L Temple.

\ 
I AM Sorry, my dearest Lucy, that I 
have no comfort to give you on your • unhappy, amiable friend’s account. What Mrs. Vareny wrote you of Melmoth is too true. I would, if possible, have concealed that, and Some other disagreeable circumstances, from you: but by Some means you will hear it; therefore it may better come from me. Poor Harriet! she is confined to her room: (he pleads illness; but I am Sure it is from some brutal treatment of that abandoned wretch. Jenny told me, in confidence, the marks of violence are visible. Belgrave guesses the matter — But I stiall come to it in course. On Monday was se’nnight there was a private party at Mr. mdmoth’s: Lady Harman and her niece were there; for Mrs, Melmotli (from regard to our family) behaves to them as politely as file can, considering how much she must dislike their conduct on all occasions. I should have first told you, that I dined 
there 
ft 
( rii) 
there by invitation, no one being present but Mr. and Mrs. Melmoth. aster Harriet withdrew, he had the asturance -- Shall I call it it is too Soft a name — to alk me for more money. My looks Spoke my astonisliment, as he must suppose I could not be ignorant of what had become of the other, as Mrs. vareny’s letter informed' you. I told him, I really could not advance any more, except Lord east main joined in the Security. This effectually Silenced him. I took my hat, and was going; but he begged my pardon, although with a stifled resentment, as I could plainly perceive; and entreated me not to go, as his wife would fuspect Something if I did. I would not quarrel with him for that excellent sufferer’s Sake therefore Sat down again. He then Said he wished he had made a better use of what I advanced before, and intimated Something of being taken in, and of Sharpers and gamesters. “Mr. Melmothi “taken in!. (I Said) You, Sir, are no“ “in the. ways of the town.” ^ — Lord Belgrave and Some other company coming in, prevented farther conversation. But now I must clear up another point to you: At the time when I reconciled this 
brute to his wife, I advanced Mrs. Mel

and Servants wages; five hundred of which he found means to get from her the next day, whereby the honest intent with which it was lent was frustrated. This, togethtr with five hundred more borrowed on the most exorbitant terms, was lost at stapleton’s in a few hours, ■ Poor Harriet, in the utmost perplexity, applied to Peregrine for relief; he told me : and from what little she Said to him, 
7 
, and from what I learned from others, 
'. ^ ^ 7 
I came by my intelligence; not one particle from Mrs. Melmoth : nor indeed would I give her So much pain, as to make her suppose I am acquainted with her ill timed confidence in her worthless husband. Yet why do I blame her, on a judgement founded on the event only? Difficult Situations occasion wonder at a person’s conduct when the wonderers cannot accg'unt for that Situation. -- -- -- -- -- To 
proceed :. The card party met; Lord Belgrave did not choose play, but leaned 
over Lady S -- -- -- -- -- -- chair, Melmoth 
v'hispered his wife, who withdrew, and he followed her: when Ihe returned, it was visible to me, (the rest of the com 81 p2ny were too much engaged with their 
play to mind' her) that Ihe was difeom posed, and the traces of tears on her cheeks. Frederick, who watches every

turn of her countenance, appeared to be .much astecied. Our hopeful sister, who• Sat almost opposite, on observing him,, burst into a loud laugh, like an unfeeling,, hardened, insolent woman. Lord Belgrave, not hearing her ill natnred laugh; addreired Mrs. Melmoth, and begged, in. the tenderesl manner, to know Whether Ihe felt any returns of her lately recovered illness. I Saw Melmoth look at them, who Said, in a Sarcastic manner to Charles, 
“i’ll be hanged if the Sober Lord Bel“ “is not riiaking love to my wife Nature will be Nature, you; know, 
“Charles; Amor vincet omniav This' open attack, although meant as raillery,, gave me great pain for both niy friends. The Sweet Harriet, with too much Sen — fibiliiy for her present weak frame. Seeing, all eyes fixed on her, although she could ' hot tell for what reason, as She had not attended to what was Said, was so much abaslied that She was near fainting Lady Charles, as she is called, again took occasion to throw out Some indelicate witti cisms. I checked her Severely. “I meant “nothing, Said she, only a little harmless 
‘‘ raillery.” “Raillery, returned I; no “longer deserves to be regarded as Such,, 
“when it trangresles the bounds of goodi “manners and decorum:, besides, when

“gross, it loses all that fharpness, by “which alone it is allied to wit : it is 
N 
“theft wounding clumlily with a hatchet, “instead of touching with the keen point “of a lancet.” This stopped her career for that time; but she watched the first opportunity to make reprisals. When I could Speak to Frederick without being observed, I told him of Mr. melmoth’s 
remark : it made him start, and look very Serious, The infernal Lady Anne Soon guested the cause: “So, my Lord, (Said she) you have had a leclure as well as “myself; and here is a Supplement to “it, a Sermon came all the, way from 
“V -- -- -- .” She then took out your 
letter; “Here (cried she) read it, my Lord Belgrave, for the good of the “company.” d his was too much to be born; for her air and manner were more insolent than her Words. “Madam, (Said “Charles to her) please to desire Lord “Belgrave to give me the letter, as it restecls much more honour on the. writer, than on the person fb justly “rebuked.” Mercy on mef (returned “She) are you turned preacher too“ “will this world come to!” “A

and every one again Seemed attentive to their cards : but Charles took his leave of the company, and, this, joined to Sime more cogent reasons, occasioned them to have Separate apartments, as they have had Separate inclinations for a great while. Before the company broke up, I slipped a pocket book into Mrs. melmoth’s hand with notes for five hundred pounds, to make what use of them her prudence might dictate; observing, that I would Settle it with Lord Eastmain at his return. But one good has arisen from this disagreeable evening: poor frederick’s eyes are opened; he now sees the danger of his Situation; he acknowledges Mrs mel moth is too amiable for his repose, and that Yis only Safety is in slight:, he therefore proposes to he in Paris, and thence 
to proceed to V -- -- -- -- -- -: but that will only 
be to cherisli his hopeless love; for you will both So fervently Join in her praises, that it will be continually reminding him of her perfeclions. He sets out next week. I leave all to your prudence. We both called at Mr. melmoth’s the day after f the aforesaid evening; but were told that lady was very ill, and kept her room; but I cannot find any physician attends her. Jenny had been weeping.

I Seemed to credit the whole farce; So we parted good friends. The Baronet, under pretence ’ of going to Reading, staid behind to pursue his pur pose, which I suppose will end in a trip to Scotland. But hear the Sequel — When I returned, I found a most terrible had happened at home — duns upon duns, and threatenings without number from isaac. 1 was consumedly plagued at this important time — No money, nor any possibility of raising any, except Lord Mulchesler would advance, or my fool of a wife would endeavour to raise Some..

Lord Belgrave slew to her to learn what occasioned her dejection; but the perverfc idiot would not then avail herself of the infatuation that was visible to every eye, to get a few thousands, though She might have done it, and vented her Spleen into the bargain. I was confounded mad; and when the company went away, 1 marched off to the Piazza, and staid till morning.

will give me no chance. Either death or a divorce would do; I care not which : but, as I Said before, she will give me no hopes. I am Sure she regards Belgrave; yet not one word or acfion escapes her, that can give .the least room for censure - less to ground any Suit on. What must I do.? her white angel and my black one must have a struggle. 
But the worst of all is, that Belgrave sets off tomorrow for Paris, in pursuance of his tutor. Lord mulcester’s direcuon. I have but one hope, which rests on her keeping herself very private; and, as (he. has denied to See Lord Belgrave, and even Mulcester, it Seems as if she wislicd to keep the fracas a Secret. 
Sir Marmaduke called in his way back; he Seemed full of Some important matter, which you know by this time, I suppose. 
I itiill Set out for d to morrow, and 
tamper with Mrs. Harris. Perhaps, by my return, my fair implacable may venture to get out of her pouts. Make haste, Hazzeldine; for both our affairs are on a crisis, either to Shine, or be quite annihilated. It depends on vigilance, which lam Sure will be exerted by you, as well as by

To a world beyond this, I doubt, she must look for a reward. Lord Belgrave is to be pitied also; for an attachment like his, neither Seas, distance, nor the hand of time can lesten. Several women of rank and merit in this country, as well as in England, have felt, to their,, cost, the power of his fine person and manners: one lady in particular made him an offer of her person, but met with no returns from Belgrave. His fair friend has made him eyeless and lifeless to every other beauty.

I Saw a parcel of ill looking creatures in the hall, and the lady herself in her dreffing room in tears? — Lleaired from J: nny, that an execution was brought ~~ into the houle from one isaacs, a Jew. broker; that Mr. Melmoth had been ab sent for three days, and no one could give an account of him. I comforted the amiable Sufferer as well as I could, and Sent for my attorney intending to Secure the plate, furniture, $jc. to Mrs. Melmoth. But this debt, or. pretended debt,., is for five thousand pounds: I paid part ' of the money, and gave. Security for the remainder; determining to go to east main to Mr. Hunter, the steward, who resides on the estate, and is really a very honest man. But news arrived that evening, that Mr. Melmojh and Sir James hazzeldine had carried off an heiress, niece of Lady cosway; and had likewise been the meins of Sir Marmaduke cosway, who is not of age, running to Scotland with a young woman of doubtful

character. A Lord chief justice’s warrant was istued to Search the house; but, by his lordsliip’s order, all respect was Shown to Mrs. Melmoth, and her word was taken. The next day an advertisement appeared in the Hague Gazette, describing all the parties, and Specifying that the minister in Holland had refused to marry them. Lady cosway is in town, and applied to me ^ the guardians, with proper authority, immediately went to Holland, but in vain; for they had made their escape to French Flanders; and the Ldy, being a catholic, no doubt will meet with protection. 
harriet’s tender nature is overcome with these tumults: she took to her bed the moment the Gazette appeared, which Charles, through inadvertence, had brought to her. I entreated Mrs. Vareny Sometimes to look in on her in my absence. On my return to town, I met a mestenger from Mr. Vareny at Colnbrook, who informed me of Some of the following melancholy particulars; the rest I learned from Mrs. Vareny, poor Jenny, and Booth. The Second night after I fet out, Mr. Melmoth came to bis own house in disguise about midnight. Mrs. Melmoth was much better that day than she had been for Some time past, and was then

He addrelted her very abruptly, and alked her for her keys, as he Said that he had been informed, from good authority, sire carried on a clandestine correspondence with Lord Belgrave. “It “is false, (laid Jenny, in the height of zeal for her mistress) my lady will not “do anything clandestine.*’ The brute took the faithful creature by the arm, and put her out of doors, though it was ■ midnighti and Booth followed her to a neigiibouring house, and got her a lodg -- ing, and then returned to See that no violence was offered to his lady, who,, not apprehending the wretch’s intention,, had given him her keys. He took her jewels, and packed up all the plate, and delivered it to his myrmidons, five or Six of whom were in waiting. And this was his pretence for the keys. The common ■ Servants were all in bed; and Booth, as his lady gave no orders, did not think proper to interfere. As Soon as Melmoth had quitted the house, which was about two in the morning. Booth brought Jenny back to his mistress, who at daylight stole away to Mrs. Vareny. That worthy' lady came immediately to the weeping: angel: but by this time the house was filled with fheriff’s'. officers. Mrs. Vareny took Mrs. Melmoth home with her. —

known: but guess my surprise, at my arrival, to hear from an old person who was left in charge of the house, that the ladies had been gone away twenty hours before, and no one could tell whither. 
I returned much chagrined, and was inclined to apprehend that Melmoth had found her out; and yet I think k could Scarcely be possible, as he is under the threat of the law. I had just changed my dress after my journey, when Charles came with an account that was current in all the coffeehouses, and Soon after confirmed by a letter from Sir James Hazzeldine to Mr. Ashford, that Lord Belgrave had wounded Mr. Melmoth (as it was apprehended, mortally) in a duel; that this rencounter happened near cambray;; that Belgrave had taken Mrs, Melmoth away. harriet’s not being to be found gives sanciion to the report — to the Scandal, I ought to Say V for Scandal I am Sure it is: altho’ Mrs. B — — t, like Mrs. Blast in the Spectator, has, tired three pair of horses to sly about the town and tell every one she comes near, that Mrs. Melmoth has run away with Lord Belgrave, and that his Lordship, has run Mr. Melmoth through the body, as the former was endeavouring to take his wife 
from him. Inconsistent as this story is, 
it 
ft 
( 2'o8) 
it gains ground : both Mrs. Vareny and; myself are strangely puzzled on the account, not from any doubt of Harriet, but from what can give rise to it. I have dispatched a mestage to Mrs. mountney’s to see if they are returned. I will not close this till I have an answer, till which time I shall be in the utmost perplexity. 
I cannot with common patience bear Mrs. Blast. Do not be angry with me,. Lucy; but I cannot help thinking that detraction is almost a female vice: it is true Some men are given to it, but not equally with the women in general. 
I wilh B -- -- -- -1 had half the good qualities

You never saw this queen of Scandal : she visits Lady

circumstance. She has a particular manner of turning up her nosc, and a Supercilious toss with her .head, that gives the story (he is telling the worst appearance. You can now have an idea of her Saying,

I certainly think hallam’s brother must be deceived; but she Says she is Sure that he knows Mrs. Melmoth very well, and pulled, off his hat to her. 1 thought it requisite to inform you of these particulars, that you may, if you please, give her warning of the company into which she is got, as I suppose she cannot know their real characters, (which are very bad indeed) or Ihe would not keep company, with

Madam, 
You that are such a ready censor, and have taken Such liberties with my character, becaiise I brought your brother Such a noble fortune, and chose to Spend a little of it myself, and not let him lavish it all away on a Set of creatures; and in order to avoid his tyranny, and the family impertinence, have sled to a distant country, where I hope to receive more favour than I found from your hands; be pleased to know, dictatorial Madam, that your friend, the pious, the good, the meek, the humble, the virtuous Mrs. Melmoth, has Spirited up Lord Belgrave (another of your family’s favourites) to fight her husband, who now lies dangerously ill at Cambray of a wound which 
Ire has received from that base alsaffin.

My dear Brother,

Scrawl from the abandoned Anne. My father perfectly raved with indignation at the au^cious writer. We had Scarcely Supprested the emotions it occasioned, when a mestenger arrived, his horse ail foaming, with a compliment from the 
Marquis de G -- -- -- -- to beg his Lordship 
to send one of his carriages to the next stage for himself and a lady, and the reason for this request stiould be made 
known on his arrival at V -- -- -- -- --. Both

the Earl and countess had seen this nobleman at Versailles, but were only slightly acquainted with him; therefore this mes fage could not fail of surprising us. a coach and Suitable attendants, however, were Sent; and that evening the Marquis came and presented to us a very agreeable, young lady, who appeared much fatigued: the negligence of her dress, and the languor of her countenance, bespoke a mind ill at ease. A short letter from Lord Belgrave. partly explained the mystery. His Lordship begged my mother to receive the young lady under her protection 
till his arrival at V -- --, which he hoped 
would be in a few a days, x^nd now be pleased to learn, as follows, what occa lloned us this Ijonour : As Lord Belgrave was pursuing his route through French Flanders, in his way to V— — -, a wood near Cambray, he heard the Shrieks of a female in distress. He, with two or three of his attendants, made up to the place from whence. the noise proceeded Two men in maiks, and three or four in liveries, were endeavouring to take the before'mentioned young lady from an old gentleman attended by three servants. The old man defended his' '' charge valiantly, till he was overpovv'ered' by numbers. They were just forcing the young lady into a chaise, when Lord 
Belgrave 
V 
*

• I 
( 217) 
Belgrave came up and retook her; in executing which he wounded the leader of this gang of worse than robbers, whilst his Servants bound the other masked man; for the rest of the Servants, all but one swjss, had decamped.. By this time a company of peasants, going to marketj came up; and the old gentleman being also wounded, by the allistance of those country people he was got into his lord ship’s carriage, which proceeded with him and the lady to Cambray, my Lord himself, on one of his servants horses, escort ing them; the other wounded person, and the before mentioned ' masked prisoner, following in their chaise: : at the entrance of the city they were all taken into custody, by the information of the Servants who had run from the rencounter. 
But the .Marquis de G -- -- -- -- being at his 
castle in the neighbourhood, and lo’d Belgrave being well known to him, he obtained leave for his Lordship to be a prisoner at large in his castle, till the fate of the wounded persons is known. The old gentleman is guardian to this young lady; and, as the Marquis proposed coming to his Lordship for his interest to permit Lord Belgrave to pursue his tour 
to V -- -- --, the lady exprested So much 
terror at the thought of staying in or near the place where the wretches are who 
L would

would have forced her away, that Lord Belgrave proposed, and was Seconded by the Marquis, to entreat her guardian to 
let her accompany him to V -- -- -- -- -- *, and 
remain under our protection, till a proper opportunity offers for her to go with Safety to England. Lord Belgrave, through my father’s mediation, was permitted to come hither last night; and his Lordship, the Marquis, and the Duke de C — i —, ' have given their words for his being forthcoming. 1 would not write till this affair was in some measure determined, 
(I mean, with regard to his lordsliip’s enlargement) lest I stiould keep you too much in fuspence. 
L am Sorry to tell you he is very much indisposed, owing to his extreme fatigue and anxiety of mind. His too feeling heart, that thrills in every vein for Harriet, and for slris recent bustle, has thrown him into a kind of a nervous fever; and ' his physicians have ordered him to be kept very quiet, and by qo means be Suffered to write; for which reason I am deputed his amanuensis; and a wonderful tale I have to tell. — — Could you, without the Spirit of divination, imagine, that the lady under our care is Miss Del Rio, and the wounded russian Melmoth? From these circumstances proceeds poor frederick’s 
arfxiety. Aslisting a lady in distress was 
a natural, 
y 
. T 
( 219) 
a natural, nay, even a godlike act; but that the person he was obliged to encounter should chance to be harriet’s husband, is, as things are Situated, most; unlucky. 
As his Lordfnip is So strictly commanded not to write, you must therefore expect but a broken narrative, in which I must relate as from the young lady’s mouth, and which cannot quite do her justice: because she cannot Speak French So fluent as Spanisli, and I do not understand the latter, consequently it will lose much of that Sweet manner of expression, which accompanies her when she Speaks her native language. She told me. of her parentage, expectations, See. “1 must, Madam, (Said she) make a strange ap pearance to you. Surrounded only with “men; but; when you hear my story, 
“you will find I am an unfortunate, not “a guilty creature. Sir James Hazzel “dine by his Specious manners had gained “Some part of my esteem; nd, young “and unexperienced as I am, had not his designs been providentially dilqck'^ 
“vered, might really have gained a'place “in my affections. I had, during my “residence at Cofway Hall, formed an “acquaintance with a widow lady, one “Mrs. Conway, a most agreeable, sen fible woman; she appeared all sweet ness and good nature, and who is par ‘‘ ticularly sociable with my aunt. Lady

cosway, who Saw her Son with diffe 
“rent eyes from those with which I, or 
perhaps any indifferent person, might 
“behold him, wished, nay, commanded 
“me to receive him as a husband. Sir 
“Marmaduke has neither Sentiment nor 
“delicacy. I would as Icon have met 
“death as Such a husband. Afraid to 
“Speak my Sentiments to my aunt or 
“uncle, and as affliction generally makes 
“people plaintive, I opened my mind to 
“Mrs. Conway. She Soothed me, and 
told me the laws of England would 
not admit of force in Such matters, 
“and that if I could Seem to give into 
“their measures, I might gain time till 
“I was of age, and then 1 might act as 
‘‘I thought proper. This advice, you 
“may suppose, was very pleasing to a 
“young girl, who detested the proposed“ 
“and had a kind of prepof 
“Session for another. My deceased fa“ 
“will, indeed, had Some weight 
“with me; but Mrs. Conway Solved ray 
^^cdpubts, by telling me that she was sure 
mt father would, if living, absolve me 
“from Such a punishment as marrying 
“my cousin, when he kriew his dispo

You may be Sure, Madam, I “co’uld not hear this of a mian not wholly indifferent to me, unmoved; and whilst I was thus debating between duty and “inclination. Sir James came with great “concern to the Hall, and told my aunt “that Sir Marmaduke was run away to ‘‘ Scotland with a young woman by no ** means his equal. Sir James fet out in “pursuit of him. My aunt carried me “to Derby to leave me under Mrs.

We left the “young lady at the School; and in our “return, to our great surprise, we met “Sir James in a Seeming great fright. 
“he told me my cousin was overtaken, 
“and by his mother’s perfuasions brought “back; that my guardian was come “down, and that they were determined“ “marry me to. Sir Marmaduke that “night. I threw myself into Mrs.. Con ‘‘ way’s arms, and begged her to protech “me. She told me, she durst not em“ “herself With persons of such con

When I was the next day ‘‘ a little recovered from the fatigue of “travelling So many miles in a few hours, “although nothing could alleviate the ‘‘ pain of my mind, I was confeious of Something wrong; and yet I was in “Such confusion, that I could not tell whom to blame, whether myself or others.

reasonings as at that time appeared “very plausible. Sir James told me,

“I thanked her in the most grateful “terms, and no longer hesitated to go “on board the vessel; where I found the ‘‘ gentleman who is now left wounded at “Cambray, and whose name I find is “Melmoth, and a young lady, whom “he Said he had brought to attend me. 
I should have told you, Holland was “our place of destination, and pointed “out to me as the only place of Safety “for me. Both Sir james’s Sister and “the young lady Seemed to strive which “Should show me most civilities; yet I “was overwhelmed with confusion to “think what a foolisli runaway I must “appear in the eyes of indifferent peo “pie.

** advice, proceeded from Some intelli “gence brought by a young officer, a “relation of Mrs. conway’s.. Sir James “then,, for the first time, ventured to “declare his astecuon for me. In Short, 
“what with persuafion, and I thought. “the properest step that could then be ‘‘ taken,. I consented to have.himbut, for Some reasons, no clergyman would “perform the ceremony till we were all.

“Saw in its true light the imprudent “step I had. taken; but it was too late 
“toretrao;. Besides I could not Speak a 
“a word of the language; ^ and, fur“ “as I was, except Some persons“ “power appeared in my behalf, it “was a mere impossibility for me to return to England without their consent: : 
“if I proposed it, so many difficulties were pointed out, that I was obliged to acquiesce with them; Sir James, all “this time treating me with the highest “respect. But we hurried about from “town to town, (being pursued, I flip“ “and at length came to a retired “house in a village,, where was an Eng“ “lady of quality.

“me, and often took liberties with me vvhich called my resentment upon him. ‘‘ His Sister was gone to France, where “I was to follow as Soon as I could with “Safety. When they were gone, Sir “James prested me to acknowledge my“ “married to him; that the foolisti ceremony was of little account; that “the search aftcr us (at least the heat of “it) would be over of course; and then “we might Set out for Scotland, and be ' “united according to law, as our minds “were already. guess, my dear Madam, “the horror, the indignation, which I “conceived at Such a proposal; yet I did " “not 'Shevv ray resentment to him, but “slew to the English lady, who (to my “unspeakable Surprise) leconded him.

Where is this same Mrs. B — t, whom you So properly call Mrs. Blaji? Cannot you contrive to Smuggle her to me.? If you could, we wjuld have her ducked in the Danube to wasti away Some of the poison of her tongue, and afterwards send her to work in the mines to purify her ideas; and, if all that did not answer the end then she should go to a rourid tower in the forests of Siberia, and vent her Scandal to the wolves and other beasts of prey that would howl nightly under her window; for their howlirigs^ the voice naturfe has given them, would be preferable to her horrid afpersions on the innocent.

As for Scandal and defamation, those devilish vices can only find room in devilisli minds. It is a certain Sign of an ill heart to be inclined to defamation; they who are harmless and innocent can have no gratification that way: but it ever arises, from a neglect of what is laudable in one’s Self, and an impatience of Seeing it in another; elfe why should beauty and virtue provolce its Severest attacks I

Lord Mulcester to Lady L Temple. 
\ 
I WISH, my Sister, I could obey your commands; but no accounts of your poor friend can I hear, that will give you comfort. Oh! the poor fallen angel I for Surely she as nearly resembled, angels, both in person and mind as anything 
human could do. -- -- -- But let me begin 
where I left off: I went, as I proposed, to’ Newbury, and easiiy found out the house of the Mrs. or miss Spencer. I was without an attendant for prudential ' reasons, which you may guess. I affied for the lady of the mansion, where I Saw a very genteel woman, as to outward appearance. I inquired if Mrs. Melmoth was there t She readily answered, Yes; but she was Sick in bed. I begged ray respecls, and Sent up my name. Saying 
II I wished that I could be permitted to See I her for a few minutes. miss Spencer 
i went up; but returning; she answered, that Mrs. Melmoth was too ill to Speak with any one. “What 1 not to Lord 
“Mulcester?” 
✓ 
{ 237) 
** Mulcester?” (Said I with an emphasis.) “No, Sir, (Said She) not even to you.” I was quite dilconcerted, and directly returned to Newbury. By the way I reasoned With myself: Perhaps (Said I) (he might be fearful it should be Some of melmoth’s emistaries on a feigned pretence. I then wished I had Sent up my name in writing. But, on my arrival at the inn, I inquired more minutely into the character of miss Spencer; when I was informed to my heartfelt grief, that miss Spencer was a discarded mistress of Sir Charles barham’s; and that she had come down and taken that house, and brought with her a young lady who was kept by a French nobleman, and who indeed was mistress of the house more properly, as everything was done by her direction, and all the Servants were at her command; and that she had frequently been there on a market day, and the nobleman with her; that he was very fond of her; and no wonder as she was very handfbme; but that the lady had been very ill. I was afflicled beyond anything you can imagine; for a Sail from virtue, in Such a character as Mrs. melmoth’s, what a triumph to the distolute of both Sexes! — And yet it cannot be: there are So many excellencies in the poor 
fugitive, 
s

^ ( 23 8 ') 
fugitive, that if must be misrepresentation. I am bewildered with thought — the people, are So positive in their alsertions, yet the general tenor of her life is So contrary to those aslertions. But her refusal to See me, the brother of her dearest friend, and one who valued her So much himself, has more weight with me than anything that is Said. Does it imply stie was conscious of Something wrong and did not wish to See me .»* To leave nothing undone, I wrote to her from the inn at Newbury, and returned to town with a heavy heart, having received for answer that she would write to me within a few days. In this matter an indifferent person would be led to conclude that there could be no artifice, as the vtomanacknowledged that Mrs. Melmoth was in the house; a circumstance which, had that lady been detained by force or fraud, it is to be supposed that She would have denied. 
I went the next day to Windsor, where I waited, having left proper directions, and hoping that Mrs. Melmoth might by that time have thought proper to write to 
fme i but was informed that Mr. and Mrs. 
Vareny had Sent three Several meltages for me, entreating to See me. Without changing my riding dress, I waited on them, and was informed that Mrs. Mountney 
, op 
$ 
( 239) 
ney had been there, and in the tenderest terms desired Mrs. Vareny, if Ihe had any regard for the poor fallen Mrs. Melmoth, (as sire termed her) to take her from the hands she was in; saying, that she had treated her with the utmost respedt and tenderness, and, in order to keep her from Melmoth, had been at the pains to change her habitation, and removed to the borders of Hamplhire; but by some accident she became acquainted with a French nobleman, the Duke de R — —, and with him she was gone, under pretence of going to liston to Lord east main : but Mrs. Mountney believes this to be merely pretence, and apprehends they are Somewhere in the neighbourhood of Southampton, and, as the duke’sequi page is So remarkable, thinks we might ' easiiy trace them. She gave this account with tears to Mrs. Vareny, who describes her as a lovely woman. 
We are all unhappy, as you may well suppose; for this intelligence cannot, I think, be doubted. And yet, for So amiable a person to plunge at once headlong into vice, is almost beyond belief. Mrs., Vareny, all goodness as she is, suspends her judgement till farther lights are thrown on this strange affair; but thinks she ought to have Seen me, had she been in the last 
agonies. 
\

agomes. Notwithstanding these obstacles, I Set out once more for Newbury, and Saw the aforesaid miss Spencer, who told me that Mrs. Melmoth was gone from her, and had put herself under the protection of the Duke de R -- -- -- -; but whither 
they were gone was uncertain. She called a Servant, who told' me they proposed going to Portsmouth, and from thence for Lilbon. I must own this gave me a glimpse of hope that Harriet had withdrawn herself from that woman thro’ disgust, and might possibly have put herself under the duke’s protection to conducl her to her brother’s. Saint as this hope was, I crosted the country to rose Mount, and there Saw a Scene of desolation. How unlike the elegant place it once was! A melancholy idea struck me in comparing this beautiful seat, deprived of its greatest beauty, to its once lovely mistress now robbed of her greatest ornament, her 
innocence. -- -- Yet it certainly cannot be. 
— No tidings, however, at this place of Harriet: but Peregrine was gone into the rules of the king’s Bench. From Rose Mount I went to London, and thence to the king’s Bench, thinking perchance stie might have sled to her brother, who now is there: but he had not heard of her 
\ 
Since Ihe left the country, and indeed was 
'so

So stupid with drink, that I could not get a rational answer from him. Thus un successful, I returned home, and there found poor Jenny ready to break her heart; for she had heard those reports. Jenny will by no means listen to them. She Says, She is Sure it is a contrivance of Mr melmoth’s to get her mistress in his power, and that She dares to Say they have put her into a nunnery. I think Jenny in Some respects has judged properly : it is a thought' that neither struck me, nor Mrs. Vareny. And now, my dear Lucy, you must exert yourself to make proper inquiries: the Marquis will aslfist youi How rejoiced shall I be, if you can find her! no matter where, so she is but innocent. Belgrave, if you can help it, must not be made acquainted with it; for, if he hears those dreadful tales, he will be reduced to a state that will deprive him of reason. Unhappy youth! and much more unhappy Hffiriet! whether you are, or are not innocent. But to Providence must I leave the event; and 1 doubt not but you offer up. to Heaven your prayers, with 
Your affectionate brother’s,

In my bed I wrote to Lord Eastmain, and once more entreated him, if he had any regard for his once loved niece, to return with all Speed to England. I have made the best of matters to him : but lawyers, brokers, clave given him a

from being well, Lucy; therefore cannot be So explicit as I could wish. Ask me not why I did not mention Charles: I could not do it with honour to him. He is in the country with Some woman.

Heaven; The honour of our Sex is concerned in harriet’s restoration. Lord? Mulcester has done what man can do; 
. but a female may perhaps have more influence. I would immediately fet out for England!, but that my dear father is again afflicled with the gout, and her Ladyship is extremely ill with the unhappy efsecls of charles’s marriage': they now again wish he had married the meanest creature, if Ihe had but come of honest parentage, and fiad’ been virtuous. Lord Belgrave is also extremely ill. Some oflieious person has informed his Lordship of the reports Spread to Mrs. melmoth’s disadvantage; in consequence of which wear obliged to confine him like a state’prisonerf, butdie is not at all'times / Sensible, and when any restraint is used, it is attributed to his disorder. But here is a new affliction : the amiable Miss Del: Rio is making the most grateful return She can to her deliverer, which is ller heart; she is not confeious of this, although L am Sure of it, and So is Belgrave, who wishes her far from him a hundred times a day. He does not say anything; but like rnyfelf,. his eyes are great tatlers on any occasion wherein the heart is concerned. I cannot, I will not believe my Harriet could Swerve from virtue; but 
suppose 
# '

suppose it possible that a mind like hers Tould not per fist iia i t —; and shall we not receive .a poor, salleti, penitent Sister, who had erred, and wished to return back to the paths of virtue?

Perhaps she is fallen a prey ' to Some brutal wretch, who is Sporting with her calamities: if So, no wonder none of her letters reached me; for I make no doubt but ihe has written; but it is the interest of the creatures who detain her to keep her from all intercourse with her friends.

I would endeavour to See this Duke de

But I am Sorry that I must join with Lord Mulcester in observing. that defamation is a female vice; for, were you to see with what avidity these reports are listened to in the female circles, you would almost wish yourself anything but a woman. Lord B. and his Sister have been warm advocates for Harriet. Lady

you are convinced, is totally abandoned; therefore no wonder if he Should employ his vile agents to blacken and traduce a virtue they could not.overcome. The moment I heard the name of Sir Charles barham’s cast-off mistress, I was certain some horrid invention had been Set on foot to trepan Mrs, Melnroth. I Set Several persons at work, but to no purpose, till I went to Newbury myself: but Miss Spencer would not See me (perhaps guessing that 1 was too well acquainted with their arts); for you cannot conceive, nor does the public know, what villainies aie committed upon innocent creatures drawn 
I into their Snares. At length one of the 
Servants, by a never-failing application, told me he himself knew nothing, but added, .that, if I could find out one Captain Conway,, he might inform me. On this slight information I was determined to return to town, and inquire at 
the

With the utmost delicacy I was capable of, 1 begged to know the cause ot his confinement. He told me he was there for debt, at the Suit of a bad woman, to whom he was not indebted, if the truth could be Searched into. On a little further inquiry I found he was the very Captain Conway I' was in Search of. On my proposal of restoring his liberty, he gave me the following account of himself, which I Submit, Madam, to your judgement; and do not doubt but you will join with me in admiring that Providence, which has brought this black Scene to light, and by the means of one who to common minds might appear so little interested in it.

I was now destitute, except in “jewels and clothes, the former of which “I placed in a banker’s hands, andpr^ ** fended' to Mr. Melmoth, who was “more asliduous than ever, that my fa“ “had disposed of them; for which, “when my transitory mourning was out, “I got a new Set: for, making a merit “of necessity, I Surrendered to him after “a conditional agreement was Signed to “marry me when his uncle died; which “he has Since foundmeans, basely enough, 
to steal from me; although I did not “value his agreement, nor would marry “him if I could : but, from that hour “to’ this, I have accused him of being “my first Seducer, and, artful as he is, “he believes it. You See how open I “am.

mode, when women, of my cast have “accumulated money by means obnox “ious to rebuke in their own country, 
‘‘ to retire to Rome. -- -- -- But, not to in“ 
“on your lordlhip’s patience: — 
“Whilst I was in Paris with Mr. Melmoth, I became acquainted with Lord “Charles Temple, and gained Some con“ “Sums from him, persuading “him I was come to Paris under Mr. 
“melmoth’s protection, to get in Some money due to my father’s estate; a circumstance not to be wondered at, 
“as my father and he were So intimate. 
“From thence I proceeded to Italy with,, “Melmoth; and, he beginning to cool in his affections, I looked round for a “future paramour, and at the carnival “saw Lord Belgrave. I was much struck “with his person; [as what woman is not.? 
“But hearing his general character for “morality, and Such stuff, I knew I must “wear the malk of virtue and exemplary “goodness to attract him; and, could I “once gain his notice, I thought my “point gained: for which reason I quar “relied with Melmoth, and quitted him “at Mantua. I dressed rnyfelf as a “widow, and, by a manoeuvre, not only attracted his notice, but the Sagacious “Lord mulcester’s also. I was not with

out hopes that I might be Lady Bel“ “if I could once fascinate him So far as to attempt my honour: I was “then Sure, from his jdrinciples, I should“ “him. But you shall hear how I “was foiled: I went to England elate with hope : I took a little cottage, and “adorned it in a most romantic taste“ 
“it with the best authors, anci everything calculated to please such a ‘‘ mind as Lord belgrave’s. In this place I first Saw miss Villars, now Mrs. Mel“ “She was diarmed with my little “elegant retreat, and wished an acquaint“ “with the miftress of it; a Sure “Sign of Succefg, I thought, if she ap“ “my person and manners : and I would have cultivated her acquaint ance, as the notice of a person of her rank and character 'might have been of “great Service to me in my design on ‘‘ Lord Belgrave; but was obliged to decline it, lest, on nearer interviews, 
“she should perceive what I then wished“ “conceal. I thought her, as miss “Villars, a Sweet creature, and disliked “her for nothing but for being more virtuous and innocent than myself: but, when I heard she was married to Melmoth, altho’ I despised the man, 
“I could not bear she should bear his

name, and See her flourlsli away at “court, at the play. See. whilst I was “obliged to keep Such an humble di stance. But, when I found it was her “cursed charms that deprived me of “Belgrave, I vowed revenge; for which “reason I joined more heartily with Melmoth in all his Schemes, and got ‘‘ her into my power, and make no doubt “but I stiould have humbled her, had it not been for that officious apostate, “Tom Conway. But, to do her justice, “She behaved becoming the charaffer Ihe “assumed— — obstinate, and very vir“ “; for nothing but force could have “prevailed with her, although I believe “the Duke would have married her, had “stie been at liberty, he vas So infatuated “with her. And yet I see nothing So 
“very extraordinary in her -- -- -- A baby 
‘‘ say— — life, no airs. Had she not “got off as stie did, not all her virtue “could have Saved her, Melmoth being “determined to be divorced from her, “but for a trick, which I did not know “till last week, that Sir James and his “crew have Served me. I will let you “into all their Schemes. As for Tom “Conway, he Should not have betrayed “us; for I have Supported him these “three years past : nor indeed stiould I

( z6t) 
have arrested him but from revenge. 
‘‘ The Duke de R -- -- -- -- is raving for the 
“loss of Ms Harriet, as he called her. 
It is amazing to me where she can be “concealed; for I stopped all her letters to Lady Lucy, except one, which was “forwarcied from Mrs. mountney’s “(whom I suppose you guess to be your humble Servant) : indeed, once I was “so kind as to write or Lady Lucy, “and forbid her the trouble of a cor respondence, as I (Lady Lucy) did not choose, after her imprudent conducf, “to have any correspondence with her. “And now, my Lord, I have told you “the whole truth. If I can Serve Mrs. 
Melmoth, I will; not from love, as “I told you before, but from revenge. Nor do you have a better opinion of Conway than you have of me : for it ‘‘ certainly cannot be virtue for virtue’s, “Sake, which has induced him to this; “but love for Del Rio, or some Such “motive. However, I will perform my promise: if I can get clear of this “vexatious affair, I will put my money H “into the bank of Holland, and retire “to Rome.” 
Thus,, Madam, this strange creature ended her narrative. Such a mixture of .■good sense and impiety I never, in the 
course

course of my connexions widi man or woman, met with. How much is it to be regetted, that Such an education, and ^ Such talents, Should be So much abused! and become now her punishment and curse, when they might have been a blessing I I hope she will keep her resolution of going to Rome, that England may be quit of Such an intriguing Spirit. 
She difmisted the aclion against Conway at the first word. I expect him in. town this evening. Mrs. melmoth’s trunks,, she left at spencer’s, were, by isabella’s direction, brought to Lord mulcester’s last night. His Lordship has undertaken’ to Settle matters with Sir Charles,, that these w’^omen may be Suffered to quit the country. I purpose to send Captain Conway in Search of Mrs. Melmoth. I will keep a mestenger in waiting, on purpose to Send the first moment I have the happiness to hear of her. I hope. Madam, you will approve of what I have done:

And now, altho’ last, yet not the least thought of, I Speak of " Lord b.’s goodness, in the pains he has taken, and continues to take, on my friend’s account. Tell him how much I think myself obliged to him, and that I approve of every step he has taken.

But there are two Sorts of persons, you know, the judicious few, and the. precipitate many. According to the ideas of the latter, I must accept a challenge, or Suffer an opprobrious name: but, as I never will knowingly lift my hand against the divine harriet’s husband, I therefore think it best to keep out of his way.

He Sent his sv.'iss Servant with an answer to his Lordship, importing that his lady died at Granville, where she had gone in pursuit of Mr. Melmoth The swiss also confirmed it, and that his master was extremely astecled.at her death.

Poor miss Del Rio!, how much is that young lady to be pitied I but I hope: the lenient hand of time, [which is the Softener of Sorrow, and pacifier of woe] as she ijs yet but young, will do much for her: t — and yet I do not think Belgrave ought to remain under one roof with her. The poet Says, that. 
— Time and absence you will find to “prove 
A Sure success for unsuccefsful love.” 
I am extremely concerned for frederick’s declining health; and yet I dare not wisti him to come to England, lest Melmoth should challenge, or perhaps even get him affiaffinated. I wish yoir would persuade him to go to the Spa, and. keep Lady cosway Some time with you.

Thus to be cut off in all the bloom cf youth and beauty, a fallen blostom gathered as a trophy to perfidy and cruelty! Do not. Madam, let Lord Belgrave know this: 
I have a reason for it; or, at least let my Sister difclose it to him, when her own Sorrow is a little moderated. Lord East' ' does not know it yet : he went to Eastmain yesterday to receive the Marquis for a few days. Sir Charles, Lady cosway, and Mils Del Rio, Sent' their Several compliments yesterday, to acquaint me vviih their arrival: but the woeful account from Granville deprived me of the power of waiting on them last night. I lent this morning but too weighty a reason 
for it. Lord B -- -- is gone to his estate

I not only have been the means of clearing Mrs. Melmoth from the vile afpersions, but have likewise discovered Ihe is in being; which you shall know by the soli lowing relation. As soon as Lord east main went to town on your Summons, j Lord Charles and the Marquis Set out for Gloucestersliire; but, on the way, Charles prevailed on him to call on Sir Alexander Nelbit, on the borders of our county, j Sir i\.lexander is very hospitable, and j loves convivial friends. The Marquis was pleased with his reception, and the ' 
beautiful

beautiful Situation of Neslbit wood; therefore they took up their residence with him for Some days. But one morning the Marquis, being an early riser, attended only by his valet. Sallied forth on horseback (very Imprudent, you will sty, when neither of them could Speak Englisli) : they rode on till they came to the forest; where a deer rusliing hastily from a thicket, the Marquis's horse took fright, and ran away with him. He kept his Seat for Some time; but, finding no hopes of the creature’s stopping, he threw himself off, and thereby broke his leg and dislocated his slioulder. In this condition he was carried by Some poor haymakers to the. next village, where there is a tolerable inn; and a man was dispatched to the next town, at four miles distance, for a surgeon. In the mean time the poor distrested Marquis, impatient of being amidst strangers, who could not understand one word of what he Said, made Signs for Some person to write a letter, but in vain, till a neighbouring lady was so kind to come and converse Some time with him, and by her means a note was dispatched to Mr. Temple, who immediately came away with Sir Alexander; for the Servant was not then returned with the news. He was gone twenty miles another way, mistaking the road, in Search 
of

of his master. Mr. Temple Sent away post for me. I luckily was at home, and Set out with the mestenger. When 1 Arrived, I found the Surgeons had just Set the fractures : they altured me the Marquis was in a fair way, if he were kept quiet. You know. Sir, Mr. Temple is not fond of Solitude; therefore, as soon as he could with decency, he left the Marquis to my care; and then I had time to contemplate the melancholy contents of your packet to me to inform me of Mrs. melmotli’s death. In the midst of my grief on that account, the Marquis, finding himself much easier, and able to converse, told me how much he was obliged to the lady who So humanely came to him. In ail his life, he Said, he never Saw a more beautiful creature, or one in whom Such dignity and sweetness ' were mingled, whilst she Spoke to him: but, when, she heard the name of Temple, Ihe trembled, turned pale, and went to the window; but, immediately recollecting herself, took a hasty leave, and Said she would take care a note stiould be Sent to Sir alexander’s; which you know She punctually performed. A thousand pleas ing hopes at once darted into my head. 
I had heard of fictitious births and deaths.

by a salse tale: I will endeavour to find out who this lady is. I inquired of the people of the inn; of whom I learned, that the lady came thither about three months Since, and took a Small house in the village, where Ihe Set up a School,, and was beloved by all the neighbours; that Madam Melville, a neighbouring gentlewoman, and lady of the manor, came to her Seat for the Summer season, and, in her visits to the village, called in at the School, and was So pleased with Mrs. Bladon, the school miftress, that Ihe had taken her to live with her ever since;; when the Marquis came, they not understanding what he Said, knew that Mrs. Bladon could “talk alh outlandijb ". “languages, ” (the innkeeper’s word); he had gone to her who immediately came in Madam melville’s charriot. I new drested myseif, and Sent to Sir alexander’s for his coach, and waited on Mrs. Melville; a fine, graceful lady, goodness and benignity painted in her face. I begged leave to See Mrs. Bladon. 
By the hesitating answer Mrs. Melville gave, I was encouraged to Say, “Do not,

I remember you once Said,, that it was more difficult for a man to behave well in prosperity than in adversity: but the man who will prove the observation to be true, must not be one who,, by his own. extravagance or vice,, has reduced himself, from an affluence to which he was born, to penury; at least, to a state of obligation and dependence. — But let me forbear reffections on this dying libertine. Lord. Eastmain would have had him removed to Hanover square; but his physician advised to the contrary.

Where could the dear, romantic creature get so much penetrationbut how barp fighted is a woman in love! The result of all is, that she is going to retire to a convent, and there lament her hapless flame. When she is fettled in her choice. of what I call a living tomb, she is to take leave of Lord Belgrave in a pathetic epistle, and to write another to Harriet to persuade her to accept the amiable

but poor consolation. However, it may be proper to inform you, that by my lifter’s last packet I find that, your last visit to that lady having given occasion to the talkers to blaze abroad an account that a treaty of marriage was concluded ^ between you, the lovely, injured Harriet was traduced in all companies on this account. This, like the rest of her sufferings, She bore with a saintlike patience, till, your departure being known, the report was contradicted — — It is well, 
“(said she then, lifting her fine eyes to “heaven) this is the last: of my trials. — 
“Amiable youth! — the world no more “shall persecute us: for we must now “remain, and it is fit wfe niould, ' where “mountains, Leas, and deserts must di vide us.” 
The pearly drop stood in her eyes while she spoke thus — “Forgive my weakness“ 
“she) but this is the last tribute “I iball pay to the memory of my de parted happiness— — said more: but, as this is the sum of all, here I stop. — 1 lliall only add, that Lord east main, who has fettled all his estate upon his amiable niece, has rnade her a present of a little rural retreat, about ten miles 
distant from Eastmain; whither stie is
