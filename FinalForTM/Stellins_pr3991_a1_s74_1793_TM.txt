WE do not pretend, by giving the title of “The New Werter” to the following sheets, to put the work upon a footing with its excellent model. — The Compiler of the letters left the choice of a name to us, and that which we have adopted appear’d preferable to any other. 
It is, perhaps, needless to observe, that the Subject of the

on real facts,, — the fon of the Abbe yerufalerrij a celebrated Itheologian^ at Brunfwtch^ being the unhappy vlsilm of a pajjion inspired by a lady of jvet%lar, Our history, too, is no romance.' — But to avoid repetition, we refer the reader, for further particulars to the subjoined letter, which came to our hands with the manuscript.

The EDITOR. 
( 
Rome, Dec. 8, 1790. 
I Send you a manuscript, which Mr. G. G. our common friend com mishoned me to put into your hands on his departure from London. — It is his wish that it should be published in France, and under your inspedtion.

And now I have fulfilled my commission, let me add a Sew particulars in explanation of the work. Mr. G. G. compiled the letters after his return from the Istand of Sicily. — When 
4 
r 
he had completed the tour of that fine country, and was preparing to return to Rome, chance introduced him to the acquaintance of a young man of • the city of Palermo, with whom he quickly contracted a most tender and lasting friendship— — circumstance 
r 
detained him there, and it was not still after his friend’s departure from Palermo, in pursuit of a woman he adored, and who was going to England, that he himself went from thence and rejoined me at Rome. — He left me Soon after, in Spite of my 
entreaties, 
* 
C ] 
, entreaties, and retired to an agreeable Solitude at Tivoli. 
It was in this retreat that he Secretly traced the fatal progress of the passion that led astray his absent friend. — He rarely came to Rome — Unhappy from Suffering friendship, the vivacity of his disposttioii left him, and he entirely abandoned his accustomed pursuits and occupations. He mourned the fate of a youth who was possessed of stronger feelings than the generality of mankind, torn away from him by a dangerous and fatal attachment, — engaged in the pursuit of a woman, the wife of a rich and powerful man, and in a country, Too, where the manners of its inhabitants 
i 
» 
[ VI ] 
bitants are less corrupted than in the rest of Europe; and where the laws incessantly watch over the honour of every one; — where the weak are protected and the injured redressed— — contemplated with dread the abyss which the ssightest attempt to violate these laws might open to the unwary Sootsteps of his friend; and Secretly regretted that he had nothing but vain and unavailing counsels to offer him. He anticipated the > Satal consequence of his pursuits, and aster the melancholy catastrophe had happened, he took upon himsels the mournsul talk osstrewing Some flowers upon his friend’s grave, by thus collecting all his letters and forming them into an exact Series of events. 
Such 
/ 
[ VII ] 
Such has been the motive of this publication, and Surely a more ate feding motive can Scarcely be conceived. 
\ 
'But tho’, like Achilles, he wished to eternise his Sorrow, yet he preserved 
r 
all that respect which was due to the memory of his friend, and concealed his name under that of the title of the work, and his own under that of Fabius. Yet in Spite of these precautions, there are few people in this part of the world, but who, upon the perusal of the book will easily recognise the name and the unhappy end of the young Palerinian. 
T 
% 
[ VIII ] 
I, myself, knew this young man, and have osten heard him Speak of the acquaintance he had made at Palermo with the English lady in question, and not at Vemce, as appears by the letters. The compiler has probably thus changed the Scene of their first interview, the better to Savour the mystery in which he wifired to envelope the name and story of his friend.

This park is one of the most agreeable walks I ever Saw. — It lies at the western extremity of the city, and is a place of very conssderable extent; equally commodius for carriages as for people on Soot, and is a place of sash ionabl e resort.

After walking about for Some time I came near a fine garden. Separated from the park by a ditch and parapet wall — 
1 at length came to a Small door, which I found half open; a poor man stood near it, and Seemed to be begging alms. I gave him a piece of money — and from him I learned that the place the door led into was called Kensington Gardens, and that the public were allowed to walk there. — I received a thousand benedidions from the beggar, and was much astonished at the gratesul acknowledgements he expressed for Such a trifle. — It was with Secret pain that I constdered the Surprise that a poor man Selt at having touched the compassion of a rich one; — and from this incident I began to 
conceive

Absorbed in refiedions arissng from the Subject besore me, I insensibly strolled into one of the most retired walks of the garden; — it was composed of lofty trees and beautiful underwood, and afforded a Scene highly congenial with my penssve turn of mind. — As I was coming back towards the place where I had entered, I perceived a glove on the ground; I took it up, and looked around to See if I could find out to whom it belonged, — and I Saw a lady coming towards the Spot, and looking about as if she had dropped Something. I walked up to her, and accosting her, presented the glove.

She could not conceal her feelings * nor hide her blushes as she looked at me, and listened with great condescenston to the passionate words I was uttering, which my love didlated, but which my faltering lips could hardly pronounce. — What did I Say to her? indeed I know not! — for Surely I cannot now recolleds, what I knew So little about even while I was Saying it.

Happily the appearance of a new vi sttor turned the attention of the company from my embarrastrnentj and relieved me from a sttuation equally distreffing to myself and to Lady Petershy.

This ancient custom, ridiculous as it is, prevails all over England, especially among the better Sort of people; — and the best excuse that can be al ledged for it is, that it Serves todiffipate the ennui of those who have nothing else to do, and who want Something to fill up the irksomeness of time, and to relieve the apathy of their minds.

I Sat down at the foot of the tomb, in the midst of the shrubs that o row 
O 
around it, and with my face turned towards the epitaph. So simple, and yet So affecting, that stops for a moment the steps of the traveller of senfi bility, and makes him give a tear to the memory of the fair Cecilia. — My

Her teeth were beautiful, and her month was as fresh as though water she had just lipped. Without knowing what I was about, I chose the part of the cup her lips had touched. — I was tempted to take her for the nymph of the Source. — Her noble and simple air, and Something divine she had

1 
they degenerate into inutility, folly, or affectation. Now I am of opinion that modern typography partakes much of these three qualities; and I assure you that if I shad any chance of leaving a work behind me, from which I could expect celebrity, I would not Suffer it to be published, but on the express condition, that it should not be entrusted to any of, our modern Elzevirs.

Solution as a crime in the eyes of the being to whom I owe my existence. There is no absurdity, no bad reason, no salse principle that may not be desended by the help of captious and Sophistical logic; and this is So true, that one would almost be tempted to doubt whether the first man ever tasted of the mysterious tree of knowledge of good and evil. So uncertain ■»
