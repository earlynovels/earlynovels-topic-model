can never subsist, when put in competition with that grand principle which dirests this necessary point of our existence, nature; and indeed if any human law militates against nature, it no longer claims obedience. Marriage is but a political establishment, formed to perpetuate estates, or
legitimise children; Loth of which may be effested by Subsequent methods, without a previous ceremony. Marriage in itself requires no ceremony. I conceive, then, an union, founded on reason and nature, poffi ■ ble without the unmeaning and almost always unreguarded forms in use, and without complying with the restraints
of
2b a b s t r a C t.
of modern laws. Or shppofing shell a fublcript'ion To the existing forms, where is the utility of a form that ceases to be observed? Does not the union I have imagined, unaccompanied with the Solemnity of an oath in the presence of the Supreme Being, pre -- vent the most abominable of perjuries; or admitting (as Some' would argue)
Such an union to be criminal in she eyes of man, of two evils, the lesser
should be uhosen; the offending Society, by rejesting its rules, cannot be so enormous as the offending both God and man by the commission of .adultery, which induces perjury to both.

It depends neither upon persons, circumstances, time, nor place; it is a mere ast of the will, and may be

MR.  TO THE REV.
JEREMY GENTLE.
t
Ecclesiastical thunder, my
worthy and pious friend, has ceased to roar, or if it does, it only terrifies
Superstitious matrons or timid children. The present era of intellestual improvement demands Something more
E 2 Sub
52 ABSTRACT
Substantial than declamation for argument, or dry Scholastic rules for the more persuastve eloquence of prastical life : however I may applaud your humanity in relieving the distresses of •my angel, and your benevolence in. instilling into her mind those precepts which have So eminently distinguished you as the divine and the man of letters, I regret your relying upon those particulars, as an authority to deter me from being ecjually as humane and charitable : my soul expands at beholding the miseries of the unfortunate as well as thine, and my abilities to afford them Succour are more than commenlurate to thy pittance,
  53
tance, and therefore the greater the obligation on my part. What! Shall it be reported that a man enjoying my revenues. Surrounded with every convenience and luxury, is behind hand
in comforting the fatherless, - the poor Annette? From this period, your parental care and maintenance may be withdrawn, that charge devolves upon me in a double capacity, as her protestor and passionate admirer. I adore her unsuspicious gentle heart, unprastised and estranged by guile, the refined purity of her soul, and disdain, as much as yourself, the very idea of her Swerving from that virtue
0
which you have So studiousty and
E 3 Sue
54
Successfully inculcated. Did file net regard my principles, in this favourable light, the very foundation of our union would be Sapped and destroyed: reciprocal honour and esteerti must stiblist between us; I must be as constant,, as uncorrupt as herself; I alone
*
must be the objest of her affestion, as file of mine. Indeed, the vital existence of our connexion, is perfest love and perfect: virtue. Is this that sordid, vicious state So Shamefully applauded and Speedily adopted by fashionable 'and dishp'ated individuals? Is there no disagreement? are not interest, vanity, or an abominable, thirst of riches, the predominant motive of
thole
  gg
those abandoned women who enter into that deluding path? Is not the
gratification of sensual desires, or a
0
temporary Sacrifice to the wicked manners of a wicked age, the general inducement to men If Such are not,, and I disclaim the cruel thought, the causes influencing my System, how can they possibly produce the Same ruinous consequences unavoidably attendant upon concubinage? With us, all is harmony and tranquil felicity, uninterrupted by the jarring contentions of matrimony, or the criminal and expensive glare of an in ■ Satiate mistress.

The W eakness of your argument.
with regard to my agshn venturing upon the matrimonial journey, needs no refutation; if having oncet escapedt, an evil, I obstinately expose myself to the same, where is my boasted reason ^
the moral beauty of my choice you cannot but admire; at the Same time you will acquiesce, I have no doubt;, in my determinations to pursue those measures immediately conducive to
V
(
my deiigns.
I will now disclose to you my movements. The cloud which en veloped the knowledge of annette’s parentage and extrastion, as it had
5 involved
A B S T R A C T.. 57
involved you in perplexity and con jestures, animated me with the plea stng hope of penetrating its obscurity, and of revealing Some Small ray of light, which in all probability might .lead to a, discovery. I returned to launcelot’s cottage, for my impatience was not to be controlled. The decripit. silver headed old man received me with his accustomed ehearfulness; he attempted to rise, and bowing respestsully, drew a chair
for me near the fire; being Seated,, my eager eyes inquired for Annette, .-
“My daughter is in the garden.
Sir, ’’

5’S
I forget my answer. I was grieved at her absence, although Ihe herself was not the Sole objest I willed to
meet. Glad of the opportunity to find Lancelot, I hastily proceeded to execute the purport of my errand.
“Well, Lancelot, how is it with you these hard times ?”
“Thank heaven, your honour. i’m now pretty well off, but i’ve been in a mortal poor Condition;. had it not been for Providence, Anne and I must have starved. This day, your honour, has turned out a rare day; I knew Some good luck would come, by the cackling of our hens. Why, Sir, a

\
In this instance I trace the charl table hand of my friend, that hand which has So warmly and So strenu ousty supported the tottering fabric of Lancelot. “And pray who Sent it ?’*'
I replied.
He Seemed staggered at the ques tion; I conjecture that it never occur

“Come, friend, I know all, was it not Mr. Gentle? Has he not ashfted ^ you and your daughter, as you call
her?’»'
i
“Lord, Sir !i (he interrupted me with a deep groan) and who’d have thought it !^^
A
Upon this I questioned' him still, more strongly. His story coincided with yours in every respest, excepting in this addition, that the phystcian. reported his wife to have died delirious. That information entirely allayed my curiosity, and I only lamented’
  k1

.been baffled, and his humanity imposed
upon. She is Still the hapless Annette, the daughter of Lancelot
: the cottager. Alas 1 why not the bosom .friend of her Abllrast?
After a familiar conversation, I left him with the agreeable prolpest of .ending his days in peace and comfort, independent of the world and its terrific frowns. I have Settled upon himself and child an annuity more than Sufficient for their wants, and shave ordered my Steward to prepare
for their reception a Small untenanted shouse I possess on the Seashore. Its

THE SAME TO THE SAME.
Serene and lovely was the even

woods with a glowing yellow; the

wide expanse of waters was cairn and

Sfilent: what were my emotions at Such a Scene! you know how enthustasti f caily d admire The glories of the creation, how much a magnificent or beautiful iandscape, a riling or a Setting Sun, transports my imagination.; and to behold Annette at Such a Sea son, in Such a place, it vras too much.
precipitated myself besore her; her alarm at Seeing me lo unexpededly was excessive, .and I trembied for her sasety; the terror and confusion into which I had inadvertently thrown her, was Succeeded by a plentisul fiiower of tears, which Subsided into the most; inexpressible languor, at once captivating
  65
ting the senses, and rushing to the heart.
You will not condemn me, when I inform you that I gently locked her arm in mine; it was the impulse of the moment, and to have neglected it, would have been a breach of polite ness, and a want of comoashon. We

proceeded Ilowly along; her countenance averted from me, and I rap turousty gazing upon her charms, and fortune would have it So, the wind ino; of the shore directed us near to

the identical Spot destined for her future residence. She complained of fatigue, and arm in arm we rested VOL. I. F our

ourselves upon a stony Seat, which had been excavated by the foaming billows. I felt inspired; the rocks of Meillerie, the love, the despair of a St. Prieux occurred to my distempered brain; but no mistress was present to share or Solace his Sufferings: he was a Solitary, insulated being; his sighs and lamentations were as loud and as airy as the winds that whistled round his rugged cavern. My charmer is near me, I press her warm, her tender hand; I am Sensible of a kind, a gentle return; my heart beats in unison to the repeated pressure : It is not fancy? I awake from this ex tatic reverie, and tremulousty exclaim,

would have Supported an infirm and

indigent old man and his child but yourself.”

Gratitude choked her utterance.. I stood convicted of the innocent deceit I pradised upon you, my friend, in persuading Lancelot that you was
the author of the gratuity.

“Hear me, ” resumed Annette, judge me not incapable of the Softer feelings of humanity; I Ice the wretchedness into which an unhappy

Suffer no diminution; the duty you owe to yourself is Superior to all others. Was your father So inhuman, was Society So tyrannical, as to order you to destroy yourself, would you do it? certainly not; your own life is preferable to the claims of the one or the other; • or coolly and deliberately to be the death of a fellow-creature, humanity revolts at So fiiocking a Spectacle. And will you, then, in order to Subscribe to the local customs of our country, remain yourself for ever single and unproteded, and cruelly

“I am convinced of that, (replied my pretty opponent) but is not
that State which you formerly proposed to me, contrary both to nature and religion ?”
“Far otherwise, it is' consonant toi each of them, as each of them enjoin it. Marriage is merely natural and Divine law, circumscribed by par

Our arrival at her intended mansion put an end to the dilcourse : we entered, and I was pleased to find the

It lies embosomed in wood and copse, Separated frgm the channel only by a gradual declivity, which is bounded by a ridge of tufted cliffs, extending as far as the eye can discern, excepting the narrow path we took, there is

Imprimis, you must absolutely lay assde your foible of disputation, nor endeavour to pervert your mental faculties to the purposes of immiorality or indecency; you must faithfully represent fasts, and avoid all simulation and dissembling; and if ever I find you excussng your duty under the veil of false reason, I dilmiss you. Again, you are to assume the charaster and appearance of a gentleman without its frivolity ^ and expenssveness, not tl'.at I intend limiting you, as that would Srustrate everything, but I request you will not be profuse. Upon your first appearance, pretend yourself ol muen urater fortune and consequence

always prove a letter of recommen

After a certain period, the termi

nation of which I leave to your dis posal, you are to introduce yourself to
your Suture mistress, either by bribery, or by your own address; you are to make known the artifice, deliver my letter, and entreat her to Send me an answer; if She is obstinate, and perk

well for that too. You mention at the winding up of your letter, how force has been used to trap miss annette — you’re right,, your honour, - — and how I must use force to regain her — right again, your honour; and you may trust me with anything.. As for those parsons, I always hated them, they tyrannical over people So, and it is a shame that parliament should Suffer a fat bishop to have
twenty thousand a year,, and allow a poor labouring curate, who is no more

than a Servant like myself,. to possess only enough to keep him in victuals and drink. Ah 1 your honour,. I airi
Sorely grieved that you started the
Subjest;
138
fubjest of drunkenness, and to throw out that I vras given to liquor: upon the honour of a gentleman, it is no Such thing; I confess I notv and then cheer mvfels Vvhth a p; lass when affairs go wrong, and should I unmeaningly

get toxicated and kick up a row, its none of my fault: I reason thus — if I am sober, that is, have my senses about me, I commit no error; when I am cut, I always do Something amiss; but what makes me do amiss? wine to be Sure — it is the wine, then,, not myself, that errs, or, as our old. friend the player has it, “that Steals

Well, I had been here but a little while, when I began to Set about discovering my mistress, and they told me there was a peaking club open
to
that evening, and there were many ladies to be present; I dressed myself

was, — but no matter — no Annette made her appearance, and I returned
to my .tavern: as luck would have it,

144 A B S T R A fc T.
just as I came up, I Saw parson Gentle, I turned my heels dii him, and bade my Scoundrel of a footman follow me, and after a little parley he agreed to shodge the old fox home; he brought •me word of his having Seen the paishn

was the answer. “Is your lady nt home ?” the maid hesttated — silence gives consent, thought I, and So, without any ceremony, I hopp’d into i the chamber where miss was sitting;
ilie did not know me, and indeed her
olast

I know not how it was, I felt glad to •go, and was Soon out of sight; the paper contained as you See, “Be at

That I actually gave a hop on the occasion.

You miay now. Sir, be easy, and give yourself no more anxiety about sher, I am Sure she loves you, for she blushed and shook as tho’ I was a ” : ghost:, and force is unnccesstry.
One melancholy circumstance Seems To cloud over this lucky issue — I want • cash,, your honour, and can only plead ’4he awkwardness of my borrowed ■plumes, and the 'utter impossibility vof Supporting the charaster of a man

discumbered of the pressing weight of a guilty conscience, I can freely impart to you the object of its continual up braidings, the Secret stimulus of a passion which rather resembled the paroxifms of a madman, than the mournsul Sorrows of a tender admirer. It was the delusion of reason (Satal as at ever has been to me) which inssuenced my conduct, and which ever will, until I am forced by calamities inseparable from humanity, or by arguments •more cogent and lest poisonous than
‘ my destrudive principles, to retrad
%
all, and to regain the common well beaten path; but 1 know not how it was, I considered myself as environed
by

shy prejudices the instant I could distinguish between right and vttong, happiness and misery; my education,
“Of So great consequence to the growing man, conssfted of a barren Superfluity of words and languages, whilsc I neglected the more momentous study of myself and man. Was I in fault? The authority of my preceptor, conjoined to an affected gravity, told me 1 was, and only that I was faulty, with -- out any reason. It was Sufficient for him to command, and for me to obey;
and yet this very teacher of youth would often commit the very Sault for which his pupils had been reproved, What were my inferences? if he has
O 2 done
I
ipb ABSTRACT
done with impunity what I was blamed, and perhaps punished for
doing, it cannot be criminal, or else L e must; be a profligate and cruel master. Believe me, however, he vas accounted no Such character; and had he been as I have represented him, •that defect was abundantly compensated by his learning and abilities.; .and thus for the Sake of attaining a Scanty knowledge of obsolete anti equity, (of little or no utility in life) my morals were nearly destroyed, and I learned the Solly of beginning by dull precepts instead of by matters of and illustration; had he first shown me the consequences of my Sault in a. 4 living
  197
living example, I must have been notoriously stupid not to have comprehended the force of his instrudion, and would have avoided the com mishon of it as a certain and terrible evil; had he been cautious of his own demeanour, I might have been tempted from a Supposstion of his wisdom to confide in him, and irjght have many
years yet to experience that the world
«
frequently condemns whati it as frequently pradises. This, my Annette, was my private education, and you will at once declare my time had been mispent in acquiring what the generality of children must undergo or be despised, and that I had better have

as in my time. Well stocked with Roman and Grecian literature, and'

not a little elated at the transporting ideas of emancipating from the Setters, of pedagogueism, I at last commenced

or interest;) vere the most conspicuous amongst my juvenile competitors, and not unfrequently were the admiration of the neighbouring gentry; my table was the resort of the epicure and the
voluptuous, and as far as college rules
would admit, of the noisy conceited Frenchman, and the quiet mian of
four bottles. With these companions,,
and with these attractions, my acquaintance became universally courted from the rubicund graduate, down to the most inssgnistcant commoner, all were obeisant to my nod; the tradesmen of the town were the politest imaginable, and anticipated my wants,

young, man not arrived at years of discretion, my senses were intoxicated, and. for Some terms Oxford was the only place capable of bestowing pleat Sure to a mind as yet incurious of phi? loshphy,, and regardless of the. censure or approbation of the good and will The period was not yet arrived, when tlioughtlcss extravagance and frivolous

or to the rational entertainment of a circle of learned and agreeable friends.
Alas! I was destined for Severe trials before that, event took place; I had

This difference of treatment struck me

forcibly: vain were my reproofs; they were answered with surprise or ridicule, and the good-humour and facetiousness of the tutor Soon banifii ed the keen refiedions of his protege.' in vice and debauchery. So rapid,

indeed, was my progress in the ac eomplilbment of an universtty buck,, that at the expiration of the time usually allotted for the obtaining a degree, I found myself incapable of rest

Their demand was complied with,, and I was upon the point of bidding adieu to college ale and extravagance,, had not the creditors of a friend,, whom I had affiflied, prevented my departure; he,, witty gentleman, had...

I Rene w my relation at a period the
most critical, and perhaps the most unfortunate and disgraceful in my whole existence. Notwithstanding my acquisttions in modern dialests,
and my supposed improvement in
the
S T R A C T. vcli
: the volume of the world, which I • thought might have advanced me into the Society of the higher circles, I was driven by ..an irrelistible fatality into the company of gamesters and liber • tines. I never had a propensity to gaming;
the thought of hazarding every j^resent and future enjoyment upon
, .the casual throw of a dice, appeared .To me, to be truly unworthy a reasonable creature. So that till this direful moment, I had resisted it with manly Sortitude. .Now, alas! .1 was doomied to unnerve at once that strength of mind which had withstood the allurements of an indolent collegetlife, or
.the assaults of a vicious beau.monde,

or a S], )endthrift foreigner. I played
ft
deep, and at first was wonderfully
ft
successful; my friends, as they called themselves, applauded my Sagacity,
and attributed to my ability, what in fast was the effests of Sortune. A little elated, though not a little sus picious, I ventured to engage with a party of the most notorious Swindlers in town, and, in the end, found myself steeced and palpably cheated. Remonstrance V as in vain; nay, my life was in danger, and I retired, covered with the sarcasms and execrations of the most abominable villains that ever dishonoured human nature. And yet, my Annette, there are men of

honour, endowed with all the refinements of a liberal education, men placed on the lofty eminence of popularity and power, who Sacrifice the time they Snould dedicate to the Service of their friends, or to the public welfare,, to this paltry resource of pleasure or emolument. Such a dispo fition of mind often generates deeply felt and regretted embarrastrnents;. and I learned by experience to shun its Syren voice.

Affairs in France had then takeir that decisive turn in favour of repub licanism; which has So peculiarly dis -- tinguilhed them; and the notions' of total emancipation, without any regard to time, circumstances and place, were eagerly embraced, and rapidly promulgated throughout the colony of St... Domingo., To the astonifiiment of every one, Valois became a partial convert to the new philosophy, and fstoke publicly of its utility, and concluded with wishing its success. There is no reshlving the motives of men; Valois, blind -

to his own interest;, constantly combated his ancient principles, which

A
her dignified conceptions of religion
and morality, won my reason; but as I then little imagined, not my heart.
She appeared to me in the light of a female philosopher; had Studied Locke; was well versed in newton’s principia, and aigued Syllogiftically; and to Such a being as myself, I concluded She might prove a very eligible companion. The lady was at her own disposal, and nothing but the ap 2 rrobation

probation of Sir Humphry, Seemed
requisite to complete the, happy celebration. An hereditary invalid, he had always the predelection for gentlemen of the faculty, and most heartily recommended to his sister, the Selection of one of their members, as a partner for life. Charlotte, however, opposed his willies, and unhappily for us both, we were clandestinely married, which was immediately followed by her afistiming my name, and presiding at my table.
For Some time our minutes rolled on in perfect harmony; whatever
opinion I held, Charlotte applauded;
H 3, whatever
102
whatever I censured, She reprobated. This unanimity, unexpected as it was delectable, counterbalanced every former Suffering, and I calmy ressgned
to
myself to this Scene of intellectual happiness. The acrimony of connubial jangling had not yet embittered our cup of bliss. Charlotte had not yet exposed, to the scruti’sszing eye of a husband, that irascihility of temper which had stepped dormant So long :
I
she had not yet declared those senti ments which at first convulsed, and at last dejected the foundation of our union : she had not yet avowed, that she married me out of an impatience of celibacy. I, in my turn, had not
yet

yet indulged my humour in provoking her rage. I had not yet attacked her for dissfenting against: my new modelled Systems; I had not yet con scssed, that I only Satisfied an idle whim in attaching myself to her.

Your pitiable Charlotte, artfully disengaging herself from the formal and officious attendance of her physician, invited me to a conference with her last evening, upon a Subject, as she expressed herself, too delicate for any, but those who had experienced the luxury of unrequited love. There was a Sadly pleasing composure upon her features, when, with faltering accents, I accepted her proposal. She thanked me for my complaisance, in

In Spite of his reststance, unmoved by his piercing lamentations, I tore him from the bedclothes, which, in the paroxysm of his passion, he had resolutely grasped, and hurried him from 'this dangerous Scene into my study, where I resgned him to the

The Situation ofvtwo people, whose Soul whose Sates are blended into one, pouring forth, in the Softest accents, desires almost ineffable, and
melting into blandisliments Soothing, and inviting; whose caresses, in Some blessfed recess, have So deran2; ed the
