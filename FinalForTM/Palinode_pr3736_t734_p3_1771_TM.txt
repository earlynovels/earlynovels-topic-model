of women, that having been early taught to contemn them, I could not have So easily shaken off the prejudices I had imbibed in the Spring of my life
against them, had they not forcibly made me conscious of my folly and their worthiness. The prepossessions of youth cannot be destroyed but by time, and a concatenation of happy circumstances :
through the want of the latter, many live and die in the errors they mistook for truth, when their reason in its infancy could not discern between right and wrong. We were told, thou and I, at Oxford, that female virtue was a chimaera: the levity and falsehood of women, were the constant topic, of all our leisure hours — Like enthusiasts we

believed without knowing the motives of our credulity. Rich and inde|>€n dant, thou followedst fashion, and

LETTER IV
#
'"in HOU hadst not left Oxford three
months, when a letter I received from my father, plunged me into real misery, and from the happiest of the thoughtless Oxonians, made me the most anxious of all the rational beings. The loss of two ships richly loaded, which had been taken by a French
I
privateer off Cape Finisterre, reduced
4
him to the utmost indigence. — He had
w
but time to write the fatal news, as the
fear of his creditors compelled him to
. /
sty immediately to Holland. — “I have
no money to Send you, added he, nor
can
[ >3 ■ ]
can I provide for your future Support — you have knowledge and wit — there are opulent fools in England — your fate V is in your own hand; it will be your fault if it is unhappy. — Please or be ufefuk, if you poffess either of those advantages you need no other — without them, be ever So virtuous or learned, you shall languish your fife avray, the Scorn of mankind.” —
Had my father’s advice been accompanied by a purse of gold, I might have
ventured to London in Search of the
• >
fools he Spoke of. — But poor and friendless— — not angry Francis; I know
I
thou wouldst have taken me to thy bosom, and made me share in thy wealth, had I acquainted thee with my distress.
— In the first flutter of my Spirits, I did
not

i
not think of thee, and when friendship revived thee in my memory, love struck ' me silent;
L
Pride Suffering me not to stay at Oxford till my disaster should mark me out an object of pity, I Set off the next day on foot for London. The natural carelessness of my temper dissipated gradually the gloomy thoughts which had crowded into my mind; I laughed at an evil which it was not in my power to avoid. Hope and philosophy Supported my courage, and Spread flowers upon the road I walked. The third day of my journey, as I was crossing hyde park, I Saw at Some distance a throng of men and horses. A Iking for the cause, I was told it was a Sale of Some of the most beautiful
hunters
I *5 ]
✓
hunters in England. Thou knowest Francis, that I have studied horses more than Greek and Latin, and that I was renowned for my knowledge of their beauties and defects. Curiosity brought me to the place, where, at the first sight, I could not help admiring the hunters. They had Such a form. Such a life, as made me envy a noble lord who intended to purchase them. The affedlation of the jockey, in keeping unnecessarily the horses in a perpetual
movement, made me fuspicious. I ob ierved with the eye of Self interest, and Soon discovered a weakness in the left hinder leg of one of the hunters, which the art of his rider had Secreted from the spectators. Angry at the deceit, the villain designed to put upon the nobleman, I drew nearer his lordship,
and
f 16
and when he offered three hundred gui
*
for the lame hunter, 1 cried aloud,
, that the horse was not worth forty. Not worth'' forty! exclaimed almost every person present; and they looked upon me with the supercilious Smile of con tempt. No, not worth forty, answered I boldly. The horse courser, damning me and my judgement, desired Some of his friends to duck me in the Serpentine river. His desire they cheerfully undertook to gratify. I was nigh being the victim of. my honesty, when
lord C -- -- -- -, who in the mean time had
perused me from head to foot, humanely interposed in my favour, and Saved me from the rage of the disappointed sharpers. His lordship took me apart. “Who are you?” — unwilling to let him know what I had
been,

been, I told him, that having lately lost my master at Oxford, I was going to London in Search of a; place. What imperfection have you observed in that borse V — I whispered the discovery I

droteclion. Lord C -- -- -- -- turned to the
ockey, and ordered him to dismoimt. rhe unwillingness of the fellow to obey provoked his lordship, who charged his master with an intention to cheat him.
Ishat horsc is lame, Said lord C -- -- -- -- to

ed to be contented with that apology;.
A
the Spedfators resented it with an honest anger.. They all to a man fell upon the horse courser and his friends and'chastifed them Severely for their impudence. After lord C — had for a few minutes feasted his indignation with the punishment deservedly insiidled upon'
t
the Scoundrels, he thanked me for the
«
service' I had done him, and bid a Servant to show me the way to his house.

The sight and feeling of the twenty guineas, tempted me often to leave lord C — — ’s Service, and I know not what would have been the consequence of that perpetual temptation,, had not my father’s letter occurred, to my mind. I

I fell at his lordship’s feet, and Swore to make myself worthy of the trust he
\
reposed in me. My new post requiring. Some elegance in my dress, I became the next day, by the art of the taylor, a very Smart well looking fellow, So Smart, that lady C — — ’s waiting women, who, before, had not deigned to take any
notice of Jack, gazed upon master ram bier with a Smile, and courted his friendship. My lady viewed me with a side glance, and, turning to her lord, muttered her approbation of the choice he had made.
No Servant in the family murmured
at my promotion : Jack had been long
their
[ 25 ]
their favourite; and as I had not the silly pride to forget what I had been, they all applauded the partiality of their master in my Savour.
I had not been a week in m; y place, before I perceived that the countess looked upon me rather as a Spy over ^ her behaviour, than as a man devoted
f
to her. She thought me the tool of her hushand’s jealousy, and accordingly treated me with a coolness I deserved
not. I ashed her waiting wmman V hy I displeased when I was So studious of
doing my duty. “I was wrong to complain; her ladyship did me justice; but she was not' used to be tamiliar with her people.” those constant answers not Satisfying me, I determined vol. I. C to

One morning that her women were gone down to breakfast, her ladyship ringing the bell, I entered her apartment, and ashed for her orders. —
“It is not you, sir, I want; be pleased to call one of my women up. —
And fly stepped to her closet.

One morning that lord C -- -- -- -- - had

The novelty of my behaviour struck

the countess with amazement and grief. My taste for hunting, and my excursions in the country, which lasted Sometimes two or three days, made her apprehensive of my indifference. She fancied my reason had conquered over passion, and that I found in a new attachment the pleasures she had denied me. Although unwilling to favour me, she could not think of a rival without pain.
One afternoon that she was engaged at whist, I retired to a window to breathe the fresh air. The game being Soon at
an end, she came to me.

having read it. Said he was obliged to go to Lincoln the next day. -- -- -- -- -

The ' part I was to perform upon the state of the polite world, flattered my pride; I was impatient to begin it, and that impatience sided for me against the charms of the countess, and the fedudions of love.

THE facility with which I had Said,

I
men living in Society, I Saw no meanness in the hypocrisy by the mean of
which 1 was to become great and opulent. Had the person of Mrs. Guery been as uripleasant as it was desirable. Virtue would have told me not to sacri
I
'sice her happiness to ray ambition, and
perhaps would I not have opposed her triumph; but certain that Mrs. Guery would never repent her confidence in me. Virtue was Silent, and self-interest confirmed my resolution.
■' I •
To carry this feigned amour with the looks of truth, and Secrete it from the countess, required an art I was afraid not to be master of. Mrs. Guery was often with her; at that time, could I at in character without displeasing cither of them? the countess had already

I
1 h7 j
dy reproved me for my attention to Mrs. Guery — Would not Mrs. Guery be, as naturally, provoked at an indifference I should causelessly affect?? modest and reserved women are, '
%
their pride is always delighted with a public homage. Coquettes would be
an unknown being, would men pay,
but in a tue a tite. their tribute of fiat
tery and adorations.
\
Rather than to give an hour of un easiness to the countess, I would have chosen to fink again in my former
station, and vegetate, all my life in a disgraceful obfeurity. I hoped her
virtue would, at last? conquer over her passion, and change it into friendship. The woman who had So often come off victorious over love and nature, could
H 2 not
[ 148 ]
not long indulge a Sentiment Ibe was determined never to gratify.
“When her reason, assisted by absence, or the Scarcity of our private conversations, shall resume its power, the countess will applaud my behaviour, and countenance my ambition. -- -- -- -- Till
that day comes, I must dissemble — let
/
me lose the fortune I covet — it will be
no loss if the countess is happy.” — _
•
r
After that Soliloquy, I refieded on
0
the authority a Sensible woman has over the passions of a young man. From a theorical knave, longing for the practical part, I had been, by degrees, forced into a delicacy of Sentiments I had not ' the idea of. Had not the virtue of the
countess been put to the test by the Severe
[ 149 ]
vere trials it had undergone, she would have had no influence over my morals — I would have attributed her virtue to my stnshilfulness, or want of a proper opportunity, and continued an unbeliever to female chastity.. My esteem commenced my reform; I blushed at the errors I had entertained, and well come at last principles I had till then
f
laughed at. This alteration was not the only one the conntefs operated in my mind. I mistrusted what I heard every day against the fidelity of women, and undertook their defence openly,

Hence it happens that a really virtuous woman is often, from the coquet try of her manner, mistaken for a voluptuary, whilst the drapery of decency ranks the voluptuary among the devotees to virtue. A husband is Seldom beforehand with the public in the Secret of his wife’s intrigues.

upon me, when he pronounced the imprecation, he would undoubtedly have discovered in my features, the Symptoms of guilt. To free me of that troublesome qualm of conscience, and of the fear of being understood, I gave a gayer turn to the conversation, and told his lordship the judgement most of nay friends had formed of the women.

That levity has no influence over their morals, totally independent of the external form they think, proper to assume. None but fools will; judge of the virtue of the women from their dress, gesture and conversation: those fancy or opinion dilates, and have no other tendency than to Set off the charms they possess, and make them more conspicuoussy graceful and lovely.

pointment, and the compliments I paid
to my self-love for the happy turn I had given to my assaults against the
S virtue of Emily. I thought she believed me : I was mistaken. At the dawn of the day I was awoke by Lucy.

I got up, and stepped into a room, from whence I could, unseen, observe the motions of Emily. I had hardly
given my orders to my valet de chamber., when she came into the yard, and, after having thrown her looks every way
r
for fear of Spies, fly tiptoed to the chaise, and leapt into it. Emily had not indulged two minutes the hope

Surprised at my not following her, and at thp order given to the postilions to Set our, and take the road to London, she called to them to stop.

A S Emily had rode above three ]
^ ^ hours in the dark the night before, I was in hopes that she would not ] perceive the deceit put upon her; but ■' an unlucky post ereded in a cross way betrayed me. Reading distindlly upon it road to Lincoln, her panic terrors changed into a real fear. She insisted upon my coming to her. ~
“Read, my lord — Will you boast your honour again? —

What? is it but this minute you discovered we were posting away to
Lincoln? -- Upon my word, madam,
your Surprise wrongs your understanding. — Have I not told you that yoiw mother expedls you at Lincoln? You despise me indeed, if you think I could take upon me to give her up to the mortal anxiety of waiting in vain for your arrival. What would not be her anxiety had I complied with your caprice? -- -- 1 neither can nor will punish
Mrs. Clinton for the injustices of her daughter -- -- When I have delivered
you into her hands, madam, no

proud to bear with an usage I do not

Then bowing respedlfully, and draw ng a few paces back, I beckoned to

“My lord? —
Madam? —
Madam! am I no more your emily?” ?” — •

The tone of her voice had a Sedudlion, which I did not attempt to resist. I opened the door of the chaise, and Sat near her. emily’s half blushes and half Smiles telling plainly she resented my behaviour, and loved me, I had the discretion not to Speak one word that might recall the past into her

mind. The dignity of her deportment struck my heart with remorse — fearing her virtue should force her to hate me, when not finding her mother at Lincoln, she would in me See a villain instead of a man of honour, I resolved to tell her the truth, but to colour it in a manner as to avoid her hatred, though I could not her indignation. After we had taken fresh horses at the last stage, I artfully confessed my sin, humbly begged for absolution, and Swore a most Sacred oath to bring her back to her parents, if in a fortnight I could not obtain the consent of my uncle, or to wed her, should she not

disdain to give her hand to a man, who had no fortune to boast. The amazement of Emily was not So great as I
expefled;

“After the last night’s incidents, my lord, and the numberless impostures you have been guilty of, I cannot trust

Emily Seemed to yield to my ael vice; — Soon the appearance of three

gentlemen om horseback declared her dissimulation. When they came near enough to be heard,., she called for help — they immediately rode to the chaise, but my valet de chamber telling them that his mistress was troubled with, vapours, they galloped away.

“You are right; for had I been Successful, I might not have had the generosity to be just to Emily. ' Grati
tilde. Rambler, Seldom follows enjoyment — the woman who has made us
happy, is too often, like a troublesome creditor, the object of our aversion. The vaineness of my attempt has endeared Emily to me — now, I know her worth; before, I was uncertain of it —

“The odds were So much against her, my lord! A woman — a tender woman in the circumstance you have So feelingly related — she triumphed! I congratulate you upon her victory“

“After Such a trial, my lord, you mav boast a virtuous wife. -- --
“The woman who has not been

Her virtue has no more reality than the honesty of a man, whom avarice, hath

‘‘ Except those, whom age, stupi dity, or extreme ugliness Secure against
the flattery of men, what woman has not every day her own desires to Subdue, or a powerful tempter to resist? — ■
%
“Temptation, Rambler, has more or less power according to the degree of our Sensibility. Desire does not So forcibly actuate one woman, as it does another — that difference is the thermometer of my esteem of female honour. I respedt the woman, whose behaviour declares her modesty; but I com mend that only, who, under the despotic Sway of love, or of the want of

pieafure, continues a faithful devotee

indifference for the regularity of her conduct— — latter to the sense of her duty. —

worthy of your pardon — make him buy it by six months of Sorrow — it is in your power to punish.
For that very reason I must forgive — your kindness to me forces me to forget his wrongs. —
