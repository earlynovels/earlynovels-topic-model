MAN ON L’ESCAUT:,

A FRENCH STORY.

»
Returning from Rouen, whither
Some law bufiness in which I acted for my daughter had carried me, I took the road by Evreux, where I rested the first
night, and about noon the next day I found myself near Paffy.
%
On entering that little town, 1 was fur prised with the appearance of unusual bustle among the inhabitants, who were running from their houses, and gathering in crowds round the gate of a mean inn, where stood
B two

L 2 J
two covered wagons; the horses of which, almost exhausted with fatigue and heat. Seemed to be but just arrived from a long. journey. I stopped to inquire whence all this bustle proceeded, but could gain no information : the people, eager to gratisy their own curiosity, had not time to attend to mine. They continued preshng into the inn yard, where I at length Saw a fbldier, to whom 1 beckoned, and on his coming up to me, dessred to know what all this con fiifion meant? O nothing Sir, Said he; nothing but ten or twelve girls of the town, whom we are carrying to Havre de Grace, from whence they are to be transported to America: Some of them are pretty, which I suppose excites the attention of these peo
I
. pie.
tft
I was passing on after having received this information; but my attention was further excited by a woman whom I Saw com

ing out of the inn, wringing her hands, and
4
bearing on her countenance the impressions of horror and pity, whilst she exclaimed against the cruelty of the Scene she had been witness to. What is it then. Said I? — Ah!
Sir, replied the woman, go in yourself, and judge whether Such a sight is not enough to pierce one’s heart. I lest my hbrse; and with difficulty making my way through the crowd, I got irvto the room whiiher these poor creatures were carried, and where I was indeed struck with a most affecting Spedlacle.
Among the unfortunate women, who were chained together, six in each division, ’ by a chain passing round the body, there was one whose air and figure Seemed so little to correspond with the Situation she was in, ^ that had I Seen her in any other place I should have concluded her to have been a young woman of the first fashion. Such
B 2 was
i....
4 3
"Was the beauty and elegance of her face and form, that neither the deep depression She appeared to be under, nor the dirt and dust with which She was cover’d, could conceal it; and Ihe inspir’d me at once with pity and respedt. While she turn’d from the gaze of vulgar curiosity as much as her chain would admit, there was in her countenance and attitude Such an air of dignity and modesty, that it was difficult to believe ffie could ever have deferv’d the terrible punishment under which she wasvflifiering; and the expression of gri^r and terror impressed on Seatures, delicate, regular and animated, made her the most interesting figure I had ever Seen.
The six Soldiers who guarded these unhappy victims were in the room. I took - aside the commander of the party, and ask’d him what he knew of that beautiful young icreature? We took her from the hospital,
Sir,
[ 5 ]
Sir, Said he, with the others; probably she was not Sent thither for her good deserts.
I have often questioned her on the road, but she continues Silent. However, though I have received no particular orders to Savour her, I cannot help treating her rather better than the rest, as she seems to me to be Something above them. The young man who Sits there, continued he, pointing to another part of the room, can perhaps give you the information you dessre: he has followed her from Paris, weeping over her the whole way, and must certainly be her brother or her lover,
I turned towards the place he had shown me, and beheld, sitting on the Seat of a window, a young man who Seemed lost in the contemplation of his own misery. It is # impossible to conceive a more lively image of despair. His dress was plain, and even neglected; but the moment I Saw him I
B 3 knew
[ <5 ]
t
knew he was a man of fashion and education. I approached the place where he Sat; he arose; and in his figure, his air, his eyes, and the expression of his countenance, there was Something at once So commanding and
O O
insinuating, that I felt myselsimmediately and involuntarily disposed to love and Serve him. Do not let my intruston disturb you, Sir, Said I, fittingdown by him; but will you be So good as to satissy a curiosity I cannot reprels, to knovr who that very lovely young creature is who Seeius to belong to a rank So different from that in which I Iee her? Ah! Sir, replied he, I cannot insorm you who she is, without telling you also who I am, which very strong reasons make me wish to conceal. One circumstance, however, you may probably have learned from those fellows, continued he, (pointing to the Soldiers) which is, that I love her with the most vio lent passion, and that her Situation makes
me the most miserable of men, besore she
came
C 7 ]
came from Paris, I vainly tried every expedient to procure her liberty. Solicitations and address Sailing, I had recourse to force; but that has been equally unsuccesssuil; and I am condenined to See her dragg’d like a criminal to America. I have only one part to take, which is that of following and embarking with her; which I am determined to do.
d
\
But those inhuman wretches. Sir, (meaning the guard) will not suffer me now to approach her. My design was, (for why should I conceal it) to attack them openly with fire arms, at Some leagues distance from Paris; and I had by a considerable Sum of money hired four men to assist me; but the traitors no Sooner Saw me engaged, than they went off with my money, and as it would then have been vain to contend with six well armed, Soldiers, I gave up my pis tols, and proposed that they should Suffer
B 4 me
% •
• ^
[ 8 ]
me to follow the wagons, for which permission I promised to pay them handsomely, Tempted by that offer, they allowed me to accompany them; but I Soon found they would be paid every time they gave me leave to Speak to my unfortunate mistress : my purse was consequently Soon exhausted, and now that I have nothing left, they drive me back with the most brutal menaces, whenever I would approach her. Just before you came in, I attempted, notwithstanding their threats, to Speak to her, when one of them had the insolence to drive me back with his bayonet, and on my re preaching him, to level his piece at me. To Satisfy their avarice, and procure Such refreshment as may enable me to Sollow her on foot, I shall now be obliged to Sell the horse which brought me thus Sar.
f
Tho’ he endeavoured to collect himself while he gave me this little history, he could
not [
I
ft
[ 9 ]
not conclude it without tears. I do not press you, Sir, Said I, to discover to me more than you wissi to have known; but if I can be of any use to you I make you a sincere offer of my Services, and beg you will command them. Alas! Sir, replied
he, I See not the least ray of hope, and I Submit to my cruel destiny. In America I shall at least find myself at liberty with the woman I adore. 1 have written to a friend to Send me a Supply of money to Havre: all that distresses me is how to get thither, and to procure on the road Such assistance and comrorts for my dear unhappy girl, as her niiserable Situation will admit of. Well, Said I, Suffer me then to put an end to your anxiety on that point. Accept this trifle; and
be assured I lament I can no otherwise be of
/
Service to yon. 1 put four Louis into his hand, unperceivm by the guard, imagining that the knowledge of his haying money would only renew their extortion,
B 5 I then

[ 10 ]
, I then recolledled that possibly I might be able, Sora trifling consideration, to bargain with them So as that the young lover should have access to his mistress on their way to Havre, I called to the principal and proposed it to him; and notwithstanding his assurance, he Seemed ashamed of his cruelty. It is not. Sir, Said he consusedly, it is not that we refuse to let the young man Speak to the person he dessres to be with, but only he wanted to be always near her, which is very inconvenient to us; theresore it is but just he should pay us for that inconvenience Well then, Said I, let us See at how much you value the indulgence? He had
J
the effrontery to alk me two Louis, which I gave him immediately; assuring him at the Same timei that I had given my direction to the young man, who would not fail to inform me if he broke his agreement, or otherwise mishehaved; and that I well knew in that cafe how to have him punished.

The lively and expressive terms in which the unsortunate stranger assured me of his
gratitude, convinced me he deserved all I
/
had done for him. As I passed out I Spoke a Sew vrords to his mistress, who answered me with Such an enchanting modesty, that I lest the room deeply ressedling on the extraordinary and incomprehensible characters,
of women.
R eturning again to my Solitude, I heard no more of these unhappy young people; and near two years having passed ssnee I met them, the impression they had made on my mind was almost effaced, when chance again brought them to my recollection, and furnished me with the means of hearing the whole of their disastrous history.
Landing at Calais, in my way from London, I was detained there by I know not what circumstance, that day and the following
L J
lowing night. As I passed through the street about noon, I thought I Saw the Same young man whom I had met two years before at Paffy. He had an old portmanteau under his arm, and appeared to be just come on shore: his dress was mean, and he was much paler and thinner than when I first Saw him, but the uncommon elegance of his person, and the turn of his countenance, faded as it was, left me no reason to doubt he was the Same. I Spoke to him : he immediately recolledled me, with expressions of joy and affection not to be described.
•i
Ah, my dear Sir! cried he, have I then once more an opportunity of affiiring you of my eternal gratitude. 1- inquired from whence he came? By Sea from Havre, replied he, where I lately landed from America. alass! my poor friend, Said I, you do not Seem to have returned in a very for tunate Situation. Go, continued I, to le

Lion dor; I will come to you there presently. I Soon rejoined him, impatient to have an account of his misfortunes, and of the circumstances of his voyage, which he. now no longer hesitated to give me. You have behaved So nobly to me. Sir, Said he, that it would be the basest ingratitude to conceal anything from yon. Yes, you shall now have at once the history of rny misfortunes, and of the indiscretions, the shameful weakness, which has brought these missortunes upon me. While your reason obliges you to condemn me, I know, from the goodness of your heart, I shall still have your pity.
Here then begins the pathetic recital of my young friend’s unhappy fortune. I put it upon paper immediately aster having heard it; therefore my narrative is ex ad, though I am sensible it will be much less intc’ resting to those who not having leen him

The History of the Chevalier des Grieux and Manpn de L'efcauti
#
yi T the age of Seventeen I had com -- jr. pleated my studies at Amiens, whither my parents, who are of one of the first families in Picardy, had Sent me.
My conduct and manners there had been So well regulated, I had obtained So high a character for Sobriety and application, that I was by the masters proposed as an example to the college. Nor did this cost me any great efforts: born with a dispofi tion naturally mild and tranquil, my inclination led me to books, rather than to the turbulent amusements of lads of my age j and the marks of aversion I had Shown to actual vice, had given me the credit of having an uncommon share of virtue.
“' My
I
[ .6 ]
My high birth, my apparent rpplication, and Sviue ex.erior advantages which I possessed, had recommended me lo the i notice and favour of the principal people j of the place.
I had finished my exercises with So general an approbation, that the Bishop of the diocess, who was present at the exhibition of the College, propoied to me the ecclesiastical line, as a road in which I should rise to quicker and higher preferment than any I could hope ior in the order of Malta, for which my parents designed me, and in pursuance of which ' design I already wore the cross of the order, with the name of the Chevalier des Grieux. The College vacation being come, I prepared to return home; my Sather intending to Send me Soon aster wards to finish my education at an Academy at Paris.
I had

I had now fixed the day for my departure from Amiens. Happy had it been for me if I had gone one day sooner: : should then have avoided the sight of that dangerous beauty, to my pashon for whom, I owe all the miseries that have pursued me thro’ life, and have plunged me at length into the deepest gulf of despair.
I regretted nothing in leaving the college but being Separated from a friend, with whom, during my stay there, I had contradled the closest intimacy. We had gone thro’ a course of studies together; but tho’ he was Some years older than myself, he was to continue longer at College, because the Small fortune he was likely to inherit from his family was not enough to fnpport him in any other profession than that of a churchman, for which he was therefore dessgned : and the
acquisitions
[ IS 1 ■ '
acquisitions necessary for that profession

required a longer attendance.
I
ft i
In the course of my narrative you will remark that this beloved friend pos seffed every good quality that can dignisy human nature, with So pure and exalted an attachment to me, as Surpasses the most celebrated examples of antiquity. If I had followed his advice 1 had been happy! ' Or if aster my first error, I had not Shut my ears against his admonitions, as vrell as against the voice of my own reason, I stiould St least have Saved Something from the wreck of my fortune and my reputation. Alas! in return for his friendship I treated • him with coldness and ingratitude, and flew from him as a troublesome monitor whose advice was an affront to my understanding,
I
4
On the evening of the day which was. to be the last of my stay at Amiens, I
was

t 19 3
was walking through the street with this friend, whose name was Tiberge, when the stagecoach from Arras drove into the yard of an inn near which .we happened to be; we Sauntered in in the idle way of people who have nothing to do, and we Saw Several women get out of the coach, who went immediately into the house; but one remained standing by the coach door, while a man, fisty or Sixty years old, who Seemed to have the care of her, was taking her baggage out of the boot.' This young woman, who could not be more than fifteen, immediately attracted my attention. So uncommon was her beauty, that I, (who had never made any observation on beauty till then, and had Iben the prettiest women without • being at all affected by their charms,) was immediately struck with it to a degree that appeared like the effect of fascination. That Sobriety and steady
conduct
«•
r 20 ]
conduct fur which I had gained So much applause, vanished in a moment. The timidity which I had before been remarked for, even to a degree of ridicule, was gone I knew not how. I went up to’ the lovely creature, who was already mistress of my heart, and asked her what was the fortunate occasion of bringing her to Amiens, and what acquaintance she had there? She answered me ingenu olissy in a Sew words, that she was Sent thither by her parents to go into a convent; it being their intention to make her a nun. I was enlightened enough by my insant pashon to know that this resolution would be the death of my new formed hopes. I Spoke to her in a way which gave her Sushcient intimation of my Sentiments. Though she was younger than myself, I found her infinitely better informed; and probably it was her early maturity, and her violent inclination for
gaiety
t J
4
gaiety and pleasure, that had determined her parents to Secure her from the consequences of Such propensities. — Fatal propensities! which have ruined both her and myself.
Entering into difgource with her, I exclaimed against the barbarous intentions of her friends, and. argued with all the pedan -- tic eloquence I had acquired at college. She affected neither reserve or disdain, but told me. Simply and naturally, that Ihe Sore saw all the unhappiness stie was to Suffer in a state of lise for which she had not the least disposition, but that she must Submit because it appeared to be the will of Heaven, which had given her no means of avoiding it. The pensive sostness of her countenance, and the melancholy music of her voice, while she pronounced these words, or rather the ascendancy of my evil des tiny, which had Seized me to drag me down to my undoing, prevailed So far on
my
L 22 J
rny intoxicated senses, that I was no longer master of myself. Without ressedting one moment on what I was about, to Say, I as sured her that if ssie would rely on my honour, and on the extreme passion with which She had inspired me, I would from that moment dedicate my whole life to her service, deliver her from the tyranny of her relations, and place all my happiness in
procuring her’s. I added everything that
0
I thought likely to induce her to put herself instantly under my protection. My beautiful unknown was well aware that at my age deceit was little to be apprehended, and she did not hesitate long between the prospedt of affluence and pleasure I offered her, and the gloom of a convent. She told me that if ffle Saw the least probability of my rescuing her from a fate she abhorred, she could not refuse to hearken to my professions, and should think herfels
happy
L 23 J
happy to owe to me a liberty which shq valued more than life. '
I repeated to her that I vas ready to undertake everything: but having no knowledge of the world, nor any idea of the ma
\
necessary for an intrigue, I con
4
tinned to run on in the warm expressions of love, when her old condudtor returned; and our conference was on the point of ending very little to either her satissadlion or mine, is the readiness of her invention had not found a remedy for the stupidity with which his unwelcome arrival had struck me. Without being the least disconcerted, she continued talking to me; and addressing me by the name of her coussn, told me
that Since she was fortunate enough to meet me at Amiens, she would delay her entrance into the convent till the next day, that she might have the pleasure of Supping with me that evening, in compliance with my invitation. 1 immediately

man, but had long Since been Settled at Amiens by his bounty; a man whom I knew to be entirely devoted to my Service.
I conducted her thither myself; while the old Servant, who Seemed but little pleased with this new acquaintance which his charge had made, followed us with a discontented countenance; and my friend Tiberge, who was very much amazed at the whole Scene, walked by in profound Silence. He had not heard the Subject of our discourse, having Sauntered backward and Sorward in the inn yard during this short conversation, in which I was gone a whole age in love; and I knew too much of his dispofition, not to be aware that I could hope for no indulgence from him in the mad project I had undertaken; neither did I believe he 1
would even be a quiet Spectator. There 1

fore to get him away I pretended to re
\
Something I had neglected, which I told him must be done before I departed the next morning; and he undertook the commission, though he Saw my motive
for giving it to him.
«
I then found myself at liberty to Say to my charming mistress all that the most unbounded passion could dictate; and never perhaps were transports greater than mine. My fair unknown told me her name was Mademoiselle Manon l’el caut. She appeared Battered by the sue cess of her charms, and conseffed that she thought me very amiable, and that she should be'happy to give up to me that liberty which but for my attachment must have been lost in the terrors of perpetual confinement. She inquired of what family I was; and being herself born in an inserior rank,
4
C r'
or
• ^
C 26 i
of iise, was hot a little elated to hear that the person who whs become her Have was of So considerable a family.
We now began to consider what we should do to prevent our being parted; anel after various plans, that of immediately eloping Seemed the only feasible one. Though the man who. attended her was only a Servant, it required great management either to get him out of the way or escape from him: we theresore agreed to have a chaise ready besore he should be awake in the morning, and go directly to Paris where we intended to be immediately married; I had about fifty crowns by me; (as my father gave me a very handsome allowance, which, having few expenses, I never exceeded) my mistress had about double that suiuj to pay the charges of her initiation into the Convent; and we thought, like two
children
C 27 ]
children as we were, that an hundred and fisty crowns were an inexhaustible Sum! and we depended as much on a Support aster our elopement, as we did that our Scheme to get away would Succeed. Having Supped with my charming Manon, with a degree of gaiety and Satisfaction I had never before felt, I went home to prepare for the morning.
My arrangements were the more easily made, bccause having before designed to quit amiens the next day, my baggage was already packed up, and I Sound no difficulty in getting it carried to the inn, nor in Securing a chaste to be ready at five o’clock in the morning, which was as Soon as the gates of the town were opened. But I had yet an obstacle to suf mount to which I had not sufficiently attended, but which had nearly rendered my whole design abortive
C 2 My
[ ]
My friend Tiberge, though only three years older than myself, was of the most regulated conduct and strictest morals; and his warm attachment to me made him very quick Sighted in Whatever related to me,
i
The conversation I had held with so beautiful a girl as Manon, and my offi ciolifly conducing her to another inn, as well as the finesse by which I had contrived to dismiss him from the party, had given him Sufficient reason to susped me; but unwilling to offend me, he would not return to the place where he had lefi us together, but waited for me at my lodgings, where I found him on my return.
I was out of humour when I Saw him, which he easily perceived; Sori found it impossible to conceal the constraint his presence laid me under. “I am Sure, my
rlpaf
[ ^9 ]
dear Des Grieux, ” Said he, “that you are engaged in Some pursuit which you wilh to conceal from me. I See it plainly by your manner.’* I answered him with Some tart fiess, that I did not conceive myseif obliged to give him an account of my actions. “No, ” returned he,. “you certainly are not; but you call me your friend, and Surely as Such I am entitled to Some degree of confidence.” In short, he pressed me So warmly, that I, who had never concealed from him any emotion of my heart, found myself unable to refuse him the Secret it now laboured with: I declared to him the violence of my pas fron, and owned the wild projecst I had determined on to posies myself of the ol> jed of it.
But hardly had this unguarded detail concluded, before I repented of having made it. Tiberge was too Sincerely my Jriend to hear of Such a Scheme with tem
C 2 oer i
[ 30 ]
per; and he received my confelfion with an air So cold, and a countenance So discontented, that I immediately trembled for the success of my undertaking; and not without reason, when he told me that he was determined to oppose it to the utmost of his power. He represented to me in strong terms all the Solly of what I was about to do; and concluded by protesting that if I still persisted in hazarding so ruinous and disgraceful a measure, he would insorm those of my destgns who had more power than he possessed, effectually to prevent me.
■ I was hals distradted that I had So indis
✓
cretely betrayed myself, well convinced that (what I then thought) his ridiculous prudence would entirely defeat all my well concerted plans, and Separate me for ever from Manon. However I began to recoiled that in this ill timed confidence I had
not
L 31 J
not told him that I meant to go off the very next morning; and I determined to deceive him by an equivocation. “Tiberge, *’ cried I, “I always thought you my friend, and by your prcsent conduct you show yonrself truly So. I meant only to hear what you would Say to my pro je<5t: as to executing it directly it is not what I have resolved upon. It is true I am diftrafledly in love with this girl, and find it impossible to live without her; but I shall not be So rash as I have made you suppose. Nevertheless as I cannot flatter you with any hopes of curing me of a pas sion which is at this time a part of my existence, I shall certainly continue to See her as long and as often as in my power.
For this reason I shall delay my return home for a few days. Come to me tomorrow morning; I will carry you with pie to See her; and when yoii have conc

The conduct of my friend Tiberge, when he found how I had deceived him, you will know hereafter: you will hear with Surprise theexcess of his zeal and attachment; and you will feel how unpardonable my conduct must have been, and how much I must now Suffer in refledling that I have requited Such generosity only with the blackest ingratitude.

ment: but now, as we saw ourselves So near Paris, and out of danger from pursuit, we determined to stop for Some hours, So unguarded was our behaviour, that our host and postillions could not but remark it; and added to our extreme youth, and the haste we appeared to be in, it gave them Sufficient cause to sus pedl the nature of our connexion and adventures.
Though our project of being married was now forgotten, certain it is, that naturally tender and constant as I was, I should have been happy my whole lise with Manon had she been but faithful. The sweetness of her temper, the soft ness of her heart, and the vivacity of her humour, added to the uncommon attractions of her person, gave her every hour an encreased ascendancy over me. My attachment was So strong, that 1 should

happiness of any other man, have rendered me the most miserable being on earth.
On our arrival at Paris, we took a ready furnished lodging in la rue de V —, which most unhappily for me was at that time inhabited by Monsieur de beau manoir, a, celebrated Farmer General,

Three weeks pasted away, in which I was so entirely engrossed by niy passion that I thought of nothing else; but the natural turn of my temper, and the quiet way in which we lived, without company
or dissipation, brought back to my alienated mind the idea of my family, and of the pain my father must feel from my

absence and the uncertainty of what was become of me.
I determined immediately to make advances towards a reconciliation with him; and even flattered myself that if I could prevail on him once to See ivjanon, he would be So captivated with the beauty of her person, and her Seducing manners, that I could easily persuade him of what I myself firmly believed, that her heart ' and understanding were equal to the graces of her form; in which case I was ilire that her being without fortune, or of an obscure family, would not prevent his consenting to my marrying her: and to

marry her was still my intention, though 1 was now convinced 1 could not do it for

[ 37 3
I communicated my restedlions to Manon; and told her, that besides motives of love towards her, and duty to my father, which infiuenced me, I had yet another which ought to be of Some weight, and that was necessity; for our finances were by this time So very much reduced, that I was .entirely cured of believing them inexhaustible, Manon heard this discourse with a coldness that quite disconcerted me. She represented to me the hazard I ran of being Sorced away by my father as Soon as he knew where I was concealed; and Spoke tenderly of the pain She stiould then Seel in being Separated from me. As to the plea of necessity, she answered that we had yet enough to Support us Some weeks, ' and that when our present money was gone, she doubted not but that fiie should find resources in the kindness of Some of her relations in the country, who she was
Sure
L J
sure would Supply her as Soon as She applied to them. To these objedlions, as they Seemed to arise from her affedhon for me, and her fears of losing me, I easily yielded, and gave up for the present all thoughts of writing to my father.
I
This little difference of opinion she Softened by So many bewitching marks of tenderness and attachment, that I, who absolutely adored her, gave myself up implicitly to her will, and believed that whatever she advised was right. Intoxicated as I vas with my extravagant passion, I dreamed not of the bitter return that was even now preparing for me! Manon had hitherto been my banker, and had entirely managed our little expenses; nor had I found any reason to suspedl her prudence, till a few days after the conversation I have just related, I remarked that our table
was
I
r 39 ]
was better Supplied than usual, and that Manon had added to her dress Several articles of a price and quality, much higher than she had before possessed. As I knew the money remaining in her hands could not exceed twelve or fdurteen pistoles, I could not help expressing my surprise at what I Saw : but Manon answered that I need be in no pain on that account. “Did I not tell you, ” Said she. Smiling, “that I should find resourcesi” ’ I loved and trusted her with Such simple faith that I ^ was not easily alarmed. I believed she might really have received Some assistance from her relations, and was for that time content.

But a few days afterwards I went out aster dinner, having told her I should be absent all the evening. Not however finding those at home with whorn I meant

I asked her why She had kept me there so long? She answered, in apparent consu* lion, that she had not heard me. It happened that I had rapped only once; I naturally therefore ashed her, why is she had not heard me she had opened the door at all I .This question So totally disconcerted her, that having no presence of mind to form another excuse, she buru into tears, assuring me that it was not her fault, but that her mistress had forbidden

At this explanation, which I received as I was going up Hairs, I became like a statue. The Surprise I was under was Such, that not knowing what I did, I came downstairs again, and pretending to have forgotten Something, went hastily out of the house, bidding the girl tell her mis tress that I should be back directly, but by no means to mention that she had told me of her having been visited by Monsieur de Beaumanoir.
The consternation and distradtion of my mind deprived me for Some moments of my Saculties. I walked along, breath kfs and stupid, till I came to a coffeehouse, into which I entered; and Sitting down by a table, I threw my arms on it, and laid down my head, trying to deve lope Sentiments of rage, jealousy and mad ness, till then unselt, Hardly dared I repeat to myself the words I had heard,
and

and could Scarce persuade myself but that ’ the whole was an illusion. Sometimes I;
4
determined to return home, and to take no notice of what I had heard. So impossible did it appear that Manon could be faithless, that even to suppose it a moment Seemed a crime. Surely, thought I, the Sentiments of my own bosom are not better known to me than those of Manon. Can that Soft temper, that ingenuous countenance, conceal a perfidious and cruel heart? No! it is impossible!! cannot be So abandoned!
Still however this visit of Monsieur de
Beaumanoir was a circumstance not to be
got over: and then the acquisitions Manon
had lately niade of dress and ornaments
darted across my brain, and Seemed to
confirm the dreadsnl idea of a newer and
«
a richer lover. The reliance too she

our Support; from whence could it arlle but from having Secured to herself Somie powerful protestor? On the other hand,
I had hardly been absent from her ten minutes Since our arrival at Paris: what opportunity theresore could Manon have had to listen to the addresses of any other man? At length I persuaded myself that I had' discovered the reason of this mysterious conduct, Monsieur de Beaumanoir, Said I, is a man of great business and con nedlions: probably the relations of Manon may thro’ his hands have remitted her part of the money she hoped to receive from' them; and today he may have brought her another Supply, which she has concealed from me to have the pleasure of Surprising me agreeably. doubtless she would have told me of it, if instead of coming hither to torment myself I had questioned her about it; and I am Sure
that
m
* i
C 44 ]
that when I ash her she will conceal from, me nothing that I wish to know.
/
I argued myself at length into a belief " that this was the truth. The agitation of
my Spirits subsided. I returned to my
. lodgings, and endeavoured to meet Manon
#
as usuah She received me also with an air of pleasure and affection, and I was tempted instantly to discover to her my late uneafiness, and its Source; but I refrained, still flattering myself she would lead to, the conversation. In that hope I Sat down to Supper with as much cheat fulness as I could assume; but when candles were brought I thought 1 Saw the traces of tears on the cheeks of Manon, and that an expression of inquietude Sat on her countenance. I observed that she turned her eyes on me with a look rather of pity and regret, than, of the warm Semiments they were generally animated
with.
ft

with. My eyes, while I made thesh remarks, were also fixed on her’s with a look of melancholy anxiety. We neither of us eat, but continued for Some moments gazing at each other in mournful Silence.
At length I Saw her beautistil eyes fill with tears, which streamed down her cheeks into her bosom. Perfidious tear!! she could not help shedding over the vicvim she was about to Sacrifice.
Manon! cried I, in the utmost emo
«
my dear Manon! what is all this?
O my God! what can be the matter! from whence these tears? You weep! and the occasion of your Sorrow is unknown to me. She answered me only by deep drawn sighs and a new flood of tears, which alarmed me almost to dis tradlion. I arose, and throwing my arms
m
round her, I conjured her by all our love, 'and is she would preserve my senses,
to
t 46 ]
to tell me instantly what had astlisted her? I caught the insedion, and shed tears myself while I kissed her’s from her cheeks as they fell. The most Savage heart must Surely have been moved by these wai m and artless expressions of love. Of love even to agony, which the sight of her grief threw me into.
While I was thus wholly occupied by my fear on her account, and conjuring her to explain the cause of her concern, I heard the steps of Several persons on the stairs: they tapped gently at the door; and Manon having kissed me, while tears Seemed to choke her utterance, tore herself away from me and ran hastily into'her drelfi ng room, the door of which she immediately locked within fide. I imputed this to herdis like of being Seen by any one, disordered and in tears. I advanced to the door to

bn what had besallen me. When I rt collcded the transadlions of the dayq they appeared So inexplicable that I was lost in conjedlures; yet none that I could

Thy life Shall answer thy officiousness, if it is thee I But then I remembered that the place of my abode was wholly unknown to him, and therefore it was impossible he could have given iny father intelligence of me. Could I fuspedl Manon? my heart revolted at the idea: yet the unusual melancholy which seemed to overwhelm her, her tears, and the kiss she had givex, me at parting, appeared very enigmatical. But still I felt disposed to believe that all her distress arose from a Sort of presentjment of our

approaching misfortune: So willing was I to deceive myself, and So impossible did I find it to believe that Manon would betray me. The result therefore of my conjecture was, that I had been Seen by Some persons who knew me in the llreets of Paris, who had watched me home,

and informed my father where I was concealed. This idea seemed consoling, and the perturbation of my mind began to fubside, I concluded 1 should suffer some Severe reproaches, and perhaps harsh treatment, from my father, which I determined to bear patiently; to promise whatever he dessred, and to escape as soon as possible to Paris, to restore life and happiness to my beloved Manon.

We passed the night at St. Dennis; and my brother had the' precaution to make two of the servants sseep. in the room with me, while another remained sentinel. When I entered the inn, I perceived it to be that where Manon and I stopped on our way to Paris; a circumstance I now remembered with the most painful regret. The master of the inn and his Servants recolledted me; and feeing my present sstuation, easily guessed at what had befallen me. To avoid their remarks, I hastened to my room as Soon as we got out of the coach; and at day break the next day wc Set out in my father’s post chaise, which was there waiting

My brother went to my father first, in the design of Speaking in my favour, by informing him of the docility with < which I Submitted to his orders; So that when I was admitted to his presence he received me with less Severity than I cxpedled. He contented himself with making me Some general reproaches for the fault I had committed, by absenting myself without his leave; and as to my mistress, he told me I thoroughly deserved what had happened to me, for my Silly credulity. He Said he had once a better opinion of my understanding; but hoped this adventure would teach me more prudence. I understood this discourse only according to my own ideas; and by no means as refledling on the fidelity of Manon. I shanked my father for his

that I was permitted to Speak of her who

occupied all my thoughts. But at length some expressions that dropped from my father, as it were by accident, attradled my attention. He mentioned interefiel ‘ Services done by Monsseur de Beaumanoir.
I was confused and shocked at that name, and Submissively dessred an explanation of my Sather. He turned towards my brother,
[ 53 ]
there, and inquired of him if he had nor related the whole to me? My brother answered, that I had appeared So tranquil and reasonable during the journey, that he did not believe I had occasion for Such a remedy to cure me of my folly.
I observed that my father then, hesitated whether he should explain himself: burr I entreated him with So much earnestness, that he determined to Satisfy me; or ra,, to assassinate me by the most; cruel of all recitals..
He ashed me if I had really been so simple as to believe that I had possessed the heart of Manon. I answered boldly that I was So Sure of it, that nothing in the world could induce me to doubt it at moment. My father broke into a loud laugh at the Solemnity of my manner, and the assurance I Seemed to have. ex.r celient! cried he; excellent! Truly, my ^

He added a thou Sand other railleries of the Same kind, while I remained Silent, with a beating heart. At length he continued to tell me, that
according to a calculation he had made, from the time of my departure from Amiens, Manon had loved me about twelve days; for, continued he, I know you went from thence on the tvfenty eighth of last month, this is the twenty-ninth of the present; it is eleven days Since Monsieur de Beaumanoir wrote to me; I suppose he might be Seven or eight in Sorming a connedlion with your princess: dedust

I
You find, Chevalier, added my father, ’ that Monsieur de Beaumanoir is now in poffefiion of your divinity, and removed you to obtain it.. For as to professions of disinterested; friendship from a man I never saw, I have seen too much of the world to, believe them; nor is De Beau ^

You majr however glory in the length of your triumph, considenng the excellent subject

I was no longer able to listen to a discourse, every word of which was a dagger to my soul. I arose; but had made only a step or two from the table, besore I fell on the floor, and for Some minutes lost all recollection in total insensibility.
Immediate assistance brought me to myself: but I opened my eyes only to shed a torrent of tears, and my lips only to complain in terms didtated by the bit terest despair. My father, who always tenderly loved me, was afistdted by the agony I was in, and employed every argument to console me. I listened to him, but understood not what he Said; and instead of the composure he recommended, I threw mysels at his feet, imploring him

O

lives to have been only one quarter of an hour at Paris : but in the wildness of my frenzy I had So openly declared my intention of going thither, that I Soon understood I was now prohibited from leaving my chamber. I measured, in gloomy Silence, the height of my window from the ground, and Sound all escape by that means impossible. I then addressed myself to the two Servants, and by every promise I thought likely to tempt them, endeavoured to prevail on them toiconsent to my escape: but their fidelity was not to be stiaken; and in the madness of despair I attacked them ..with menaces yet more impotent,

Finding every effort fruitless, my rage turned on myself. I determined to die. But as all means of destroying myself were carefully kept from me, and the Servants were constantly in the room, I could only throw mysels on my bed, resolute to resufe every kind of nourilhmesht, and to rise from it no more. I pasted the night with out steep, and the two following days without Sood. My Sather, alarmed at my obstinacy, came up to me on the evening of the Second. He Soothed me, and Spoke to me in a manner So affectionate, that he restored to me the power of shedding tears, of which the violence of my Sorrow had deprived me. Having at length brought me to listen to him, he absolutely commanded me to eat what he had directed to be brought to me, which with dishculty I obeyed; and for many days I took nothing but by his absolute command, and to avoid disobeying his peremptory orders.
But

But his tender attention, and the trouble [ he took to bring me to reason, by degrees affested me. I began to be ashamed of the ungratesul return I made to So much paternal goodness; and to hear him at least with patience when he endeavoured to cure me of my unworthy attachment, by inspiring my with contempt for Manon. Indeed it was impossible that I could esteem her as I had done; fickle, mercenary, ungrateful and perfidious. But Manon, Such as I once thought her, was ever present to my imagination. Her lovely Sorm was still before my eyes, and her enchanting voice continually vibrated in my ears. All these charms were I knew in the possession of another — of my worthless rival! But that reflection only added to my regret and my torment, without curing me of my passion; which in the bottom of my heart burnt with as much violence as ever. I can die, my father!

My father was astonished at my con dust; because knowing the principles of honour in which I had been brought up, he thought every Sentiment of my heart must revolt at the treason and duplicity of my mistress: but Seeing me still So devoted to her, he imagined my attachment was less to her in particular than to the Sex in general. persuading himsels strongly of this, and consulting only his affestion for me, he determined to Sacrifice his own views rather than thwart my inclinations, where they could be properly indulged. My dear Chevalier, Said he, it has hitherto been my intention, you know, to put you into the order of Malta; but I fancy your

indifferent to me; or rather, that I de

tested them all. Come, come. Said my father. Smiling, we will find one who in person shall be as like your Manon as pos sible; and who, with as many charms of face and figure, shall have an unblemished mind.

Six whole months elapsed without' producing any considerable change in my disposition. I felt only a perpetual and painsul vicissitude between - rage and love, hope and despair, as the image of Manon returned in different lights to my

mind. Sometimes I beheld her as the, loveliest. Softest, and most amiable of human creatures, and languistied to return to her; then I thought of her as a beautisul monster, stained with a thousand crimes, and made numberless resolutions to revenge mysels on her for all my Sufferings. Vain language of resentmerit and despondency! Manon was too deeply impressed on my heart. Nothing could ever erase the indelible impreshon which that tender though abused heart had received.
•ft
The only relief I found was in books; with which my father Supplied me in abundance. By degrees they attrasted my attention, and excited anew my curiosity.
1 went again through all the authors I had read at the College; and love had So much enlarged my ideas, that I now understood many passages of Horace and
Virgil

Virgil which had formerly been obscure to me. I amused myself with making am amorous commentary on the fourth book! of the Eneid., Alas! cried I, as I wrote it, ' Aeneas stiould have possessed an heart like mine, to have tasted and to have returned as he ought the passion of the tender
Dido.
In this state of mind I was: one day agreeably Surprised by a visit from my friend Tiberge; of whom I had hitherto thought merely as a School friend, whom a Similarity of studies and tempers had endeared to me for the time; but I had no particular reason to believe his attachment had taken a much deeper root than is usual among college acquaintance. I now found him So much improved. So formed in his person, So regulated in his manner, and with an air of Such dignity and uaderstanding, that he inspired me

with Something like veneration He Ipoke to me rather as an experienced monitor than as a young man but little older than myself; and while he lamented the error I had Sallen into, congratulated me on the advanced progress of my cure, and exhorted me to make use of experience So dearly bought, in the condust of my Suture lise.
I listened to this discourse from So young a man with astonishment. My friend! continued he, what I; Say to you, though it appears in an unusual style Sora man of my age, is not the less true; of which I am perfestly convinced. My inclination for pleasure is naturally as strong as your’s; but happily for me, my course of studies, and a mind over which reason has yet a stronger influence, has enabled me to compare the effests of indulging myself in dissipation, or adhering to strist rectitude
[ 68 ]
titude of morals; and I have been long So well persuaded of the advantage of the latter, that I have determined to conquer my popenfities to the follies of the world; and 1 have already So far learned to despise them, that I should before now have quitted it for ever, if my regard for you had not with held me. The hope of being useful to you, has kept me from leaving a Scene for which I have no longer any relish, and devoting myself wholly to a cloister. My dear Charles, I know the excellence of your heart, and the soundness of your understanding; and I am convinced there is nothihg great and good of which you are not capable.

He then told me my elopement from Amiens had given him Such extreme concern that he had tasted no satissastion asterwards, As Soon as I found, laid he, that you had deceived me, and was gone off with your mistress, I determined to follow you, which I did on horseback, with as much expedition as postible; a shut you had four or five shours the advantage of me, So that 1 had little cjiance of overtaking you.

Unwilling to Speak to her in public, I followed her coach till it fet her down at the door of an elegant house, where, on inquiry, I learned that she was Supported in this Splendid situation by De Beaumanoir, the Farmer General. The following day I went back to her house, and was admitted to Speak with her; but no Sooner did I mention your name, and begin an inquiry after you, than she turned hastily from me, and left me with evident Symptoms of diljpleasure and confusion. Nor could I afterwards gain any intelligence of you, but was obliged to return into the

weakness drew from Tiberge reproaches which I deserved but too much. Gradually however the ascendancy he once had over my mind reassumed its force. His friendihip was So nobly disinterested, he knew So well how to flatter my abilities, and to mingle praise and pity wilh advice and reproaches, that my inclinations again arose to embrace the lise I had
formerly
[ 7^ 3
formerly been disposed to, and to devote myself to the church with Tiberge. Alas! the impossibility of living for Manon had really more influence with me than the' distates of devotion, which I did not feel: and a world, in which I must be for ever Separated from her, was to me a world of insipidity and disgush
My resolution however to take the tonne sure became, as I then thought, every day more strongly confirmed. I remembered that in this line the bishop of Amiens had prognosticated for me honours andpreser ment: and So effestually was my imagination imposed upon by my present Sentiments, that I believed I could really renounce everything but the holy pursuits of religion. The deep impreshons of piety which my mind had received in the early part of my life, now Seemed to be - renewed with their pristine force, Occupied

pied by these ideas, I made in my day dreams a little arrangement of my future life, of which] this System of piety and tranquillity formed the ground work: I imagined a little Solitary house, Sheltered by a wood, and a clear rivulet running at the bottom of my garden; a library of well chosen books, a neat frugal table surrounded occasionally with a few virtuous and fensible friends, and a cor respondence with one of knowledge and erudition at Paris, who should inform me of all the events of consequence that might pafs there, less from any satis * ' I should have in hearing them, than to give me an higher relish for my retirement, in contemplating at a distance the vain and ridiculous pursuits of mankind. Having Iketched put this unclouded landscape in my imagination, I have Sometimes Said to myself, well. Surely in Such a Spot, and So Surrounded

by rational enjoyments, I shall posies' ' thing that is worthy the wish of a' reasonable being. Alas! the assertion was no Sooner made than my treacherous heart denied it — Secretly vrhifpered that the principal figure in Such a pisture was still wanting; and that even in the loveliest Solitude, a frightsul void would remain in my bosom, which could be filled only by Manon.
Tiberge, whose visits now became Sre* quent, obtained of my Sather a greater degree of liberty for me, and took upon himsels the completion of my cure. He encouraged that inclination for the ecclesiastical state with which he had first inspired me; and while my resolutions were yet warm, we mentioned my design to my father, who answered, that it had always been his determination to leave his children as much at liberty as prudence would allow,

in the choice of their professions; and that in whatever manner I chose to dif pose of mysels, consistently with honour, he would reserve to himself no other right than that of giving me advice. In regard to the present proposal, his only with was, that 1 would consider well what 1 was about, and not rashly enter into engagements which could never be re' ' Since the vows taken by the clergy were irrevocable.
t
I believed my resolutions unalterable 5 and as the season was now returning when the Colleges meet, it was Settled between Tiberge and me’ that we should put ourselves together into the Seminary of St,
Sulpice; where he was to finish his theological studies, and I was to begin mine. Before we Set out he was fortunate enough to obtain a constderable benefice from the bishop of the diocese, - to whom
E 2 his

My father, believing me long since cured of my attachment to Manori, and relying on the attention * which he knew Tiberge would exert to Save me from any new error, made no objestion to my going to Paris; where, on our arrival, I resigncd the cross of Malta for the clerical habit, ' and lost the title of Chevalier in that oi'

I applied myself to study So intensely, that I lost not a moment of the day, and ostsh borrowed from the night; So that II a very Sew months I made an unusual progress.

L
But how frail are all resolutions, and how little to be depended upon is the utmost apparent steadiness in a very young man. While I daily proceeded in this career, and began as I imagined to taste all the tranquillity arising from a clear conscience in the performance of my. duty, and from the prospest of Solid hap.. both here and hereafter; even in this disposition of mind, while I preferred a Sober meditation, or studying a page of St. Augustine, to all other pleasures, without even excepting the charms I found in the Society of Mademoiselle Manon, and while I beheld with pious horror the humiliating and disgraceful

thraldom in which Ihe had held me, even at that hour a Snare, was preparing for me, into which I not only Sell, but in consequence of which I was dragged to the bottom of an abyss of vice and insamy from whence there is no return.
It was now near a twelve month Since
t
I had been at Paris, without inquiring after Manon. At first I found this for bearance required great efforts, and a constant guard on myself; but the watchful prudence and nice admonitions of Tiberge, as well as my own reflestions, prevailed So far, that at the end of this period I thought myself on the point of forgetting for ever that Seducing but perfidious charmer.
At this time it happened that I was to
exhibit in public a theological exercise,
and I had invited many persons of fashion

to honour me with their presence, by which means my name and intentions became known throughout Paris. It reached the ears of Manon: and though She could not be absolutely certain it was myself under my newly assumed title of the Abbe dcs Grieux, yet the name itself was too interesting to her not to give her a strong cliriosity to listen whenever it was mentioned; and not being able to satissy herself any otherwise whether it was me or not, Ihe attended at St. Sulpice with Some of her acquaintance, where in the Abbe des Grieux, exhibiting a theological composition, she easily recognised her deceived and forsaken lover.

It was herself, but infinitely more lovely and dazzling than I bad ever yet Seen her. Her countenance was more bewitching than ever; her air and shape all that can be imagined of elegance and grace. She was now in her eighteemli year, and her beauty was Such as mull have been beheld to be fully known, for to conceive it from description is impossible!

Her embarrassment was at first equal to mine: but finding I continued Silent, she put a handkerchief to her eyes to wipe away the tears with which they were filled, and then in a timid and faltering voice Said, that she confessed her condlist might deserve my contemptand hatred, yet Surely if ever I had had any regard for her, it was cruel to let almost two years pass away without once inquiring aster her; and it accorded but little with the tenderness of my nature to See her in the distress she was then in besore me, withoist endeavouring to console her, without offering one word of pity or pardon.

I attempted to reply, but the words died away on my lips, and left me only the power to articulate, ah! perfidious, cruel, cruel Manon! Her tears flov/ed fast, while Ihe Said that she meant not to attempt to jus tisy herself. What do you mean then, cried I?

We sat down by each other. I took her hand in mine, and looking mournsully on her, ah, Manon!

Ah! how could you deliberately determine to affafiinate this bosom, which had no wish, no happiness but what you bestowed; or any desire So warm as that of Seeing you happy! Tell me, fickle and destrustive beauty! have you found another like it? Nature among all her works has made none So formed for love, faith, and despair! Tell me, however, have you not Sometimes regretted the heart you had wounded to death? — surely.you mush Yet now that you come voluntarily to lavish on me all these testimonies of affection, what dependance can I have upon you? To my destrustion, I See you are. more lovely, more bewitching than ever! By all the anguish I have Suffered! by all the Sacrifices I have made you! tell me, Manon, will you be more faithful? she.answered me So affestingly, protested

with So much earnestness her stncere repentance, and So Solemnly assured me of her Suture fidelity, that my heart was wholly Subdued.
Ah, Manon! Said I, intermingling expressions of Sacred and profane love, thou art too amiable for a creature! I find my Soul influenced by an irresistible delectation! All that I learned of intellestual liberty at St. Sulpice is a chimaera. I go to lose my fortune, my reputation, everything for you! I see it plainly. I read my destiny in that heavenly face. But for what Sacrifices, what misfortunes, will not your love console me! Fortune and glory, I give ye to the winds! my hopes of pre serment I resign, and give up all that I cannot enjoy with thee!

I now promised her an eternal and Sincere forgiveness for all that had pasted;; and when we began to discourse with ' more coh^ence, I desired her to tell me by what temptations she had been prevailed upon to leave me and to betray me to my father. She told me that monsieur de Beaumanoir having Seen her at the window, became passionately in love with her, and made her a declaration in the style of a Farmer General; that is, he wrote ‘ to offer her an handsome allowance, a house, carriage and jewels, if she would quit me and live with him. At first she affested to capitulate only in hopes of getting from him a Sum of money which might enable us to live comfortably, bat she gradually became dazzled by his pre | and promises But I might judge, she Said, of her relustance and remorse,. when I recollested the grief that overwhelmed her the evening of our Separation;

tion; and that not withstanding the opulence that had Surrounded her, She had
/
never been happy with De Beaumanoir: not only because he possessed not my Sentiments and my manners, but because, amid all the gaiety .and pleasure Ihe was induced to partake, the remembrance of my love and attachment still festei^d in her heart, which incessantly reminded her of her ingratitude, and tormented her with reproaches, for which dissipation was a very inadequate remedy.
She mentioned the visit Tiberge had
O
made her. Had he shown me a dagger Sent by you to avenge your wrongs, I think it could not, have struck me more painsuliy than did the Sound of your name; and his inquiries I was quite unable to answer. She then told me how she happened to hear of my being at Paris, and of the exercise I was to per

form at the Sorbonne; and that she had been So agitated during the performance, that it was with the utmost difficulty Ihe restrained her tears and exclamations.i H avinst staid till the last, that her disorder

might not be noticed, and disengaged herself from her companions. She listened only to the impetuosity of her wishes toj Speak to me, and ordered her coadij direstly to St. Sulpice, determined not to[
Survive my refusing to forgive her. i
!
Where is the savage heart that this! livedy repentance and returning tendernefsi would not have affested? As to myself, I felt at that moment that I should for
ft
Manon have religncd all the Bishoprids of the Christian world.. i
But it was time to consider what we' intended to do. Manon desired me instantly to quit the Seminary, that we
might
[ 89 ]
might consult together in a place of greater sasety; and as I then recollested that every moment it was probable Tiberge might come in Search of me, there was no time for hesitation. She got into her coach, and ordered it to wait at the corner of a neighbouring Street; and a moment asterwards I escaped from the house without being qiieftioned by the porter, and rejoined her. We then drove to la fripperie, where I Surnilhed mysels with a coat, hat, and a Sword, which Manon paid Sori had not a shilling in my pocket; and we both So much dreaded being impeded in our flight, that she insisted on my not going
t
to my room to Setch what money I had. Indeed the Sum was inconsiderablc: and as she was well provided, we relinquished it without relustance.
We conferred together in the fripier’s shop on what was next to be done. Manon
determined
[ 90 ]
determined to keep no terms with De Beaumanoir, but to Sacrifice him wholly to me. I will leave the Surniture, Said she,
* and the things in the house, exastly as they are; but the jewels he has given me ■ are Surely my own, as are about' Sixty thousand francs, which I have Saved out of the Sums of money he has given me; fmce I have lived with him. He has no power over me, therefore we may take a convenient house, and live comfortably ai Paris without any apprehensions of his molesting us.
r
I represented to her that tho’ there was no risk for her in Such an arrangement, there was much for me, who could hardly fail of being known, and stiould continu l ally be exposed to the Same danger I hadj before experienced. I found however that, to quit Paris would be extremely disagree able to her; and besore the fear of making
C 9> ]
ing her uneasy every other consideration vanished. I therefore thought of a middle course, which was, to hire an house or lodging in the immediate neighbourhood of Paris, from whence we might be Soon in town when buiiness or pleasure called us. To this she assented, and we fixed on Chaillot; after which Manon went back to her house, directing me to wait for her at the little gate of the Thuilleries; whither she returned to me in less than an hour in an hired coach, in which was the Servant who waited on her, and Several large trunks, containing her deaths, jewels, and linen..
%
We hastened immediately to Chaillot, and lodged that night at the inn, intending to employ the next day in Seeking an house or elegant lodging. We Soon found one that was exastly to our mind: and there we began to live So happily, that I
believed
(
E 92 ]
believed all my Sorrows were at an end. The softness and sweetness of manon’s temper, her attention to the slightest of my wishes, and the charms of her wit and vivacity, made me forget, in the deliriiini of the tenderest love, all I had Suffered ‘ and all I had Sacrificed.
I
\
As we had now acquired a little more experience, I determined to consider well the Sum we possessed, and regulate oiir ’
e
expenses accordingly. Sixty thousand francs, though a considerable Sum, were not enough for the demands of alonglisey! nor were either of us much disposed to ► straighten ourselves in point of expense.
w
ceconomy was by no means a virtue which either Manon or I possessed: : my mode ’ of calculating, in Speaking of our future manner of liseto her, was thus: Two thousand crowns a year, Said I, will maintain us handsomely while we continue at Chaillot,
where
9
/
[ 93 ]
where we 'Will live with simple elegance. Our principal expenses will be for a coach and public places. As you love the opera, we will go thither twice a week: as to play, 'we will determine to lose no more than two pistoles at a sitting. By these regulations our Sixty thousand francs may last nine or ten years, during which time it is almost impossible but that Some event must happen that will Set us en tirely at ease. My Sather is not young, and it is improbable he should live So' long; at his decease I shall poffess a fortune that will place me beyond the malice of my destiny.
This management was not the most absurd of my plans, had we been’ wise enough to have adhered to if. But our resolution did not hold out above a month, Manon was passionately fond of dissipation, I was passionately fond of her, and
every
ft
(
I 94 ]
every moment new temptations to expense arose; while on my part, far from regret ting the profusion with which she threw away money, I Iludied to anticipate her wishes, and to procure for her whatever she liked.
Our residence at Chaillot now began to be disagreeable to her. Winter was j approaching, everybody was going back to Paris, and the country became deserted and melancholy. She proposed that we should return, and establish ourselves there; but to that I had numberless reasons for not consenting: to gratify her however in some meafurcj I agreed to take a ready furnished apartment, where we might occasionally pafs the night; for as we were sometimes late at public places, we found it inconvenient to return home to Chaillot at those hours, which was her principal plea for desiring to change
our
t
%

[ 95 ]
f ^ *
our residence. In pursuance of this Scheme, which was the very worst I could have adopted, we engaged a furnished lodging, and frequently pasted the night
there; but it Soon was the remote occasion
»
undoing, by entangling us in con nestions and events, from the consequences of which we could never aster recover.
I
A
Manon had a brother in the guards many years older than herself, who most’ unhappily for us lodged in the very street where we took this temporary apartment.
He Saw his lister at the window, and came without ceremony to Speak to her. This man was rude, brutal and uneducated, without honour. Sentiment or pity; and knowing Something of his sister’s adventures, he began by loading her with every term he could imagine of the groffest abuse, It happened fortunately for lis
both
«
[96]
both that I was gone out when he came, as I was not at all disposed to Suffer Such an instilt tamely. When I returned to Manon, which was a few minutes after he had left her, I Sound her in tears and con llernation; and on inquiring the cause, she related to me what had happened, Her entreaties only prevented my going' out instantly in Search of him: but while
r
we were yet debating he returned. I did not however know him; and Manon, ter rined at the indignation I had expreffedj against him, had not courage to tell me, j I received him therefore as a stranger, while he, assuming an air of pleasantry, told Manon he .was come to beg her pardon for bis violent behaviour. Then addressing himself to me, he Said he had believed at first that his Sister lived in a 4 disorderly and debauched way, which had excited his displeasure, but having heard
from my Servants who I was, he had
Since
[ 97 3
Since inquired my charaster, which inquiry turned out So much to my advantage, that far from meaning to renew his reproaches to his Sister, he was come to offer us his Services, and to assure' us that nothing would make him happier than to live in friendship with us, Ridiculous and affronting as I thought this Speech, I Saw the eyes of Manon brighten on it, and a look from her was always enough to determine me: I theresore gave him a civil answer, and accepted of his offered hand; after which we detained him to dinner, and he Soon became So familiar, and So persestly at his ease, that when he Sound we intended to return that evening to Chaillot he desired to accompany us, and took his place in our coach with great composure.
From that period he became much more master of my house than I was my
F Self.
\
[ 98 ]
Self. He honoured me with the appell tion of brother; and on the strength of the relationship, made iise of our house and our purse as his own; bringing his friends (who were far from being very desirable acquaintance) to be entertained at our expense. He went still farther, and not only engaged us to pay Several debts for him, for large Sums, but ordered himself fashionable clothes and handfotne linen, the bills for which he Sent to us to be discharged. To all these impositions I foi Some time Submitted rather than give pain to Manon, and I affested not to know
I
the Sums he from time to time drew from
/ >
her. Sometimes, indeed, when he had s
\
Successful run of play, he had the conscience to return her a part of what h had taken; but our whole fund was too] inconsiderable to Support long the addition of his dem.ancis to expenses before too great. I determined therefore to
o
Speak
C 99 ]
Speak to him plainly, when an accident intervened which precluded the necessity of my remonstrance, and plunged me into an abyss of diltress and wretched ness.
We had pasted a day and a night at Parish as we osten did, when the following morning the Servant, who on these occa stons was left at Chaillot, came early to tell me, that in the night the house had by Some accident taken fire, which was with the utmost difficulty extinguistied by the neighbours. I asked her if our furniture had Suffered, and if we had lost anything? She told me that the crowd, which had pressed in under pretence of assisting, had been So great, that she could answer for nothing, and that all the doors had been broken. jviy heart Sunk when I thought of the cashet I had left in my closet, in which the whole of our little
F 2 fortune
I
C 100 3
fortune was deposited, I ran to Chaillot, Alas! howfruitlelsly! The casket was gone, and we were reduced at once to the most deplorable poverty. I then Selt how much it was possible to love money, with out being avaricious. I foresavr all the' evils to which this cruel loss would expofei me, and 1 was struck with it as .with the hand of death. Ah! exclaimed I, I shall lose again all that makes life worth my
ft
care; for I know that Manon, all tender and attached to me as she is in prosperity, will shrink from poverty and adversity: : will again Sacrifice me to the pleasures of affluence, which So many will be ready to offer her, and nothing will aemain for me but eternal despair.
I
these reflestions were So dreadful, that I hesitated whether it was not better to end all my Sufferings by a voluntary death, than to live in the wretchedness 1 Saw preparing
[ loi ]
paring fnr me. But then, as is always the case in these dreadful paroxisms of passion, it occurred to me that I should first inquire if no resource remained; and an idea presented itself that a little Softened the anguish of my mind. I thought it not impossible to conceal from Manon this heavy loss, at least for a little while; and hoped that chance or good fortune might in the interim furnish me with the means of Supporting her in the way she now lived in, I thought. Said I to myself, when I considered the resoursc we have now lost, that twenty thousand crowns would Suffice us ten years; let me suppose those ten years already gone, and that none of the events I thought probable, had happened in my family. Had it been so, how did I then mean to have Supported myself? In truth I know
not: but whatever I should have done
%
then,, I may do now. How many are
F 3 there
I
[ 102 ]
there who live at Paris, whose resources
nobody knpws; and who, without any
advantages of person or understanding,
owe their fortune entirely to themselves.
Nature, to make amends for the injustice
of fortune, Srequently bestows genius and
talents on those to whom she has denied,
or from whom she has withdrawn her
favours; by which the different ranks of
men are brought nearer an equality : and
the poor, by administering to the vanity
%
or pleasures of the rich, partake of the advantages of affluence.
I
j
By these arguments I tried to persuade myself that I might find Some method to Support Manon; and for her there was nothing I would not have undertaken. I became in a short time more composed; and I determined to consult Monsieur l.dscaut, the brother of Manon, as to
what course of lise I ought to enter upon
in
»
[ >03 ]
I
in my present situation. He was per sestly acquainted with the town; and on Several occasions I had Seen enough of his manner of life, to be convinced that it V as not from any property he possessed, Of from the king’s pay, that his appearance and expenses were Supported. I went to him, and related to him what had happened, showing at the same time my purse, containing only about twenty pistoles, which was now become all my fortune; and I ashed him, whether on a view of my circumstances he thought it most advisable for me to shoot myself through the head, or wait till famine and despair put an end to my existence.
He answered with the utmost eoolhess, that Sora young fellow like me to shoot myself was very absurd, and what no lad of Spirit would think of; and as to dying of famine and despair, anybody might
F 4 be
[ 104 ]
be reduced to that, who was So Scrupiss lous as to refuse the means which his own talents or connestions might siir nish him with; and that if I would consider what I was fittell for, I might affiire myself of his advice and assistance. All this is very vague, monsieur l’ef caut, Said I; my wants require an instant Supply, or how am I to meet Manon? Apropos, answered he, of Manon; your inquietude is about her, and yet in her | alone you are possessed of the means to finish all your Solicitudes: nay liiore, her beauty is a resource to maintain her, you and me. The rage and indignation I found ristng in my heart was with difr culty restrained while he continued to tell me that if I would Sollow his advice he would engage before evening to divide a thousand crowns with us; Sori am acquainted, Said he, with an old nobleman,
So liberal and So amorous, that he would
not
[ 105 ]
not fail to offer any price for the good graces of So handsome a girl as my lister.
Stop, Mbniieur ltscaut! cried I; this is discourse to which sh cannot listen, and which I beg never to hear repeated. I had indeed conceived abetter opinion of your friendship for me, and little shonght to have been affronted with So disgraceful a proposal, He laughed at my warmth; and with the most disgusting assurance told me, that Since his sister had once broken through the laws osher Sex, (though in favour of the man in the world for whom he had the greatest esteem) he thought any Suture, violation of decorum a matter of the most perfest indifference; and bad reconciled himself to her with no other view than to share the profits of her prostitution.

if, he was now So necessary to me that! dared not express the horror and detestation he inspired me with; and theresore, with ■a forced smile, told him that this was an

expedient to be thought of only at the last extremity. I besought him to consider of Some other, and he then proposed to me to become the penlioner of Some rich dowager, to whom my age and figure might recommend me: but this plan was hardly less repugnant to me than the other, and I inquired of him what he thought of play? The gaming table, answered he, is certainly a great resource, but it requires to be well understood. To undertake to play on only the. common chances, is indeed to complete or perpetuate your ruin.
You can never make anything of it, iin^

The best thing I can think of for you;, continued he, is the Association; but I much doubt whether the confederates will accept a member of your age: however I will See what is to be done. So Saying, he lest me, having offered me his pnrse if I stiould have occasion for it, which indeed was more than I expested of him; but I. did not accept it, and requested only that he would not acquaint Manon with the lost.
I had Sustained, nor with the Subjest of our conversation,, which he readily promised.,
t left him in greater uneafiness than I had met him, and heartily repented having. I entrusted him with my painful Secret. ILIAD obtained nothing by it which he might not equally have done for me withoui this imprudent confidence. Nor could i.at all depend on his promise of Secrecy, : on the contrary, I had every reason to apprehend
that he would disclose it, to indvice Manon,
to
C *08 ]
to quit me; and in the view of making his advantage of her charms, prevail on her to Seek the protestion of a richer and more fortunate lover.
these ideas threw me back into all the agony of mind from which I had just recovered. I then thought of writing to my Sather, and under pretence of feeling new regret for my indiscretions, Solicit a Supply of money, to enable me to return home: but to this expedient I dared not trust, when I remembered that notwithstanding all his affestion for me, and the tenderness of his nature, he had dofely confined me six months for my first fault; whence it was but too probable, that for a Second error, and after all the noise occasioned by my flight from St. Sulpice, I should be treated with infinitely greater 'rigour, if I put myself into his power again.

Amidst a chaos of perplexing thoughts, one at length occurred to me that I was astonished I had not recollested Sooner; which was to apply to my friend Tiberge, from whose unfailing friendship I believed I should obtain immediate assistance. The triumph of virtue is here worthy of remark. Certain as I was that Tiberge would disapprove my manner of life, yet So strong was rny reliance on his honour and generosity, that I knew I ran no risque by entrusting him with my neces ' Sities, and the place of my abode; and that although he might not have it in his power to assist me; I should meet with compashon and Sympathy from him. The heart that shrinks from the generality of mankind, opens itself before goodness and probity like his, as a flower which closes before the chilling wind, expands to the genial influence of the vernal Sun.

In
[ 110 ]-
In pursuance of this hope of assistance,
I determined to See Tiberge before evening; and immediately, returned home to write a few lines to him, in which I destred he would meet me at a time and place I named to him; and entreated Secrecy and discretion, as absolutely necessary in the present state of my affairs. The joy I felt in the hope of Tibergest assistance effaced the traces of uneastness which Manon must otherwise have perceived on my countenance. I mentioned to‘ her the accident that had happened at Chaillot as a trifle which ought not to disturb her;
I
and as. she was always best pleased to be at Paris, she was not Sorry to hear me say we would continue there, till Some slight reparations were made that the fire rendered necessary.
About an hour aster I had Sent my [ letter I rec^jived tiberge’s answer, who
prpmised

C ]
promised to meet me at the place I had appointed. I went thither with the utmost impatience, though not without a sensation of shame and reraorse at appearing before a friend whose very looks
1
must reproach me for the Saults and disorders of my lise. But the gentleness and candour of his charaster, and the pressing necessities of imanon, gave me confidence to meet him. The place of assignation was the garden of the palace royal. Tiberge was there before me; and as Soon as he Saw me, approached with, open arms, and with tears in bis eyes. I meet you, Said I, my dear Tiberge, with confusion; and I feel, a lively Sorrow for my ingratitude
towards you. Tell me, I conjure }oii, if it is yet permitted me to call you my friend, after having So much deserved to lose your
/
esteem and affestion? He answered m e, with an air of concern, that nothing could ever make him dilbwii tar t tide; and that if I permitted him to Say So, my misfortunes
£ II ]
tunes and errors had redoubled his regard
for me; a regard, continued he, which I must still cherish, notwithstanding the pain it gives me, for pain I must feel in contemplating your unhappy infatuation. I am as one who Sees a beloved objest dying of a diiease to which he is not Siif sered to apply a remedy. A deep Sigh here escaped me. Ah! ray friend, cried, I, your cornpassson must be indeed great if it equals the torture that I Suffer at this liioment. I almost dread to discloseto you from whence it arises that I am just now So wretched; but So completely am I miserable, that you would pity me though you loved me less than you do.
He desired I would recount to him what had happened since I So precipitately and imprudently left St. Sulpice. I gave him, without diffimailation, a detail of all that had pasted; and far from disguising or
Softening
✓
[ »3 ]
Softening my errors, I confessed them in their utmost extent, and Spoke of my fatal passion vrith all the ardour with which,
I felt it. I represented myself as one under the influence of an overruling des tiny, from which I could not escape; but which muss; overwhelm a wretch for whom all the endeavours of honour, duty and friendship had been exhausted in vain.
I drew So lively a pisture of the (fate of my mind, and the agonies of Sear and despair I had felt only two hours before, and which I muss: again feel if my friend abandoned me as I had already been
t
abandoned by fortune, that poor Tiberge was extremely affested, and compassion gave him emotions almost as strong as my uneassness gave me. He repeated the most friendly assurances of assistance, but Spoke as if my parting with Manon was a measure which in my present circumstances I certainly meant
to
[ "4 ] •
to adopt. To undeceiye him at once as to that, I told him plainly that it was that very Separation I dreaded as the greatell evil that could befall me; and that I would Suffer the lass: extremity of misery, nay the most cruel death, rather than Submit to what would be the most insupportable of all misfortunes.
If you revolt. Said Tiberge, at a proposal which I consider as a preliminary to your return to reason and to happiness, tell me, dear Charles, what I can do for you? I dared not Say that it was with his purse she could assist me; but at length he comprehended it, and told me he understood me.
For Some moments he stood Silent and pensive, deliberating how to at. To what a Situation do you reduce me, Said
V
he. Shall I refuse you, my friend, the
only
I
C >15 3
only Succour you will accept, or shall I violate all my duty by granting it. ' Alas! in doing' the latter do I not encourage you to persevere in a course of iise ruinous to your principles, and deftrustive of your charaster? But yet, continued he, it may be that the unhappy situation of your affairs, the dread of indigence, and the tumult of contending passions, leave you not at liberty to conquer this unhappy malady of the Soul. A mind ill at ease listens not to the voice of honour, and knows not how to regain a path once lost. I will therefore, niy unfortunate friend, find means to assist you, but let me make this condition with you; which is, that you shall tell me where
you are to be Sound, and Suffer me to
%
try what I can do to recall yon once more to reputation and tranquillity. I agreed with pleasure to this reasonable request, and implored his companion for
his

his poor friend, the peculiar malignity of whose fate made the Sublime attachment of Such a Soul as his of no avail in Saving him from misfortune and wretchedness.
We now went together to his banker’s, who on his note advanced an hundred pis toles, for he was by no means able to furnish me with it himself in ready money. I have already observed he was not rich from his family; and tho’ his benefice was worth a thousand crowns a year, yet this being the firsl: year he possessed it, he had received no part of the income: it was therefore on the credit of the growing profits that he made me this advance, I felt
most truly his extraordinary generosity; So deeply indeed did it for the moment affect ^ that I could not but confider with re morse my unjultifiable condust, and the unworthy captivity in which I was held. This idea, and a sense of the mean and
wretched
C h7 ]
wretched part I was asting, made me wish to throw off my chains; but the moment I Saw Manon all these reflestions vanished: a Smile, a look from her, would I verily believe have drawn me out of paradise; and while I gazed on the most: perfest and most enchanting of all heaven’s works, I wondered how I could ever think of ceasing to adore an objest So irresistibly charming.
Beautiful however as her form was, her mind had Some unhappy Singularities that were of the most distresting consequence to me. Without the Smallest taint of avarice, she could not for amomentsustain the dread of wanting money. pleasure and dissipation were absolutely necessary for her; and as long as she could be amused, she never troubled herself about the means by which her amusements were procured; nor bestowed a thought on the future, while the present was pashng away agreeably. And
though[
[ 3
\
tho’ Ihe professed to love me ardently, and prlfifehed that every other man was indifferent to her, I had but too much reason to fear that all her tenderness for me would be unequal to Support her against the dread of want. With a moderate fortune, I believed she would have preferred me to all the world; but I believed also, that she would abandon me for some new De Beaumanoir, when I should have nothing to offer her but the homage of a tender heart. On Some lovers this temper would have perfested a cure, but on me it had another effest, and determined me to circumscribe my own expenses, rather than not Support her’s; and not to refuse her even the most Superfluous gratifications, tho’ I denied mysels the necessaries of lise.

The coach that we kept was a Subjest
of greater alarm to me than all the rest;

we could pay the weekly cost: of the coachman and horses. l.dscaut knew I h .d borrowed an hundred pistoles of a friend, and to hirn I imparted my uneasiness about the coach. He then renewed our conversation on the Subjest of play, and told me that if I had now an inclination to try my fortune, it would be proper to introduce myself to the association by Spending an hundred or an hundred and fistv livres in making an entertainment for them; wshich he thought, together with his recommendation, would ensure my reception among them on a respestable Sooting,, and enlist me as a novice of Some consequence among the Chevaliers d’industrie.
Great as my distike was to become a member of Such a Society, all my Scruples vanished before the dread of lostng Manon, and I agreed to his proposal. l.dscaut presented me to them the next evening as
a relation
J
[ 1^0 ]
a relation of his own, desirous of beconi' ing one of their party; and added that I should have a strong inducement to profit by their inftrustions, as Sew had So much occasion for the favours of fortune. But to convince them that my necessities were not Such as a gentleman ought to blush at, he told them I had ordered a Supper, at which I requested their company: They accepted the invitation, and I entertained them at an expense I could ill afford. My figure and address were the Subjest of their warmest praises. They told me how much they relied on the proficience of so promising a pupil; particularly as being quite unknown, young, and with a countenance remarkably open and ingenuous, nobody could possibly suspest that I belonged to a Society who lived by the unguarded and unprastised players.

At the "nd of Some weeks, my fortune was Ib Siir

prizingly amended, that I found mysetf master of considerable Sums, besides those ‘ which I honestly paid to the associates as their share of the booty, I then no longer dreaded to discover to Manon the loss we
A
had Sustained at Chaillot; and to convince her she had no reason to lament it, I hired an handsome furnished house, and put our establishment on the Sooting of a family in affluence and Security.
%
During this time Tiberge made me frequent vistts; and there was no end to the
f
lestures he gave me. He unceasingly represented to me that my present way of iise was ruinous to my morals, my reputation, and my fortune. I heard him with patience condemn a conduct I felt not the least inclination to alter. I knew he really meant well, and could not be angry at his zeal, which however began to be very fatiguing to Manon. Sometimes in her
presence

ftreience I laughed at his Solemn remon itrances, and exhorted him not to be more Scrupulous than were numberless billiops and other of the clergy, who made no difficulty of keeping a fat benefice with a fair mistress; and showing him the fine
I
eyes of Manon, would laughingly ash him if an attachment to So charming an objest could at my age be a crying Sin,
Tiberge in his turn had patience with she; and still hoping that his persevering friendship might h^lp to open my eyes, he Sacrificed even his rigid attention to appearances, and continued for Some weeks to frequent my house, disreputable as it was. But when at the end of that time he found no hopes of an alteration, but that notwithstanding my expensive establishment my riches Seemed to encrease; when he found that I enlarged my style of living, and purstied with redoubled eagerness

An opportunity Soon offered; and he .began by expressing the concern it gave him to See me.so resolutely plirfuc a, way of life, offensive to Heaven, and dishonourable towards the .world; and which must inevitably plunge me into miseries, which, J must Sustain without the consoiation of pity, andin the dreadful reflestion of having deserved them.

it is impossible. Said, he, that the money which Supports all this profusion can be honestly acquired: you have gained it by illegal and dishonourable methods, and by Such be assured you will lose it. Indeed the most dreadsul punishment Heaven could inflist would be to Suffer you to enjoy it in tranquillity. All my

weak, unhappy friend! May your Sudden wealth fade like a dream, and may you again awaken, poor and friendless, from this, wretched intoxication, from which I fear nothing but the iron hand of adver sity will rouse you! then' you will find me again ready to love and Serve you, as 1 have ever willingly done till now; but here Ishreak off. all commerce with you; detesting and flying from the contagion of Successful wickedness, and feeling my regret and Sorrow for your infatuation alleviated only by the consciousness. of having done, my duty in endeavouring to recall you to yours.
After this Severe remonstrance he arose to quit the room. I would have stopped him; but Manon, who was present, desired me to let him go, for a tedious eng

«
by the cant he had heard at St. Sulpice, His discourse however did not wholly Sail of effest: chagrin and disquiet remained for a while strongly marked on my countenance; but a kiss from Manon, who Smiled in my face, and proposed Some
f
new Scheme of pleasure to dissipate the effest of this apostolic harangue of my Sather confessor, as she laughingly called Tiberge, Soon drove him and all he had said out of my mind.
We lived at this time in Such a constant Succession of amusements, that I had little time and less inclination to reflest. My success daily encreased my riches, and
9
with it our attachment Seemed if possible to encrease also. Venus and Fortune never
i
had two happier Subjests than we then were. I was tempted to deny that a world where I possessed So much happiness, could
.D be
[ 127 1
e a vale of tears; and forgetting every Sing I had before Suffered, became ari' picurean in principle as well as in prac ce. But all this was not to last: bitter ess and anguish were following close upon s, and all .dberge’s prophecies on the
i
oint of being fulfilled. I had won sh such money at play, that I began to dnsider how I should place it out to the est advantage:, but I deliberated instead
O
f asting, and as had been my custom in 11 the reasonable Schemes I had ever }rmed, I put it off still it was too late.
I
I had hired a valet de chamber, who 'as well acquainted with the Source from hich I procured money, and was indeed )o much entrusted: manon’s maid, who as also much in her mistressst favour, nd as much relied upon, was a very retty girl, and my man took it into is head to be in love with her; the cong.

iequence of which was, that they, {© procure themselves money to enable them to marry and ellablifh themselves, contrived a, Scheme to rob us; which they executed with So much success, that we never asterwards could recover from the inconveniences it threw us into. To rob us indeed was easy enough, considering the thoughtless and unguarded way in which we lived,
. V
One evening after the play we Supped with l’escaut, and returning home about midnight, I called as usual for my valet de chamber, and Manon for her woman; the other Servant told us they had both been gone out Some hours, having first Sent away Several trunks and packages, as they Said, by my orders. I instantly guessed at part of the truth; and on going into my apartment I found the locks of my bureau had been forced, my noses

and money taken, together with my clothes and linen, of which they had not lest me even a change. Before I could recover from the shock occasioned by this discovery, Manon came to me to tell me that the. Same plunder had been practised in her apartment. It was with difficulty I acquired Sufficient command of myself to resrain from cries and exclamations: but the apprehension of communicating my despair to Manon, made me af j fed a calmness I was far from feeling. Oh! cried I, be not So uneasy; Some dupe at. the hotel de transyivanie shall make us amends. But Manon was not to be
So easily consoled; and her distress and

consternation overcame every effort I could make to restore her courage and my own. We are lost, Said she; ruined beyond resource! In effect I felt this to be too true : we were at once stripped and pennyless.

Not knowing what else to do, I ran back to l.dseaut, who advised me to go immediately to the Lieutenant of the Police, and the Grand Provost of Paris. I did So, but I only encreased the calamities which Surrounded me; for besides that the inquiries of these officers of jus tice were of no avail, I gave ltscaut, who went directly to his Sister, time and opportunity to talk to her, and to prevail on her to consent to a project which made me more wretched than my loss.
He told her that if ffie would Suffer him to introduce her to Monsieur Gevres de Malleville, a man as celebrated for debauchery as for his riches, and whose liberality was well known where he was attached, that she would be immediately placed in a more brilliant Situation than any she had ever enjoyed; and probably obtain from this Superannuated libertine, a
Settlement
iji }
Settlement which would put her out of the reach of the pcrverse destiny that with me Seemed to pursue her.. In a word,, he Said So much, that in the agitation of her Spirits She consented to enter into his views; and. this honourable resolution was taken besore my return, the execution, of it being delayed only till the next day, to give l’escaut an opportunity of apprizing De Malleville of the ladyst Savourable Sentiments. When I got to my house, after my fruitless application to the Police, I found this kind brother waiting Son me; but Manon was gone to bed,, leaving a message for me with the. Servants,, that being extremely Satigued, she desired to remain alone in her own apartment.

L’efcaut,, after offering me the loan of some pistoles, which I accepted, quitted
me also, and 1 went to bed at Sour o’clock;

I Sell asleep, and when I awoke I found it near eleven o’clock. I arose, impatient to inquire how Manon had pasted the night; when, on my Summoning the Servants, they told me that about ten o’clock her brother had called, and taken her out in a fiacre. Though I was not much, pleased with this party, and the mysterious! manner of her going,, I made an effort to check na suspicions. I took, up a book, and passed an hour and more with a Sorced patience: but disquiet and un easiness got the better of me; I could Sit. still no longer; and going to the window,
I watched every coach, in hopes of Seeing it stop; and listened to every Sound.’ then Sickening with anxiety, I began hastily to traversesthe apartment, considering whether
I Ihouldgo out in Search of her, tho’ I knew

not where to go. At length, as I walked with uneasy steps by sher toilet,! Saw a. letter lying among the boxes and things Ihe had jest there : I Snatched it up: it was her hand, addrelsed to me.. trem bling^with impatience, I tore it open and
read these words:

“I Solemnly protest to you, my dear “Chevalier, that you are the only be loved of my heart; and that it is you “only I am capable of loving. But “alas! my dear Des Grieux! in the Situa“ “to which we are reduced, fidelity “would be a ridiculous virtue. Love “will fly from want, and amidst hunger and poverty I Should forget to adore “you, and deplore the unhappy destiny “that united us.

After having read this extraordinary letter,. I remained in a Hate of mind hard to be described. Grief, rage, jealousy I and shame, contended with equal violence in my distracted bosom. Ah! it had been happy for me, if love had not yet had a greater influence there, and predominated even in the chaos of painful sensa tions.

I came not only to tsll^ you where She is, but to acquaint yon with the good Sortune that awaits ycu. I desired an immediate explanation. He told me that Manon being unable to bear the thoughts of in

He took care not to tell me that he had himself advised her to Seek this acquaintance, and that the whole Scheme was his own. I carried Manon thither

this morning, continued ltscaut; aiid monsieur de Malleville was So charmed with her, that he immediately invited her to accompany him to his country house,

for which he was. just Setting out, and where he will pass Some days. Foreseeing, my dear Chevalier, how, advantageous this connexion, might, become Tor yon,
I took care to tell him that my Sister had met with great Ioffes; and from the hints I gave him, he began by making her a present of two hundred pistoles, which I affected to consider as well enough Sora beginning, but gave him to understand that in Suture she would greatly need his friendship in pecuniary matters, shaving undertaken to provide for a younger brother, who on the death of our parents had been lest wholly to her and to me; and that therefore if he Sound Manon worthy his protection, he would doubtless prevent her Seeling any unhappiness in

I followed her, and fdund her drowned in tears, of which I inquired the caiife. How shall I live, Said she, if I am to See you unhappy? Since we met, you have have hardly deigned to Speak to me: you receive my caresses with coldness and ill humour, and you are going to forget to love me.

Hear me, Manon, answered I. My heart
4
I own is torn in pieces. I Speak not of the alarm into which your abrupt departure, after having passed the night in another apartment, occasioned me; but do you believe that I am So lost to all icnse of my own honour, as to be easily reconciled to the abandoned life you would have me lead? What a character am I to personate? How mean and degrading the Situation to
which
t *4; ' I
which you would reduce me? I shill ffay nothing of my family and my honour; both are now nothing to me: but how inconsistent is the life you would have me lead, with the warmest and tenderest pas sion that ever possfefled the hiiman heart. Yet you Sacrifice me, you leave me, and i — Hold, Chevalier! cried she, interrupting me; these reproaches are ■ useless; they pierce my heart, and cannot mend our Sortune. I See what hurts you, and I relinquish my Scheme, stnce it cannot be executed without making you miserable. Leave me only time to receive the presents that my old gallant is to bring me this evening, and I promise you to quit him directly. He has hitherto nothing to boast of, unless of having kisted my hands an hundred times; it is but reasonable he should pay for that Savour; and considering his age and his riches, the pearl necklace and other presents he has
H promised
t 146 ] 1
promised me, together with half the annual pension, which he is to bring this evening, is not at all too much. I was much better pleased at the disposition she showed to quit her antiquated lover than at the advantage she proposed to make of him. We called in l.dscaut to insorm him of our determination, at wlsidi he failed not to murmur: but the thoughts of five or six thousand livres in ready money, which he hoped to divide ' with us immediately, reconciled him to the project; and after a Sew objections, he consented to all his filler proposed; which was, that we should Sup together with the old gentleman, for two reasons; one was, that she might enjoy the ridiculous Scene which my pretended Simplicity would produce; and the other, that the old libertine might not be alone with her. We agreed, that aster Supper lshscaut and I would retire, and that when De
Malleville
I >47 3
•ft
Malleville went to his apartment, Manon, ’ instead of following him, should rejoin ns
in a coach in which we were to wait for
%
her.
The hour of Supper arrived, and southeast Malleville did not make us wait for himj l’escaut and his lister received him in the parlour, where the first compliment she received from her enamoured Swain, was a necklace, ear rings, and bracelets of fine pearl, worth above a thousand crowns. He then counted out to her, in shining Louis dshrs, the Sum of Sour thousand four hundred livres, which was the moiety of the pension he had agreed to allow her yearly. He seasoned his present with an infinite number of compliments in the taste of the last age; and Manon could not refuse him a few kistes, which seemed to give her a kind of right to the gifts
H 2 she
t 148 3 S
she was receiving, for which she never irb tended to make any other return.
As Soon as Manon had disposed of her acquisitions in her closet, l’escaut came to introduce me to De Malleville; and ■gravely leading me by the hand towards him, bid me make a bow. I took care to

make one down to the ground, with the ' airos a boy who learns to dance. excuse bis awkwardness, monsieur, Said i/escaut, be has yet Seen nothing of the world, and has, as you See, not profited by the air of Paris the little while he has been in it; but time and observation will make him quite another thing: then turning to me, you will have, continued he, the advantage of often Seeing monsieur Gevres de malle ville, to whom I have now the honour do introduce you: you must endeavour to form yourself on So excellent a model. The ancient beau Seemed not at all to susped
the
[ h9 1
the game we were playing; but believing" me to be the raw boy I personated, Seemed pleased with my Simplicity, and tapping me on the cheek, told me I was a pretty lad, and he hoped I should take care of myself at Paris, which was a bad place for young people; lshscaut assured him f was naturally So grave and steady, that I thought of nothihg but becoming a priesh I think him like Manon, Said De Malleville; he has very much her air. Oh dear! yes Sir, answered I, my sister Manon and r are reckoned very much alike, and no
wonder; fiace we are So nearly related
«
and I affure you I love my Sister Manon like another Self.
All our conversation was nearly in this style: and Manon, who was the most de^ termined gigler I ever knew, was Several times on the point of spoiling all by bursting into fits of laughter, which when she
H 3 could.
t o 3
could not wholly conquer she endeavoured to. excuie I and the old man was too much taken up with her beauty, to criticise her behaviour very narrowly.

When it was time to retire, l’escaut and I took our leave, and De Malleville went to his chamber; but Manon, leaving him for a moment on some pretext which she easily found, ran down to us before we left the door, which we opened silently, and then walked to a coach which waited for us a few doors below, into which we got with all possible expedition, and in a few moments were in a distant quarter of the town.
ft
Tho’ in my eyes this appeared no other than an actual robbery, I did not think it the most Scandalous action of which I had ever been guilty: the money 1 had acquired at play Seemed to me
much
C 15* 1
much more unworthily gained. But were equally unhappy in both; and Providence determined that neither the one nor the other should procure us any durable advantage,
Gevres de Malleville Soon discovered how we had duped him. I know not what measures he took that evening to find our retreatbut he had too much credit and power to permit us to escape him long;, while we, trusting to the immensity of the town, and the distance we were at from the quarter he inhabited, believed; ourselves in the most perfect security. He was however Soon informed where we were; and not only So, but he learned who I was, the lise T had led at Paris, the eonnedion of Manon with '
De Beaumanoir, and the manner in which Ihe had quitted him; in a word, all the
Scandalous part. of our history: and he

thereupon took the resolution of having us arrested, and treated like sharpers and cheats.
#
It was about nine o’clock in the monir ' ing, but we were still in bed, when aa Exempt of the Police, and a party of the Marecfiaustee came into our chamber. They Seized immediately on a casket that contained our money, or rather the money and presents of De Malleville; and having made us rise, and dress, ourselves with the utmost haste, they
conducted us to two coaches which were

in waiting. Into one of them thy put

Manon, and me into the other; and
without any apologies drove me to St.

those only who have experienced a Sudden and dreadful reverse of fortune, dan judge of my distradion and despair!
I was,
I ^53 1
I was torn from Manon, to all appearance: forever; and our guards had the inhumanity to refuse me leave to embrace and Speak a Sew words to her before they dragged her away. With equal cruelty, they were obstinately Silent as to whither I was going, or whither she was carried: and probably it was happy I was ignorant of it; for had f then known the terrible Sat that awaited her, I believe it would have deprived me of my rgason,, if not of my life,
/
My beloved Manon then was thus Snatched from me, and carried to a place which I cannot name without horror even at this distance of time. She, who would have been miftress of the world if all.
i
men had had my eyes and my heart, was Shut up in a dreary cell, alone, where she was every day to fulfil a certain talk of coarse work, on which condition only she

ignorant; while I endured myself many months of close and vigorous imprisonment.
V
The place of my destination I knew not till I Saw myself at the gate of St. Lazare; and.at that moment death would have been preserable to my feelings. I had conceived dreadful ideas of the place; and the horror with which it inspired me, augmented when the guard again Searched my pockets to alsure themselves I carried no offensive weapon. The Superior, who had been apprized of my arrival, appeared to receive me. Father, cried I, no indignity: I will lose my lise
rather than Suffer the flightess: to be of

me. No, Sir, answered the father, none are intended : you will ast: reason ablv, and we shall be well Satisfied with

[' r
each other. He then desired me to follow him up Hairs, which I did without re sstance; the guard still following till we came to an upper chamber, when the Superior made them a stgn to retire..
As Soon as the door was Shut upon us,
I addrested myself to shim.. Well, Sir, I am your prisoner; .what do you intend to do with me? He answered that he was happy to hear ^ me Speak calmly: : that it was his inclination, as well as. his duty, to endeavour at least to reinspire me with those Sentiments of religion and restitude, which the heat of youth, and eager pursuit of pleasure, had made me forget; and that he did not doubt,. but that by a little attention to his advice, and exhortations, I should Soon be restored to my reason, and find even that Solitude capable of bestowing pleasiire and > — — -1 hastily interrupted him: talk not to me, father,

cried I, of pleasure; you know not that the only happiness I am capable of tassing is torn from me. Oh, you are niiftaken,, returned the father, in his turn interrupting me: I know your present attachment; but reason will recover its empire over a young man, well, born,, and well disposed. This answer made me apprehend' he was acquainted with my whole history, and perhaps my, name and family. I desired to know how, far his knowledge of my affairs went He told me he knew all.
This stroke was the crudest I had yet Suffered. A stiower of tears fell from my eyes, and the most frightsul despair took poffestion osmy heart. The thoughts of becoming the ridicule of my acquaintance, and the difgracb of my family,.
covered me with Sname and confiision;

and I passed eight days in a Hate of depres fion, or rather of despair bordering 01^ ‘ madness; being incapable of attending to anything but the opprobium and infamy with which this imprisonment covered me, Even love itself lost a part of its influence and 1 thought less of Manon than of though debasement I Suffered by her means. Grief,. confusion, and regret were the reigning.
'to 00
passions of my Soul, and absorbed for a time every other Sentiment. The deep melancholy in which these cruel reflediona
f
plunged me, interested the Superior in my favour: he even began to apprehend fatal consequences, and thought it necessary to treat me with gentleness and indulgence. He visited me Several times every day; and took me often with him into the garden,, where he gave Scope to his zeal, and spared not pious exhortations and advice, which I received with So much mildness, that he
conceived the utmost hopes of my reforma’; tion.
Your

F 158
Your natural dispofition, Said he, appears to me to be So gentle and good, that Tcannot comprehend how you have been drawn into the vices and disorders of which you are accused.. It is astonishing to me, that with Such a temper you should have given yourself up to a course of life So licentious. It is still more astonishing, that having once been involved in it, and res cued only by force, .you should So will ■ attend to the advice and instrustions, I give you.. If this is the effect of repentance, you are a, i Signal instance of the, ' mercy of God; .if it is owing to your. disposition, I have every reason to hope, that; with Such advantages we shall riot have occasion to keep you here long, before you. will realtume your former regular morals, and be restored to your Samily and your respestability. I was delighted to find the good Sather had this opinion of me. I determined to augment his confidence by a

behaviour

iehavionr conformable to the idea he eemed to have formed of. my charaster;
which appeared the only means to shorten ny imprisonment.

All this however was but pretence : with hame I acknowledge that I studied the nost refined hypocrisy, But the melan* holy hours in which I was alone, I pasted lot in reading, but in lamenting my cruel leftiny, and cursing my confinement and hose through whose means I was confined. When the first shock at finding myself tnown was over, love re astlimed its empire :

I Soon had the pleasure of finding myself entirely established in his affestion; |

and being then convinced he was every way disposed to Serve me, I one day took occasion to ash him if my enlargement depended on him. He answered, that though the power was not absolutely his, yet he hoped and believed, that on the favourable report of my condust during my confinement, Monsieur Gevres de Malleville, at whose instance the Lieutenant of the
0
Police had confined me, would consent to my release, May I not hope, ashed I, mildly, that two months close imprisonment will appear to Monsieur de Malleville, a Sushcient; expiation of the offence I have given hirn? The Superior replied, that if I desired it he would try what was
m
to be done; and I So preflingly entreated him to undertake this good office, that he consented to Set about it immediately.
Two days afterwards he informed me, that his representations had Such effest on Monsieur Gevres de Malleville> that
[ "62 ]
he not only Seemed disposed to restore me to liberty, but had even expressed an inclination to be better acquainted with me, and proposed visiting me in my confinement. Tho’ I did not much enjoy the thoughts of this interview, I was rejoiced at the general tenor of the good father’s
(
report' '

De Malleville in a day or two afterwards came to St. Lazare, and was brought into my room by the Superior, who then left us alone. His manner did not now appear So ridiculous as when I Saw him besore at the Satal Supper which cost me So dear. He talked to me sensibly enough on the disorderly life into which I had been drawn; and I suppose by way of justisying himself for his own loose con dust, Said that though Some. indulgencies were permitted to the frailty of human nature, yet that cheating and deceit, for

which there could be no excuse, were of such evil tendency, and So inimical to society, that they could not be too fe merely punilupd. He Seemed Satisfied with : he attention with which I listened to lim; and I continued to bear with pati: nce his raillery on my relationship [to anon, and on the little chapelles which e had told him I took Such pleasure in naking, and of which he Said I had ertainly made a great number at Sti Azare,
Had he stopped here all had been yell; but he went on to say, that un loubtedly Manon had also had abundance )f time for the Same pious employment It the hospital Though my blood curdled n my veins at the word hospital, I had
* l’hopital General, St. Pelaglo, les Filles Repent?, and there houses at Paris are destined for the reception of women of iffstlutc character
yet
[ >64 ]
yet so much presence of mind as to dessre an explanation. An explanation! Oh ho! cried he; what, you do not know then, that Ihe has been in the hospital these two months, where doubtless she has
edified as much as you have done at St Lazare,
Had I been at that moment afilircd of
, >
eternal imprisonment, or had death itself in its most: horrid form been before my
eyes, I could not have conquered the violent emotion that postestecl me at these words. I threw myself upon him in a transport of rage that deprived me of half my strength; but I had enough to throw him to the ground, where I knelt over him; and he was very near being strangled, when the noise of his Sail, and outcries, which I had hardly left him breath to make, brought the Superior and Several: monks into the room; and they delivered, him from my fury with less difficulty,.
L 165 .]
IS passion had deprived me of my breath ind my senses. Oh eternal justice of Heaven! cried I; shall I live a moment ifter So infamous an event? Again I flew
o
it the inhuinan monster, who had done ivorse than affalstnate me; but they prevented my seizing him, and kept us asunder; while the frenzy of my passion exceeded all imagination.
O
/
An agony of rage So violent, the occa fian of which was quite unknown to them, appeared' So extraordinary, that they continued looking in amaze at each other. While De Malleville was adjusting his wig and cravat, and full of terror, and vexation at having been So ill treated, he ordered the Supeiior to confine me more rigorously than ever, and to punisti me with the discipline given to the most refrastory inhabitants of their houle. No,
Sir, replied the Superior, it is not in that
manner
'f
[ i66 ]
1 ■
manner we can think of condusting oub Selves towards a person of Such high birth as the Chevalier des Grieux: he is so properly behaved, and of manners So gentle, that it muss: be Something very unufiial that has driven him to this extremity with you. This answer entirely disconcerted De Malleville, who went hastily away, muttering that he knew how to make both the Superior and the Chevalier des Grieux Submit to his power. The Monks Sollowed him out; and the Superior being left alone with me, conjured me to tell him immediately the occasion of this unaccountable Scene
Oh, Father! cried I, weeping like a child, conceive the most execrable cruelty! imagine the most inhuman outrage! and you will still be unable to guess at anything So insamous as the injury I have received from that old villain. My heart is
torn
f
. [ 167 ]
torn in pieces: I Shall never recover it.
I will tell you all: you are good and will pity me. I then gave him a Summary detail of my long and unconquerable pas sion for Manon; the flourishing state of our fortune when we were robbed by our Servants; the offers De Malleville had made to my mistress, together with the unsortunate manner in which his amour had ended.
\
Tho’ I kept to the general line of fasts, I own I threw the most favourable light 1
td
could on the parts we had asted. You See, father. Said I, the Source of that extraordinary zeal which De Mallevijle has shown for my reformation; and he has had interest enough to have us shut up to gratify his revenge. I forgive hirn the injuries done to my own person; but my Manon! the dearest part of myfeif! her whom I adore, in the hospitall to hear
that
[ >68 I
shat he has put her there, like the most abandoned and incorrigible of women! oh! it is too much! where shall I find strength of mind to Support myself under the shame and vexation that overwhelms me!
The good father feeing me thus in despair, undertook to console me. He told me he never understood my adventure in the manner I now related it: that he knew 1 had lived in a disorderly manner; but always imagined that Some attachment i to my family, or intimacy with my fathetj had engaged Monsieur de Malleville to take part in my affairs; nay, that De Malleville himself had So explained it to
r
him. But that as what I now told him
y
very much altered the case,, he did. not doubt but that the account he woiildgo and give of it to the Lieutenant of the Police, would immediately procure me my liberty.
The

The father then asked me, why Since (ny family had not occasioned my confine ment, I had not informed them of my Situation, and Solicited their interference to procure my release?? answered that I had been prevented by the vexation Such a disgraceful circurnftance would give my father, and the reproaches it would draw * upon me from all my connestions. At the close of our conversation, he promised to, go instantly to the Lieutenant of the Police, is it be only. Said hcj to prevent Something yet more malicious from Gevres de Malleville, who went from hence in a very ill humour, and who has interest enough to be a very dangerous enemy. I waited his return in the state of mind of a cririiinal who expests his sentence. The idea of Manon at the hospital, brought with it a thousand daggers to my Soul: the accounts I had heard of that dreadful abode occurred to me in all its horrors, and threw me into
[ 1, 70 ]
an agony of mind not to be described. So determined was I to relieve her, that had no other means offered of getting out of St. Lazare, I stiould certainly have fired the. building rather than have been longer ■confined in it. Then I ran over in my mind every possibility of escape, if the Lieutenant of the Police stiould refuse to Set me free; and aster canvassing many different places, Saw none on which I could certainly depend: while I felt too certainly, that to attempt it and Sail would make my captivity yet strister.
/
I thought of every friend on whom I could depend for assistance; but how inform them of my Situation? At length I believed I had Sound one expedient that gave a ray of hope: but besore I had time to digest my plan the Superior returned, and in his countenance I read
.that his embasty had been successless. I
have
C 171 ]
have Spoken, said he, to the Lieutenant of the Police, but my application was too late: De Malleville had prepoisefled him So strongly against you, that he was on the point of Sending me orders to confine you more stristly, and to Subjest: you to harsher methods; but when I related to' him the true state of your case, he seemed very much Softened; and Smiling at the libertinism of old De Malleville, he told me that tho’ your offence was much lessened in his opinion by this explanation, yet you must notwithstanding Submit to six months longer imprisonment; in which, added he, I more willingly consent to gratify Monsteur de Malleville, ^ as Such a penance cannot Sail of having a Salutary effest on the morals ^ of the Chevalier des Grieux. He ordered me, however, to treat you with decency and good manners, of which I assured
I 2 him

V
I 172 3
him you should have no reason to com* plain.
While the good father was Speaking,
I had time to consider that I should only expose myself to the hazard of Sailing in my design, is I expressed too violent a desire for my enlargement. I thereforcj with all the tranquillity 1 could assume, answered, that it was a great alleviation of my missortune to find I possessed his friendship; consoled with which, I must Submit as patiently as I could to a longer; residence at St. Lazare; but that another circumstance in which it was in his power to indulge me, would assist in sostening the hardship of confinement, which was, ' that he would inform a worthy friend of mine, an ecclesiastic of St. Sulpice, where
I
I was, and permit him Sometimes to visit me. This favour the father granted without hesitation, and 1 need not tell you it

vas my friend Tiberge that I meant t »ot that I hoped through his immediate distance to procure my liberty, but I ntended using him as the remote inftru ncnt of mv design, without even his own knowledge..
\
My projest was to write to l’escant,, nd engage our common friends in my escue. The first: difficulty was to convey ny letter to him., Tiberge I was Sure ?old undertake to deliver nothing to he brother of Manon; therefore I con rived to put my letter to him into ano her which I dirested to a very creditable radesman whom I knew; and this I bought Tiberge would carry for me dthout Scruple: As it was absolutely, lecefiary for me to See l.dscaut, I da ired him to come to St. Lazare,. and en [uire for me, in the name of my elder Tother, who might with probability be

[ >7.4 3
supposed to have come to Paris, on hearing of my litliation. The Superior informed Tiberge of my desire to See him,
r
and he came immediately. This valuable friend had not lost Sight of me: he
o
knew my last; adventure, and that I was at St. Lazare; and he was not Sorry for a disgrace that he hoped would be the means of restoring me to reason,
%
Our conversation was held in the most persest: friendship. He wished to know the Situation of my mind, and I opened myself to him without reserve on everything except my design of escaping. Tis not to your eyes, my dear Tiberge, Said I, that I shall endeavour to appear what I am not.

favourably; you See me Such as I left you

3lir months since; always passionately.. love, and always unhappy thro’ the xcess of that Satal tenderness in which I lace my happiness. He answered,. that ie insatuation under which I Suffered my ‘ : ason to be anihilated, was inexcusable: bat tho’ instances were not uncommon, f Sinners, who, intoxicated with the ilie pleasures of. vice,. openly preferred iem to those of virtue, still it was appiness they were attached to,, however allacious their idea of it, and they were t least the dupes of illusion; but to be onvinced, as I was, that the objest: of; iy attachment was fit only to make m@; iiilty and miserable, and yet with my yes open to precipitate myself into the; iilph of crimes and misfortunes, was Lich a contradidion to common-sense, as i^ould disgrace the most inferior under

i4 Ah!
ft

I
«
[ 1/6 ].
Ah! Tiberge! answered I, how easily you vanquish where you are not opposcd, Let me reason a little in my turn. gan you pretend to Say, that what you call the pursuit of virtue is without its pains and mortifications? What else do you call the cross, the punishments, the tortures that tyrants have often inshded on its disciplcs.? Will you assert, vixihihe myfiics, that what torments the body is a benefit to the Soul? You cannot Support Such a paradox. This pursuit then, the satisfaction of which you boast, is embittered with a thousand calamities thro’ which you are to pass to Selicity: if the hope of that Selicity can So Sar influence the imagination as to make you find pleasure even in those Sufferings which you think will lead you to itj, why do you treat as senseless and contradidory a dispofition exactly
ft
resembling what I descrj.be? I love Manon: she alorbe can contribute to my
felicity L
/
[ *77 }
A
felicity: and I hope, notwithstanding tha thorns that have hitherto strewn my path,, to find a time when I Shall live with her ia happiness and affluence. The road I own ia rugged and painsul, but the expectation ofar -- riving Sooner or later at the point I aim at, ^ throws a degree of sweetness into my Sufferings; and one moment past with her over -- pays for all I go thro’, to obtain it. Thus ifi appears to me that my pursuit is as rea? Sonable as your’s, or that the reason is rather the strongest on my Side; stnce the happiness I hope for is near, your’s distant; mine is known and assured, your’s. of a kind unknown, or ascertained only,
through faith.
/
Tiberge was frightened .at this mode of reasoning. He stepped back from me
p
with the air of a man who beholds a noxious insed in his path; telling me, with the most Serious air I had ever Seen
I 5 him
[ 178 ]
him a flu me, that what I said was not only contrary to common-sense, but was a wretched piece of Sophistry, full of impiety and irreligion. The comparison, Said he, which you affect to make between the calamities into which an irregular and disorderly paltion has plunged you, and those which religious and pious persons have endured on account of their faith, is an absurd and an impious idea;
I own, answered I, that the cases may ndt bear a very exact comparison; but take care; it is not on that I lay the weight of my argument. My design was to prove that there is nothing in my attachment contradidory to common-sense; for you ( will allow, that tho’ my happiness may be improperly placed, my conduct tends to obtain it; and if there is any absnrdity in braving pain and danger to gain a
favourite point, you at least are a sharer
in
I
r >79 3"
in the absurdity, ’tis in that light only ^
I Speak of our different pursuits as pn ^ the same Sooting, and I still in Sift that they are So. Do you assert that the rewards which virtue bestows are infinitely Superior to those of love? who shall contradict you? But is it of that we are talking?. No! I Speak of the power which we have to Support in either case, pain and Suffering. We can judge only by experience: how many apostates are there from virtue; how Sew from true love. You will perhaps on your part allege,,., that tho’ there is Sometimes a great degree of pain. self-denial, and uneasmess attends the practice of virtue, yet it is not always So: that the pious are no longer exposed to the danger of being martyrs to their religious principles, and that many virtuous persons live in the utmost tranquillity and content. To which I reply, that neither does love always render his
votaries
[ io ],
votaries unhappy; but that there are those who enjoy all the gifts of fortune together with his fairest Savours, which to susccptible minds includes the greatest of Sublunary blcflings.
The conclusion of my discourse restored tiberge’s good-humour. He allowed that my argument had Something like reason in it; but again he objected to my System, by Saying, Since you must long Since have seen that mademoiselle Manon does not constitute your Selicity, but occasions you to Suffer remorse, disappointment, and dif
«
grace, why not. Since you Say that any degree of pain may be born for an adequate recompense, why not by one great effort disengage yourself from her, in hopes of acquiring by it a right to that Selicity which you acknowledge you believe may exceed the happiness you propose with her. Ah 1 my dear friend! replied I, it is there
I feci
C tsi ]
I feel my deplorable weakness : I See hov/1 should ad, but where shall I find strength to do it? what reason, what rhetoric will make me forget the charms of Manon?
O
God forgive me! cried Tiberge, I believe I am talking to a jansenist. 1 know not what I am, returned I; I hardly know what I ought to be; but I Seel but too sen fibly the force of their System.
This conversation Served to awaken in the breast of Tiberge all his former pity. He Sound more weakness than obstinacy in my unhappy conduct;; his kindness now returning with all its ustial warmth, disposed him'in the Sequel to afford me that share of affectionate attention, without which I must have perished in the utmost misery.
I did not dare discover to him the least lymptom of an inclination to escape from
St. Lazare;
[ 182 ]
Sr. Lazare; but gave him the letter I had
already written and Sealed, desiring him to deliver it to the person to whom it was directed, to whom I easily found a pretence for writing. He carried it pundually; and besore evening l’escaut had received that which was inclosed, directed to him. The next day he appeared at the gate; and Saying, as I had directed, that he was my elder brother, was admitted to my room, I Saw him enter with extreme joy. Let us not lose a moment, Saidi as I Secured the door; tell me first what you know of Manon, and then advise with me on the means of regaining my Sreedom,
He altured me he had not Seen his lister since the evening he parted from us together after our flight from Gevres de Malleville, and that it was not till aster long inquiries he had discovered her fate and
mine; but that as Soon as he knew she
was
C ]
was at the hospital, he had applied there repeatedly for leave to see her, which had been constantly and peremptorily denied him. In regard to your deliverance, continued l.dscaut, it is much less easy than you may suppose. Morizet, Flamarens, and myself, pasted the evening of yesterday in examining the outward walls of your prison; and we fear, that as your apartment looks into a court Surrounded by other buildings, and is besides on the third stair case, it will be difficult, if not impossible to get you from thence by any attempt we could make from without. You must imagine Some expedient from within.
Tis impradicable, answered I; I have examined everything stnce I have been indulged by the Superior with the liberty of walking in the galleries, and am not locked into my room. All the staircafes
are
0 J
are Secured by thick doors, which are caresully Shut night and day, with Such Strength and precaution, that. to. escape Seems almost impoitible. But stay;, a Sudden thoughts strikes me: could you not bring me a pistol, since you pass the porters unse, arched and unsuspeded. Nothing more easy, replied l.dscaut, but who would you kill? I have So little intention to kill any one, Said I, that the pistol need not even be loaded. Bring it tomorrow, and sail, not to be, with our two friends,, oppostte the door of St., Lazare between ten and eleven tomorrow night; I think I Shall be able to join you.
He pressed me to tell him how lin tended to proceed; but I answered that Such an enterprise could only, appear well imagined after it had Succeeded. I then
desired him to Ihorten his visit, to avoid
all
■ E 185 1
all Suspicion, and that he might find nd: difficulty in being admitted the next day. They accordingly Suffered him to enter the Second time as easily as the first:. His air was grave and composed, and nobody would have supposed from his appearance he was otherwise than an honest: man.
As Soon as 1 was furnistied with the instrument with which I hoped to effeduate
I
my release, I hardly doubted of success.
V
The enterprise was hazardous and daring; but of what was I not capable, animated by motives So powersuk' Since I was permitted to walk in the galleries, I had observed, that every evening the porter, aster having locked all the doors, carried the keys to the Superior; Soon after which a profound Silence reigned in the house, which gvinced.that everybody was retired to rest. There was a stone passage which led from my room to, that where the Superior;

r
[ i86 J ■ i
perior lay: my resolution was to Source his keys from him hy threats, and to opem i the doors and go into the street: and hav -- ing thus determined I waited for night.
I
A little past nine o’clock the porter came as usual with the keys : .1 then re -- mained quiet another hour, till the deep silence of the house persuaded me the monks and Servants were asleep; then.; Softly opening my door, 1: went slowly, along the passage, with my candle in one. hand and the pistol in the other, and tapped, gently at the door of the superior’s room, to awaken him with as little noise as posh ble. The Second time 1 rapped he heard me; and Supposing that Some monk was ill, and wanted assistance, he got up to open it. He had however the precaution to ask who it was, and what was wanted?
I answered in a .plaintive tone, and like one in pain, that it was I. Ha! is it you,

my Son? Said the good man, opening the door : what brings you here So late? I went in; and going to the other end of the room with him, I declared to him in a. few words that I would remain no longer at St. Lazare : the night, father, is a convenient time for me to eseape, and I expect of your friendship either that you will open the doors for me or give me the keys that I may open them for myself, This address could mot Sail to stagger him: he looked at me with Surprise : but as I had no time to lose, I told him that tho’ I was. sensible of all his friendship, yet liberty being the most precious of all bleshngs,. and what I was most unjiistly deprived of,
I was determined at all hazards to regain it; and least he should raise his voice for help, I showed him under my waistcoat an infallible argument in Savour of Silence. How! my Son, exclaimed he, starting at Sight of the pistol, would you kill me then

in return for all the kindness I have shown

you? God forbid! my good father! answered I; you will not drive" me to Such a fatal extremity : but I will, I mull be free; and am So determined to attempt it at all risques, that if I fail thro’ your means I cannot answer for the consequence of my rage and despair. But my dear Son, Said he again,, all pale and trembling, what have I done? why should you wish my death? No! no! 1 cried, with yet more impatience, 1 wish not your death, but to procure my liberty— — will hesitate, at nothing— — force me to an. ad of desperation. — Open the doors, and I am your fincerell friend. Then Seeing the keys lay on a table near his bed, I eagerly Seized them, and infilled upon his following me with as little noise as possible. When we got out of the room, I inadeshim go .before me, and open the first: door on the flair ca, fe: as he did it, he, repeated, with, a

Sigh, ah! my Son! from you, who would have Relieved this? No noise, no noise, father, was all my answer,
At length we arrived at a Sort of barrier

which is before the great door of the prison, and I believed myself already Sree »
I was behind the Superior, with my candle and my pistol; but while he was unbarring the grated door, one of the porter’s Servants, who lay in a little room near it, was awakened by the noise, and put his head out at the door of his room to See what was the matter: the father embraced this opportunity to stop me, and unhappily
called to the fellow to Seize me. He was

a strong rascal; and stew at me without he

We walked hastily away. l’escaut ' ashed me if I had not fired the pistol? It was your fault, answered F: why did you bring it loaded Had I not done So, however, I had probably been fixed at St. Lazare for Some years
As Soon as we were out of that quarter
N
of the town, and thought ourselves in Safety, we went to a traiteurs, where I eat heartily aster the meagre Sare I had been kept on at St. Lazare. But far from yielding to the pleasure my newly acquired liberty might have inspired, I resteded with new bitterness on the imprisonment of Manon, and Suffered for her more than
for myself. We must: deliver Manon from
the
[ igi ]
the hospital, Said I to her brother, at all events: I desired my own Sreedom with no other view. You will certainly altift me; and as to mysels, 1 will lose my life
rather than fail.
}
l.dscaut, who did not want sense or Caution, represented to me the extreme •hazard I incurred by entering too precipitately into So rassi an adventure. consider, Said he, how much roise your escape from St. Lazare will make, especially aster the accident that happened on your getting out. The Lieutenant of the Police will certainly Set on foot a ftrid inquiry after you : remember that his Search is not eali iy evaded; and that Situated as you are, it would be of fatal consequence to fall into his power. If therefore you would avoid Something infinitely worse than your imprisonment at St. Lazare, you must: do nothing rastily, but at least let Some days
pass,
9
I >92 ]
■pass, and the first outcry occafiohed by your escape subside, before you attempt tostescue niy sister. This advice was undoubtedly prudent; but it agreed ill with my impetuous temper, and more impetus ous paltion. All I would promise was to pass the next day in his apartment; where he Iluit me up; and I then went to bed, as I greatly wanted repose, and lay till late in the day.
As Soon as I was refreshed by fieep, I began to confider of the means of liberating Manon, whose prison I knew was infinitely more difficult to escape from than mine had been. Force I knew would there be useless: artifice alone could Succeed. But the goddess of Invention herself would have been puzzled how to Set
about it. I shnew So little how to begin, that I was obliged to postpone forming any plan till I could by Some means insorm
myself
L 193 J
iiyself of the interior arrangement of th lospital.
As Soon as returning night made my go'
0
ng out less unsafe, I dessred l’escaut to iccompany me to the hospital, where we entered into conversation with one of the sorters, who Seemed to be an intelligent eilow. I pretended to be a Stranger who lad heard much of the excellent regula dons of the hospital, and I questioned him in the most minute particulars of its [uanagement, and led him from one question to another till we began to discourse of 'he governors, whose names and rank I iefired to be informed of. The answers be made gave me the glympse of an idea that might, I thought, be brought to perfection. I asked if any of the governors; be had named had children? He said that he did not know what family some of them had, but that Monsieur the Count de stj

.drseuil had, a fon, Monsieur de Tiroux, who was about one or two and twenty, and shad often been at the hospital with his father. This was enough : I broke off our conversation; and as we walked towards
s
ih.dscaut’s lodgings I comniunicated to shim the Scheme I had formed.
I I
I imagine. Said 1, that monsieur de .Diroux, rich and of high birth, is in a certain course of pleasures like other young men of his age and situation. He does. not, I imagine, dislike the fair Sex, and will hardly rcsuse his Service in a Iqye affair : I mean to interest him in the libera
w
tion of Manon.' If he is a man of generosity and Sentiment, those motives alone will engage him to assist me; but even if he is less nobly minded, he will at least be moved by the melancholy Situation of a beautiful young woman, and may be itemyjted to befriend her, if it be only in
hopes

Opens of sharing her favours. Therefbre I dll go to hirn tomorrow; and I Seel So avorable a presentiment of success, that I m already much easier than I was. L.DS ^ ant acknowledged my plan to be a good ►ne, and that much might be expected rom it; and consoled with that flattering lope, I pasted the night more easily than ’ had done the preceding one.
In the morning, I dressed myself as well IS my present indigence would allow, and
went in a fiacre to the house of Monsieur(
(
Tiroux. I inquired for the young gentleman, who was at first rather surprised at being addrested by a persed stranger : his countenance and manner ^ were however such as immediately persuaded me I might trust him, and 1 explained in a Sew words the request 1 had to make; and to engage every motive in my Savour, I described the beauty and merit of my mistress Such as
K 2 could
[ 196 ]
'
could be only equalled by the violence of my passion for her. He told me that though
*
had never Seen mademoiselle Manon, he had heard of her extraordinary attractions; at least if it was the Same who had been put into the hospital by Gevres de Malleville. I doubted not but that he was insormed of the part I had taken in that affair; and to gain his confidence by mine, 1 recounted the whole exactly as it happened.
Now Sir, Said I, my life, and what is infinitely dearer to me, the interest of my love, is in your hands. I have no reserves to you : not only because I am assured you are of a noble nature, but because the re semblance of our ages makes me hope our inclinations may also be alike. He appeared affected with this instance of candour, and answered like a man who knew the world, as well as like one possessed of
those[
[ I
hose Sentiments which the world Seldont pies, but often takes away. He did not ffure me he could restore Manon to me, jecause at his age his power and influence : old not be great; but he promised to iroclire me at least a Sight bf her, and to lo his utmost to give her back to my arms.! was. more Satisfied with these moderate. 3romises than, if he had absolutely assfured northeast of succcss: there was a modest diffi lence of his own weight, mingled with his iffurances of Service, which charmed me m.d. I began to hope everything from his mdeavours..
To give me an opportunity of Seeing" Manon was Such a favour as I thought the services of my whole life too little to requite. I expressed to him what I Selt ori' this occasion in So lively a manner, as per stiaded him that ingratitude at least was

not among my vices. We became irnme I
diately on a footing of friendship; without
any other attradion than the natural ten i
dency that one generous open hearted
young man has to love another of the
Same dispofition. But my new friend
carried his attention much farther thaa
most men would have done on So short an
acquaintance: judging as I only So lately
escaped from St. Lazare that my finances
were not in a flourishing state, he offered
me his purse, and even pressed me to
accept it. I refused it, but testified my I
sincere gratitude. ’tis too much. Sir!
Said I; if with this uncommon goodness, j
/ • ' ' you procure me the happiness of Seeing
Manon once more, I shall be eternally
attached to you; but is you restore to

Before we parted we agreed on the time and place where we were to meet again. He had the goodness to delay it no longer than till the next afternoon, i waited for him in a coffeehouse, where at the appointed time he joined me, and we went together, to', the hospital, My knees trembled,, and my breath grew short as I crossed: the court; So that it was with dishculty I Supported myself. Shall I then, Said I,. See again the idol of my Soul;, the object of So much inquietude; of So many tears! Grant me,, oh heaven! strength enough to See her once more, and I think I could die con -- tented,
monsieur de Tiroux; addrested himself to the principals of the house, who with the most officious attention offered him all the civilities in their power. He named the young woman she wanted to See; and
K 4 ' they
■
[ 200 ] •
they directed a Servant to show him the quarter where her chamber was, and to conduct him to it. This man, whose bufiness it was to attend a certain number
, of rooms in one of the wards, walked be—
—
us, with a key of a Srightful Size in his hand. As we went along, I ashed
him how the young person whom we
, ■!
were going to See had pasted her time Since she had been in that dismal place?
He told us, that she had ever been as gentle as an angel, and had never Spoken a harsh or peevish word stnce he had Served her. That during the first:
Six weeks, she had wept continually, but
for Some time she had appeared to be better reconciled to her destiny, and was employed at her work the whole day; ';
and after fulfilling her tash, she read. I *
^ I
inquired if she had been Supplied with

We vere now within a few steps of hec cell, and my heart beat So violently that. I was obliged to stop. Conceiving from. the sensations 1 felt mysels, how violent, her emotion might be if she Saw me sud? denly, I. desired monsieur de Tiroux to. go in first, and prepare her for my arrival.. He did So; and I remained at the. door,, where I heard him address himself to her
ft
as one of my friends who was come to. bring her news of me. At my name she arose and inquired eagerly where I was,, and how I did? He assured her that if. she desired it he would bring me to her. feet, as saithsul, and as much in love as ever. Ah! when? cried she. today! this moment! replied my fiend:, this happy instant need not be delayed. — Speak and hetiall appear. She now compre

The rest of our conversation was in the i Same style. My poor Manon told me her j melancholy tale, and I related mine to her;
while

while our pall misfortunes, and those with which we were still Surrounded, drew from us the bitterest tears:,
The good De Tiroux employed himself in consoling ns; and nothing did itsoeffec tually as the promise he made us of exr erting his utmost efforts to put an end to our Sufferings.. He advised us not to continue together too long, that no suspicion might arise to prevent our meeting again. But he found it difficult to make us relish > this prudent advice: Manon could not determine to let me depart, but continued holding my hand and my coat. Ah! why do you leave me? Said she : alas! who shall affure me I shall See you again? I do, answered de Tiroux; I promise to bring him again: and as to the place, it is no longer the hospital, an house of punishment and mortification; it is the court of yersailles; the abode of beauty and ele

V
I thought it would be proper to give Something to the Servant who waited upon her, to engage him to Serve her more attentively. It happened that this young man had a good heart, and more senti* fnent than usually belongs to his station. The affecting interview he had been wit jiess to, as well perhaps as the beauty and gentleness of Manon, interested him for her; and a Louis d’or which I gave Iiirrij' completed the prepossession he hadt conceived in ray Savour..
Sir, Said he, taking me on one Side, if you will promise to take me into your Service, or otherwise recompense me for the loss of my place here, I believe I could find a way to put Mademoiselle Manon into your hands. It may easily be supposed

posed. that I listened eagerly to this diff gourse; and tho’ I had nothing in fast that I could command, I promised him. more than he ashed for: indeed 1 knew I could at any time Sufficiently repay Such a person for his Services, and theresore gave him without hesitation the most lavisli asturances of reward. I ashed him by what means he thought he could Set mademoiselle Manon at liberty? By the most Simple in the world, answered he : I Shall let.her out of her chamber, and condust her to the street door, where you must be readystn a coach to receive her.. I objested to this the hazard there would be in her crossing the courts and galleries: he owned there would be Some; but in these cases, Said he, one must hazard Something, and I think in this the rish isless than you Seem to apprehend.

[' 2o6 ]
Gstarmed with an hope So flattering, I' communicated what, the man had Said, to > de Trioux, who had absented himself a moment to Speak to a person in another part of the house : But he was not So Sanguine as I was: he allowed that there.
f
might be a bare possibility of her escaping by this means; but that on the other hand, the probabilities of sailing were numerous; and if she was detested in the attempt, she mull be lost for ever. Besides, continued he, if you should Succeed in getting her. away, you must instantly quit Paris; to conceal yourselves will be impossible. A' man alone may easily evade all Search, but with a woman So remarkably beautiful as Manon, it will be impossible toi. elude the strist search that will be made for you both.
However just this reasoning was, the hope of recovering Manon was Superior to

Said I to my friend, i my love r now makes me rash.. must attempt it, -, be the consequence what it will; and as? to leaving Paris, it is what I propose do • We then agreed with the Servant that we would defer our. enterprise onlyc until the next day : and to Secure the suc cess of it as much as possible, he desired us to carry a Suit of men’s clothes for Manon to put on, which he thought would. very much facilitate his plan. It was difficult to get them into the house; but my, invention supplied me with the means. I desired De tiroux.to put a thin waistcoat under his own; the care of providing every thing'elfe I took upon myself: and the next morning when we returned to the hospital, T carried, concealed in my clothes, linen and stockings, and put over my usual coat a very long • Surtout, which
prevented
k
t
[ 2o8 j
prevented any observation on the fulness' ■qs the rest of my dress,
As Soon as we got into her room, De Tiroux gave her his waistcoat, and I my. coat,, as the Surtout was enough to go oul with; and nothing was now wanting ta complete her dress, but breeches,, which by a strange oversight. I had forgotten. The distress this omission threw us into was ridiculous enough, and in any other situation would have been laughable; but in the hazardous state of our enter -- prize, it was too Serious an'embarraffment, I Vv'as half distrasted that So trifling a. cirr cumstance Should threaten to overturn our whole Scheme; however I had no means of remedying the evil, but by giving her my own, which I did without farther hesitation; and in my long Surtout, and
9
with Some contrivance, I got out myself without any remark being made on this
deficiency
[ 209 ]
deficiency of my apparel, and returned to De tiroux’s house, where the day appeared the longest I had ever pasted.
Night at length came: we got into a
O O Of
fiacre, and went at the appointed time to the street into which the great door of the hospital opens, and waited a few yards below it; where we had not been many minutes, before Manon and her condustor appeared. They both got in: I received Manon in my arms, who trem. bled like a leaf. The coachman ashed where he was to go? Drive me. Said I, to the end of the world — carry me where I shall never more be Separated from Manon!
ft
This unguarded Sally, which I know not what postested me to make, nearly occasioned the most fatal consequence, The coachman remarked So extraordinary
an.
[ 210 ]
t
an exprejssion; and when De Tiroux told him whither he should drive us, he Said he was afraid we were engaged in a bad' affair, and perhaps he should be involved in its consequences j. for he Saw plainly that the handsome youth was a woman whom we had rescued from the hospital,, and he was not all disposed to ruin him r Self to oblige us. This Scrupulous nicety meant only that we were to pay an extraordinary price for the coach; but we were in too much danger for expoftulast tion. Hush! hush! friend, cried I, it: will be a Louis dshr in your way : after, which, is I had proposed to him to burn ^
the hospital he would have assisted mo witfigiit Scruple.
r
We were now taken to l’escaut’s lodg«. ings. It was late, and, De Tiroux desired to. be put down near his own house, which was in oijr way, promising to call upon
115:,;
[ 211 ]
US the next day. Manon wept with joy at Seeing herself as we hoped in Security:
\
but we had dreadsul alarms yet to encounter. When we Hopped at the door of the house where l’escaut lodged, a dispute commenced with the coachman that threatened the most fatal catastrophe : I repented of having promised him a Louis; not only because the Sum was So unreasonable, but because I really had not a Louis in the world: a Louis however I should have given him if I could have obtained it from l/escaut, whom I sent for to the door, and told him in a whisper my situation.
He, who was of a fierce and violent dispofition, and but little accustomed to moderate his ill humour towards the driver of a ■ fiacre, answered aloud — a Louis fpr the
w
rascal! give him rather twenty good blows with your cane! So Saying, he Snatched my cane out of my hand, meaning to execute his threat; but the coachman, who

had.

had perhaps before felt, that the wrath of a life guard, or mousqueteer, was not to be encountered with impunity, drove off as faff as he could, loudly complaining that I had deceived him, but that he knew how to make me repent it, and that I should certainly hear from him. This gave me the Severest inquietude; for I doubted not but that he would apply to the nextcommiffary, and tell all he knew of us..
You undo us, l.dscaut, Said I; there is now no sasety Sorus here; we rriust instantly depart, or the Commissary willshe upon us.
So Saying, I gave Manon my arm, and hastened away from a place where we were, in Such instant danger, accompanied by. l.dscaut, and followed by the I'ervant.
It is astonishing by what a strange course Providence Sometimes brings about ks ordinations. Scarce had we advanced an hundred paces on our way, when a man of military, appearance, but whose face I
did,
ft.
[ 213 ]
did not distinstly See, approached us, and •going close to L.dfcaut, cried out “It is, l’escaut; he Sups tonight in the other world, ” and instantly fired a pistol, the ball of which entered his temple, and he tell dead at our feet, while the astastin escaped immediately.
I now preflfed Manon more eagerly to hasten away. To the corps before us^’ our presence was useless, and our assistance impossible; and I dreaded that the watch, who I knew would instantly appear, would stop us. We hastened then, Manon, the Servant and I, down the first cross street that we came to; but She was So terrified that it Was with great difficulty I Supported her trembling steps still we reached the end of the street, where wc Saw a fiacre
stand, into which we got; but when the

coachman asked us where he should take us to, I knew not what to reply.

1 had no certain asylum, no friend to whom I dared have recourse in this exh gency; and what was yet worse, I was without money, having not more than half a Louis in my pocket. Fright and fatigue had So overwhelmed Manon, that she was Sainting in my arms, while my own imagination was filled with horror and amazement at the recent ‘murder of l’escaut, and dread of being stopped by the watch; What could I do? whither go Happily, after a moment’s pause, I Tccollested the inn at Chaillot, where I pasted Some days with Manon besore I went to live in the village, I thought 'that there, as I was known, I should obtain credit for Some days, and be in Safety, Carry us to Chaillot, Said I to the coachman: he refused to go thither So late under a pistol, which was another Subjest of embarrassment. At length, however, we agreed for Six livres, which was nearly all the money I had; and we went

Dn, while I endeavoured to console Manon; though in fast despair was in my heart.
I believe I should have been tempted to put an end to my existence, had I not held in my arms her who alone made lise desirable. That consoling reflestion gave me courage to meet the distrestes besore me. I have her. Said I, once more! she is mine! she loves me! what is the world to me, what calamity can I not encounter with indifference, while sure of that affestion which is more to me than the universe! I felt however, that while the world was thus (lightly regarded, 1 wanted some of its comforts to Save me from the deplorable indigence which threatened me.
It was near midnight when we arrived at Chaillot: but the people of the inn received us like their old customers; nor

I dirested as elegant a Supper to be immediately prepared for her, as if we had been in the highest affiuence : she did not know that I was without money, and I determined to conceal it from her, and return in the morning to Paris, where I hoped to find a remedy for that worst of

While we Supped, my eyes wandered over her person, which the darkness of the room in which she was at the hospital, and the confusion we had been in since she left it, had prevented my observing be ^ I thought her thin, and her countenance was pale and languid : I asked her if her paleness arose from the terror she had : undergone in Seeing her brother asfash

and the avidity with which she pursued pleasure and dissipation, overcame the
better qualities of her charasten ^ — Or
$
rather her charaster itself was no longer anything. For when she Saw other women in Splendour and affluence, and

I hastened the next morning to Paris. I
O j
The death of L.dfcaut, and oqr want of ^ linen and necessaries, gave me pretence enough with Manon, and 1 told her, as
DWELL
as my host, that I should take a coach; but it was a mere gasconade — necessity obliged me to walk; which I i did as fast as o .ffible stili I came to the I

\
sat down upon the grass, that 1 might ressest for a moment on what I had to do at Paris.
I had three points to confider, which required all my attention. I wanted everything requisite fur our present Support, and Some means of procuring Subsistence hereafter; and what was not of Ids im portance, I had measures to take to Secure the sasety of Manon and myself.
After having exhausted every idea on the two last Subjests, I could conclude on nothing; but was obliged to confine myself to the most prelfing circumstance, which was that of getting a Supply of money. I thought, as to the rest, that for Some days we might remain at Chaillot without any hazard; and that it would be time enough to provide for
L 2 our
'S 2 20 d
*
our future expenses when we had pro 'cured wherewithal to pay stir onr immediate Support,
The question then was reduced to this; how to procure a Sum for my •present life? De Tiroux had repeatedly
4
offered me his assistance; shut how could I determine to accept it; how Submit to lay open to a man who was almost a Slranger to she, my misery and my poverty, ..and ask him for money. I could not think of it without the utmost pash and consusion.
I then turned my thoughts towards my friend Tiberge. My first friend! my good Tiberge! cried I; be will not Surely resuse me? I know the goodness of his nature; he will be touched with my Sorrows, and will relieve them. But .^alasl he will harrass me with precepts to
which
LI c7r T
which I cannot listen, and I Shall she' forced to hear exhortations and reproaches which will embitter ail bis kindness : and there is hardly anything I would not' rather endure than go thio’ the irksome scene to which my application to him will sxpose me, and the trouble and remorse it will make me Suffer. But is it of my fels I am to think? No! it is the Support Manon! her very existence, that is now in question. Her love and fidelity depend on my finding means to supply her with conveniences; - and com ’ pared to the fear of loling her every, □ther consideration is as nothing; for she is to me in place of glory, happiness?? fortune! After this argument myv Soliloquy was Soon at an end: I arose, and continued my way towards the, residence of Tiberge.

On entering Paris I took a hackney, coach, though I had not enough to pay
I
for the hire of it; yet I thought myself So sure of procuring money from Tiberge, that I Selt no uneafiness about that. I i
I
I
ordered the man to drive to the Luxem
(
bourgh, and Sent to tell Monsieur Tiberge that I waited for him. He came in: :

stantly, and I told him without any apology the nature and extremity of my wants. He asked me if the sum of an hundred pistoles (which I had formerly borrowed of him, and punstually repaid) would now Suffice? and on my answering it would, he went immediately to Setch it, with that air of Satisfastion that only true friendffiip can give.
Though I never entertained any doubts of his obliging me, I was Surprised that I heard no murmurs or reproaches.' But I was deceived in thinking

[ 223 I
ng I should get off So easily; for where
le returned, and had counted out the noney, he dcsired me besore 1 let hinre o take a turn with him in the garden ind 1 discharged the coach and followed lim.

I had not mentioned Manon'; and he

vas ignorant of her having recovered her iberty: his Sermon therefore turned }nly on my rash flight from St. Lazare,. m.d. the Sear he conceived of my plunging; into libertinism. He told me that he iappened to go to St. Lazare the day after my escape, where he was shocked and Surprised at hearing the manner of it' from the good Superior,, who had not recovered from his fear and agitation,.

however had the generosity to conceal what had happened from the Lieu

I had theresore, Said he,, nothing to fear from that quarter; but he belought me to make use of this favourable turn in my affairs, to recover my reason; and immediately write to my., father to Solicit a reconciliation, and leave to return to rny family.
4
I heard him to the end; and in much of his discourse I found Subjest of satis fastion. 1 had nothing now to dread from the affair of St. Lazare, and rnight walk fearlessly in the streets of Paris. I was also glad to find that Tiberge had not the Smalleft idea that Manon was out of the hospital, and again with me; and \ remarked that he avoided naming her, in the pcrsuasion perhaps that my attach

I would on that condition return to my duty.
\
My hope was, that Such an .application
would induce him to Send me a. Sum of money under pretence of having occasion for it to defray the expenses of a. course of exercises in the academy; (Sori did not believe he would again listen to my pretensions of entering into orders) nor,, in prosefling a desire to begin a course of academical exercise was I entirely insmcere.
I. willed to be occupied by Such improvements as became my age, and the station to which I was born, when these pursuits could be conciliated with my love;.

and I Saw nothing improper or impossible in pursuing these studies, and living with Manon.

I promised Tiberge to write that very day to my father; and as Soon as I left him went into a coffeehouse for that purpose. I wrote in a style So moving and Submiffive, that in reading over my letter I persuaded myself it would have the effest I intended, on the tender and paternal heart of my father.,
Tho’ I was now in a Situation to pay a
ft
coach, I felt myself So proud of my liberty, that I resolved to go on foot to De Tironxst; but as 1 walked along, it struck me that though I had nothing toed
O
apprehend from what had happened at St. Lazare,.! was still in danger from the affair of the hospital, and was not free from hazard in regard to the murder of l’escaut: for as I was last with him, I. might be called upon as a witness of his death.

much, that going into an obscure corner I called from thence to the first, hackney coach I Saw pasting, which carried me dircstly to De Tiroux, who laughed heartily at my fright when I described it to him. It appeared indeed laughable to myself, when he informed me I had nothing to apprehend either from assisting in the flight of Manon or from having been present at the death of her brother. He Said, that fearing he might himself have been suspested of carrying off Manon from the hospital, he had gone thither the next day, and pretending entire ignorance of what had happened, asked to See her; and that the people of the house were So Sar from snpposing that either himself or me had had any share in her elopement, that they eagerly related her flight to him, and expressed their astoniflirnent that So beautisul a girl as Manon should go off with a servant. To which De

Tiroux answered coldly, that he Saw, nothing Surprising in it; for liberty was so desirable, that it was,., natural to lose; sight of all other considerations in our endeavours to obtain it.

De Tiroux, from the hospital went ta. l.dscautst lodgings, not doubting but that Manon and I were there; but the. man of the house,, he had not. Seen us, and told him it was not at ail Surprising that we had not been there,. for that we undoubtedly had heard l.dscant was astaffinated. On inquiring of this man into the circumstances osthis extraordinary affair,, heshad learned, that about two hours before it happened, one. of l.dfcaut’s comrades in the guards > came to his room, and they Sat down to play; when L.dfcaut won So rapidly, that the other, who in less than an hour had lost all his money, (conlisting of,,
about
Vf; '22q ‘].
shbout an hundred crowns,) from impatience became outrageous; and when they left play finding himself without a livre, had desired l.dscaut to lend him Some of the money he had won of him; which not being readily complied with, ■a quarrel began, which arose to the highest pitch of animosity on both Sides, and a challenge was given which l’escaut refused to accept; whereupon the other left shim. Swearing he would take the first opportunity of being revenged, which threat he executed the Same night.
monsieur .De Tiroux added that he

liad been extremely uneasy about Manon and me, and anxious to know where we were. I insormed him of the place of our retreat; and he begged I would give him leave to Sup with us that evening, which request I answered as hrs 'friendly politeness deserved.

I know not whether he thought I made this proposal to take advantage, of his generoshy, or whether he asted from the mere impulse of his natural liberality, but he agreed to go with me to the Ihops, and begged he might recommend those that Served his father’s house; where he hirnfels chofc many articles of apparel, much richer and of an higher price than 1 should have thought of purchasing, and forbid the tradesmen to receive any money from me in payment, which he took entirely on himself This he did in a manner so roole and easy, that I did not blush at receiving his generous gifts;

The attention I had given to the Chevalier des Grieux convinced him 1 was much interested in his history; but as he had now Spoken for near two hours, and appeared fatigued, I begged he would take a short respite, and favour us with his company at Supper. He did So; and as Soon as the table was removed, he re asslimed his narrative as follows; and the conclusion aoleared tome more extraordi

My return with an air of perfect
content, and the polite attentions of my friend de Tiroux, dissipated all remaining anxiety frohi the bosom of Manon. Her countenance was again lightened up with Smiles, and her eyes
feafllimed their lustre. Let us Sorget,

\
More happy with Manon and my 'hundred pistoles, than the richest citizen of Paris with his accumulated treasares,
I gave way to the gaiety of my present dispofition; nor did any fears for the future, embitter these agreeable moments,
I was almost Sure that my father would allow me wherewithal to live handsomely at Paris, because as I was now in my twentieth year I stiould Soon have a right to demand a share of my mother’s fortune.
I did not conceal from Manon that my present stock of money consisted only of an hundred pistoles; but it was enough to keep tis from inconvenience till Something better occurred; which me thought must Soon happen, either
from
[ 3 J
from the claims I had on my motherv property, or from the resources of play. The first fortnight or three weeks pasted without my thinking of anything but the happiness I was again postested of. Some remains of sentiment, as well as some fear of the Police, made me delay from day today returning to the Association at the Hotel de transyivanie. I contented myself with frequenting less remarkable parties; ant the favour of fortune for this time prevented the necessity of my having recourse to any dishonourable means to Secure her on my Side. I usually pasted a part of my afternoon at Paris, and returned to Supper at Chaillot frequently accompanied by monsieur de Tiroux, whose friendship for us seemed hourly to augment.

‘ment in the company of some young Momen in the neighbourhood, whom the return of Spring had brought to Chaillot. Walking, and little parties at each other’s house, alternately employed them; and the trifling winnings they made at their card tables were allotted by the winner to pay for their coach. They frequently went to walk in the Bois de Boulogne; and when I returned of an evening I found Manon more gay, more tender, and more lovely than ever,
*
Some pasting clouds however a little obscured the sunshine of my happiness. But they were Sooii dishpated; and the gay and entertaining humour of Manon even turned them to our amusement, which I still remember with a melancholy pleasure, and my lovely unfortunate

the charms I then Saw her adorned witstr when youth, beauty, and vivacity even to extravagance, (and which would have become nobody else) made her the most dangerous and most enchanting objest in the creation.
One evening, on my return from Paris, the only valet wg kept (and who
was the same as had delivered Manon from the hospital) took me on one fide, and told me, in an embarraoed manner, that he had a Secret of importance to communicate to me. I encouraged him to Speak; and he Said, aster Some hesitation, that a foreign nobleman Seemed to have conceived a pastion for Manon, * The agitation of Spirits into which this intelligence threw me, occasioned an immediate change in my countenance. Has she shown any inclination for him? Said I,, in. a voice Sufficiently expressive

of what I felt. Not that I know of. Sir, answered my Servant, who was frightened at the vehemence of my manner, but having seen this foreigner constantly frequent the Bois de Boulogne at those hours when he was sure of meet
ta
ing mademoiselle Manon, and, often endeavour to engage her in conversation,
I thought it would be right to find out who he was, and therefore made acquaintance with his Servants; from whom J have learned that he is an Italian Prince, and that he frequents these walks with a view to some adventure of gallantry; but I could gain no farther intelligence. This nobleman having discovered that I belonged to mademoiselle, told me, as he passfed by me to go to his coach, that J was happy to be in the Service of
I
the most charming person in the world. My Servant trembled while he made this recital, the end of which I attended to

I assured him I was pleased with his fidelity, and even promised him an handsome reward; and without expressing any mistrust of Manon, ordered him to watch the foreigner, and to; relate to me all he observed,
The manner in which the man re -- counted this to me, threw me into the cruellest alarm and I doubted whether he had not supprelted part of what he: knew; but on conssderation I regretted that I had Shown So much emotion, for * aster all it was possible that Manon might be ignorant of her conquest; nor could I justly impute it to her as a crime, that she was beloved.

fiipportable; and yet, from what already happened, I felt that all my suspicions returned on the stightess: idea of a rival,
I went the next day to Paris as usual, without having formed any other resolution than that of playing as deep and desperately as I could, in hopes that if fortune favoured me I might be in a fitii ation to quit Chaillot the moment I found any Sarther Subjest of inquietude. On my return, my man informed me that the foreign, nobleman had appeared as usual in the walks, and had Spoken again to him, (the valet) and entered into a warm detail of his love for made. moiselle Manon; relative to whom he ashed a multitude of questions, and endeavoured to win him by a considerable bribe to deliver a letter (which he produced) to his mistress.

During the rest of her walk, as well as since she came home, the vivacity of her humour had exceeded its usual bounds; and she had incessantly worn the appearance of the most thoughtless gaiety.

This determination, without putting me em tirely at.easc, made me rather more tranquil the rest of the evening.,

When we arpse in the morning, Manon, told me that tho’she desired to pass the whole day alone in our apartment, sho would notwithstanding have me dress, and that she herself would stress.my hair.. My hair, was then remarkably fine, and she had Srequently amused hersels. in disposing it in different fashions: I now

In this trifling way we had pas sed part of the morning and after dinner she continued in the Same playful mood, while her innocent chearfulness seemed So natural, and So unlike artifice, that I could not believe it a prelude to a new instance of treason: and I was once or twice on the point of opening my suspicions to her, but delayed it only in hopes of her confeshng to me. what had pasted.
While she was still trifling thus agreeably, and had inststed again on re adjusting my head, the Servant came in to Say that the Prince of Villabianca was below, and desired to See mademoiselle. This

the meaning. Notwithstanding his embarrassment, he failed not to make a most profound bow..

During this ridiculous harangue, % which she had undoubtedly meditated,
I made fruitless efforts to disengage

myself; and feeling some compafiion for a man of rank treated with So little

ceremony, I was even disposed to apo^ logize for this insult. But he presently recovered his Surprise; and his answer, which I thought gross, took from me all my, intentions, of consoling. shim mademoiselle, Said he, with a Sorced Smile, .^ my eyes are. indeed opened; and Ishee you are not the novice I took you for. He went downstairs without looking behind him,., and .muttering that the women of France, were, no better than, those of Italy; and I was not tempted to give him better opinion of the fair Sex,,

Manon^, as Spori as he was gone, threw herself into a chair, and made the room echo with bursts of laughter, in. which I could not Sorbear accompanying her, though I own I thought she had carried the pleasantry too far. Touched a

She recounted to me the progress of the amour; and told me that aster having continually tormented her in the Bois de Boulogne, where he expressed his love shy the most ridiculous grimaces, he had written her a letter by the coachman, wherein he made her a formal declaration of love, and gave her his name and all his titles, and promised her, on the other fide the Alps, a brilliant Sortune and eternal adoration. That llie had at first determined to communicate this adventure to me; but that Sancying she could produce Some amusement from it, she could not resist making the experiment, and had Sent the Italian a flattering answer, with liberty to See her at her house; and that she enjoyed the Surprise

approve of all she had done..
i have remarked throughout, that when I thought myself the happiest. Heaven has chosen that hour for my ghastisement. Thus it was at this period, when I felt mysels So well as siired of Manonst tenderness, and the friendship of De Tiroux, that I appre -- hended nothing from the malignity of my destiny. That destiny however still pursued me, and. now prepared for me Such a Satal catastrophe, as reduced me to the deplorable extremity in which you Saw, me at Prsty, and, afterwards into Such calamities a? can hardly be believed.
t 19 ]
One evening, a few days after Manon had dismilsed her Italian admirer, we were at supper at our hotel with De Tiroux, when we heard a coach stop at the door, a circumstance which at that unusual hour excited our curiosity. We inquired who it was, and heard that it was young Gevres de Malleville, the Son of our most cruel enemy; at whose name name the blood rushed into my face. He comes, cried I impetuouqy, that I may punish him for the infamous nsage I have received from his father: he shall not leave the place till we have measured our swords. Monsieur de Tiroux, ■whose intimate friend he was, entreated me to be cool, and assured me he was
0
a most amiable young man, whose Sentiments were So different from those of his father, that nothing had ever given him So much concern as the injuries we had Suffered; and that I should no Sooner be

He entreated me to give hi in leave' to bring him up, and‘ invite him to partake of our Supper; ^ and protested that Manon was in no danger from this interview, as he could answer for De Malleville as for himself; and was Sure that as Soon as he knew us he would become our most zealous advocate. After
V
Such assurances I no longer hesitated,, and De Tiroux went down to his friend.
Before they joined us, he told him to whom he was going to be introduced, and we beheld a young man whose perfea, and. address were very plealing.and^agree. able. He expressed in polite terms bis Satisfastion at the favour Tiroux had done him jn procuring him our acquaint- --

ance, and eat of our repast: with an appetite
that did it honour. When the Ser
%

vants had removed the table, our conversation became more Serious: he astumed an air of contrition and Sorrow, in Speaking of the outrage his father had committed, and made us many apolo ^,. gies. 1 will shorten my excuses, Said he, to leave as Soon as possible a Subjest which I cannot recollest without shame. Warm as these Sentiments' were in the beginning of our conversation, they Soon became much more So.; for he had not been half an hour with us, before I discovered that the charms of Manon had their usual effest; his eyes and manner sensibly betrayed him; and tho’ he carefully avoided every word that tended that way, I had too much experience in love not to know the Source of his looks and attentions. He staid with us till a very late hour, and it was day

break before he could determine to quit us, which at length he did with a thousand protestations of unalterable friendship, and with a request that we would give him leave sometimes to renew
a visit which had given him so much pleasure.
A t
He took De Tiroux with him in his coach. I had at this time the most tranquil reliance on the constancy of
Manon, and the observations I made
/
gave me no manner of uneafiness. That lovely creature was so entirely mistress of my heart, that I had no other Sentiments than those of adoration joined to esteem; and far from imputing to her as a crime that she had charmed De Malleville, I felt my self-love Battered in finding myself the foie pofiefibr of the heart and person of a woman whom all the world Seemed to allow the most enchanting

As we were now provided with clothes fit to appear in public, and thought
there was not any hazard in it, Manon
*
was desirous of going to the play : De Tiroux, however, who came early the next day, was to be consulted upon this;
I
and he Soon found that to gratify Manon he muss: Say yes. But this resolution was not executed : for having taken me apart, he told me he was extremely un casy at Something that had happened: I came hither to tell yon. Said he, the consequence of our party last night; Gevres de Malleville is madly in love with Manon, and has told me So : however I am attached to him, I am equally So to you. His intentions in regard to her are extremely blameable and unjust,
and

nd I do not confider myself obliged to keep his Secret, which perhaps I might have done had he meant only to have tried his fortune fairly with your mistress. But I find that he is well informed of the dispofition of mademoiselle Manon. He knows she loves pleasure and affluence, and as he is already polsefled of a considerable fortune, he means to tempt her at once by a magnificent present, and the offer of a settlement of ten thousand
livres a year. Had you been upon an
>
, equal footing, I should perhaps have made a point of not betraying him; but jtiftice, as well as friendship, obliges me to put you on your guard, and the more fb as I have been the unlucky cause of his passion, by imprudently introducing him to your acquaintance,
I thanked De Tiroux for this important communication; and with an ingenuousness

/
i 25 ]
nqpiifness equal to his own, I acknowledged that De Malleville had been rightly informed as to the dispofition of Marion : that poverty was an evil she could not Support; but that however while there was only a difference of more or iess I believed her quite incapable of quitting me for another. That now I had little therefore to fear on that Score. I was in a Situation to let her feel no diff tress; and as my mother’s fortune must Soon be in my poffefiion, I should everyday be better able to Support her in the abundance she could not dilpenle with. However, added I, it is greatly to be feared, that when De Malleville finds he cannot fncceed, he may discover our retreat, and do us Some very ill offices. Apprehend nothing from thence. Said De Tiroux; Gevres de Malleville is capable of an amorous indiscretion, but not of an astion of cruelty and cow

ardice. If he should, however, be assured I would be the first: to punish him, and to repair, the missortune I should So unhappily have brought upon you. 1 thank you for this Sentiment, my dear friend, Said I, but the mischies

would be done, and the remedy uncertain : it is easier to prevent evils than to cure them; therefore the v/isest way will be to withdraw from the danger, by quitting Chaillot, and Settling ourselves elsewhere. It might So, answered he, were there time for the arrangernent; but it will be difficult, if not impossible, for you to do so before De Malleville will be herci As we went home last iiightj or rather this morning, he told me he should be here by noon, which made me come as Soon as I could, to give you notice of his views: you may expest him immediately.

This uncxpested and nnwissied fbf event brought the danger So near that I could no longer look on it with indifference; and as 1 Saw that De Malleville was determined to open himself to Manon; I thought it better to tell her what I had heard of the intentions of this. new rival; believing that when She found I knew of his addresses. She would have strength enough to refuse his offers. I told De Tiroux my thoughts, who
«
answered that it was a delicate measure to hazard. I owned it was, but that every right a man could have to depend upon the fidelity of a woman, I had to rely on that of Manon, She loves ease
and luxury, but Ibe loves me I trust
\
still more: the greatness of his offers will not dazzle her while I have abundance to give her; for Ihe is delicate, but not avaricious; and will Surely prefer me to

She thanked me for the good opinion I had of her, and protested she ■would receive the offers of Gevres de Malleville in such a manner as should give him no inclination to renew them. No, Said I, you must not venture offending him by any rudeness; he may be very hurtful to ns; but you know ways enough, you little rogue you, to
get rid of troublesome lovers. Stay, Said she, an excellent notion strikes me; and I pique myself upon my invention: Gevres de Malleville is the Son of our most cruel enemy; we will revenge the injuries the father has done us, not on

argued: her resolution was taken, Ihe
%
told me it was only necessary to take our measures well, and that there was nothing to fear. I Suffered myself again to be drawn into this irreparable ruim, by the caprice of an adored mistress;.. and while I agreed to make a dupe of De Malleville, by the, usual fatality that attended me, I became his.
About eleven o’clock his coach stopped. He made us the most studied compliments on. the liberty he took ia coming to dine with us — De Tiroux

I
and took De Tiroux with me on pretence of having Something to Say to him; ' De Malleville therefore had an opportunity of Speaking to Manon, of which he failed not to take advantage. I found on my return that Ihe had not given him reason to despair, for he was > ' in the gayest humour in the world. I affested the Same vivacity; and he laughed inwardly at my Simplicity; while the whole afternoon pasted away in lively discourse or proseffions of regard; and he went away as much pleased with my apparent ealiness, as with the elegance of our entertainment,.

No sooner was he departed in his coach with De Tiroux, than Manon ran to me with open arms, and embraced, me, laughing excessively.. She then repeated to me his proposals, without forgetting a word, which, amounted to this; that if Ihe would quit me, he would Share with her forty thousand livres a year, of which he was already, in possession.. reckoning the very large fortune he must inherit front his Sather;) ihe should be mistress of his heart and' fortune, and he would immediately esta blifhsher. in an elegant Surnilhed house,, with a coach, a femme de chamber, three footmen, and other Servants in proportion. Truly, cried I, when She had done, the Son is a better Subjest than the father. Speak truly, Manon, does not Such a Splendid offer tempt you? Ah! can you believe it does? Said Ihe 5

fents her lover had promised her, she should desire him to take her to the play, whither she should contrive to carry what money and jewels she could dispose about her, and give the rest to my valet, Marcel, whom she determined to take with her: (he was the young man, through whose aftiftance she was delivered from the hospital, and who appeared to be extremely attached to us.) I was to go in a fiacre to the street called St. Andre des Arc, and towards Seven o’dock was to conceal mysels at the door of the theatre, among the crowd. Her purpose was to " invent an excuse for quitting her box a moment, which she would employ in escaping to me; after which we were to regain our coach, and drive out of Paris by the Fauxbourg de St. Antoine, which was the way to our new lodgings.
This design, extravagant as it was send almost: impossible to be executed;
[ 37 1

and though it too much resembledi what had before been so fatal to us,, yet appeared to her to be mighty well planned.

plaisance with which I agreed to whatever Ihe desired, that I exposed myself to this hazard with the ralheft con fidence.
The hour arrived when Manon was to go. With an aching and foreboding heart I Saw her get into a coach, attended by Marcel, our footman. Before Ihe went, I embraced her, and Said in a
4
melancholy tone, Manon! are you not going to betray me? Ah! will you not deceive me? She complained tenderly of my mistrust:, and renewed in the

I' went Soon after her,. and, hid myself the rest of the afternoon, in,, the costee. house De Fere, au Pont St. Michal. There I staid till .the hour of our appointment, when, getting into an hackney.
■ coach, I drove to the end; of the street St. Andre des Arc, and then walked to;
^ ta. n
the. door of.the play house..
f
I was - Surprised not to find Marcel' among the .Servants that waited there, cs, he had orders to remain there till he. Saw me; however I continued in impatient expestation near an hour, con c sounded amid the crowd of people at the door, anxioufiy watching every person that pasted. At length the time being elapsed when I expested Manon
to

In vain I Searched the whole house: neither the one or the other were there, I quitted the pit,, and again mingled with, the crowd at the door,. burning
with impatience knd anxiety; but Seeing
/
nothing of those I expested, I went back to my coach without knowing what to do next. The coachman perceiving me Some paces off, met me, and told me, with an air of mystery, that a pretty young lady had waited for me near an hour in the coach; that Ihe had described the gentleman she wanted, which he was very Sure was me, and as he had told her I was coming back, She had got into his coach, where she Said she would attend my return.

I. have a letter for you, monsieur, Said She; which will inform

it me, and to permit me, to read it in. a neighbouring, public-house; whither She would follow, me, and desired: me to alk for a private room. From whom, did you take this letter, Mademoiselle, Said I? She answered by da firing me to read it. As Soon as ] got

to a light, I perceived it to be thf hand of Manon, and these were' its Contents.
She told me that Gevres de Malle * ville had received her with a politenels and niagnificence beyond what Ihe could have formed any idea of; that he had Overwhelmed her with presents, and had promised her a continuation of princely Splendour, Notwithstanding which she assured me, she didshot forget me, but that as Ihe could not prevail on Monsteur de Malleville to take her that evening to the play, she was obliged to postpone to a more favourable opportunity the pleasure of feeing me; but that to console me for the chagrin this failure on her part might possibly occasion me, she had found means to procure, as the bearer of her letter, one of the prettiest

There was Something So cruel and insulting in this letter, that Struck to the heart as I was with it, I felt all that, moment as if by a Sudden effort I could forget and throw off for ever my unworthy passion, and my ungrateful mistress. I turned my eyes on the young woman who stood before me. She was extremely pretty, and I wished s to have found her enough So to have
ft
erased the impression of Manon on my torn heart: but that was impossible! Had she possessed theexpreffiye and be -- witching eyes of manouv her noble air, that complexion which Seemed a mingled, assemblage of the most delightful tints, of nature,, and, in short all, thejnfinity
of

[ 43 ]
of charms which adorned that incomparable creature, still not being Manon, she was to me nothing.
Go back, said I to the poor girl; go back to her that sent you; go tell her to enjoy all the advantages of her ' perfidy, and enjoy them if Ihe can without remorse. I abandon her for ever!
I drive her from my thoughts, and for her Sake all her Sex! none can be So charming as she is! but as worthless! as cruel! as mercenary! I believe thern all to be!
I was going downstairs, without knowing what I did.a The rage and agony of my heart concealed itself under a mournsul and gloomy tranquillity; and I even thought I could bear my missortune with resignation. Since 1 felt none
of
[44 3
of those frantic excelses of passion I haj experienced on the former occasions. Alas! I was again the dupe of my own heart. The unfortunate girl who had brought me the letter. Seeing me go down flairs, stopped me to alk what I would have her Say to monsieur Gevres. de Malleville and the lady who was with him? I stepped back into the room, and felt one of those Sudden, changes from a Seeming tranquillity to rage and madness, which only those who know the wild extravagance of •violent passions. can imagine. The most Ungoverned fury Seemed to have Seized, my senses. Go!’said Ito the affrighted: girl, carry to De Malleville and his infamous mistress, all the despair their cursed letter has given me!

Then having exhausted my breath and my strength, my stupor Seemed to return, I fixed my eyes orj., the first objest besore me, but Saw nothing. A stream of tears ran down my cheeks, which, with the Sighs that Seemed to rend my heart, gave me feme relief.

The poor young creature, who Seemed more modest than those of her unhappy profession generally are, was struck with terror and surprise at this strange Scene: ihe came however fearsully to me; but She had no Sooner done So, than I threw
her from me with abhorrence. What

would you have with me, wretched creature! Said I; are you not a woman? are you not of a Sex I detest? the sost

ness of your countenance hides the heart of an hyena; and treason and death is in your bosom. Go, leave me! leave me! She was not unwilling; I believe, to obey me, but being Sufficiently frightened, was hastening to the door, when 1 called, to her to stop. besore you go, tell me,

csied I, why? how? and with what ac sign you was sent to me? Tell me'how you knew my name, and where to find she. She ansv/ered, that She had long been acquainted' with Monsieur Gevres de Malleville, who that evening, at five o’clock, had Sent to fetch her to a great house in a street where She had never seen him before; that there She found him with a very handsome, young lady, playing at piquet, and that they had to .gether commistioned her to bring me that letter; telling her that stie would 'find me at the end of the street St. ani dre, in a hackney coach. I ashed her if they had Said nothing more. She replied, blushing, that they had given her hopes of being entertained by me as a mistress. They deceived you, exclaimed 1, poor unhappy girl! they deceived you: you want a' lover who is rich and happy, and I am neither. Return rather

there to Monsieur de Malleville, he pos feltes all that is necelsary to secure the hearts and persons of pretty women. He has furnished houses, and carriages, jewels, and clothes to give them : but I! — I who have nothing but love and constancy to offer them, mnft be despised, and my misery and simplicity is a Subject for their ridicule. ^
I ran on thus, as the various emotions arose in my soul, almost: without knowing what I was doing, till the violence of my agitation, which was too great to last, began to subside. The transport of pafiion by degrees gave way to other reflestions. I considered that this calamity was possibly to be repaired; and I ashed myself why I stiould be so extremely afflisted at a circumstance which I might have easily foreseen, and indeed ^■s easily have prevented: and why should

I not rather endeavour to find a remedy for my misfortunes, than perpetuate them by giving myself up to ridiculous and useless despondency. I then began to reflest on every means that were likely to restore my mistress to me. To undertake to tear her by force from De Malleville, would be desperation, and had not the least appearance of success : but I thought if I could See her for a moment, the influence I still hoped I had over her would again throw her into my arms. I thotightt knew her heart
and its feelings So well, that I should at

tack it with advantage. I knew she loved me; and amidst her giddiness, and wanton trifling With my anguish, I thought I had a lasting ascendancy over her. I determined then to employ every art to procure a sight of her; and after

many Schemes,. I fixed on the following one.
De Tiroux had rendered she So many services, that I could not doubt of the Sincerity of his friendihip and affection for me: I proposed then to go to him instantly, and engage him to Send for
Gevres de Malleville, on Some pretence
«
or other, which might give me time to Speak to Manon; whom I meant to Seek even in the house of Gevres de Malleville, during his absence. This idea restored me to Some degree of tranquillity.
I made a liberal present to the young girl who was still with me; and that flic might not return to De Malleville to recount the Scene that had passed, I took from her a direction to her lodgings, and gave her reason to believe I would pass the night with her there.

As Soon as I had dismilsed her, I got into my fiacre, and bid the coachman drive me as fall as possible to St. anne’s street, where De Tiroux dwelled, and I

was lucky enough to find him at home, of which good fortune I doubted, and Seared as I went along. I acquainted him instantly with the Subject of my un eafiness, and the Service I expected from him. He Seemed surprised and shocked to learn that De Malleville had So easily, Seduced Manon from me; and he knew that he was the original occasion of it, by introducing him So inconsiderately to our acquaintance; and I took care not to tell him that I had in a great measure been accestary to my own missortune, by consenting to the plan Manon had formed of possessing herfels of De malleviile’s money and presents, and

De Tiroux, full of indignation against

De Malleville, and of companion for me, offered me his Sword, and that of all his friends if it were necessary to restore me my mistress; but I told him, that by cunning, rather than by force, we must hope to retrieve her; and that any violent proceedings in our Situation might be fatal to us both. Let us keep our Swords, Said I, for the last
extremity only, I think I have found an easier and more certain way.,

He acceded to all I proposed, and

that he would contrive*to detain him

He assured me I Should be Satisfied, and would have departed immediately to execute what I required; but I advised him to Send a note from the house where we were, in which he (De Tiroux) stiould desire De Malleville instantly to come to him. I will watch. Said I, the moment of his coming out, and being known only to Manon and my valet, I Shall easily gain admittance to her. When De Malleville comes, tell him that the pressing affair on which you dessred to
See him, is a loss at play, that you must conceal from your Sather, and that you cannot immediately command the money; and dessre him to lend it to you for a; few days. It must of course take up

As' Soon as they were gone, I rapped gently at the door, which was opened to me by Marcel, to whom I made a sign not to Speak; and ashed him in a low voice if he could not introduce me to manon’s apartment without the knowledge of the other Servants, He said
that

[ 55 ]
that he easily could, and we went together sostly upstairs without meeting any obstacle, and I charged Marcel to Suffer nobody to approach while I was there.
I had now a new occasion to admire the extraordinary character of Manon. Far from testifying any marks of confusion at this unexpected meeting, she Seemed only to be surprised; and rising up with a book she had in her hand, she advanced to embrace me. Saying, ah! my love! is it you? Heavens! how hazardous you are? vvho would have expected you here today?
I disengaged myself from her, and put her angrily away; while stepping back to avoid her advances, which disconcerted her, she remained in evident

pain and confusion. Her eyes, and the change of her complexion, expressed her uneafiness and anxiety,
ft
Tho’ I was So justly irritated against her, Such was the strength of her ascendancy over me, that in Seeing her I almost forgot the justice of my resentment. I was obliged to Set before my eyes the whole Scene that had just past, and to rouse my indignation by resteding on her repeated perfidy and ingratitude,
anel this last instance, So cruel and un
\
pardonable. I remained Silent Sometime. Manon continued standing besore me. Sufficiently alarmed at my agitated and disordered looks: ffie trembled, grew pale, arid Seemed ready to fink at my feet.
This was a Sight that immediately Subdued me,. Ah! Manon! cried I;.

Terrified by the violence of my manner, Ihe had no power to move,;

but' continued on her knees, with her i head on the chair I had left. I advanced hastily to the door, and turning for a last look, I Saw her motionless and hardly breathing;, her eyes drowned in tears the colour fled from her cheeks. Then it was that I found how much She was still mistress of my heart. By one of those changes to which violent palston. Subjests the human mind, I felt myself irresistibly impelled to fly towards her.
I raised her from the ground; and amidst the tenderest caresses, I entreated her to forgive me, as if Ihe had been the injured person. I confelsed that I was unworthy of her; and placing her in a chair, I threw myself in my turn on my knees, and becoming the Suppliant, '

[ 62 ]
woman, made you believe, perhaps, that I quitted you for ever, and that I even sent her to Supply my place; but indeed this was not my intention, whatever appearance it might have. I will tell you what passed. It is true that Gevres de Malleville had prepared for me a reception that exceeded every expestation I had Sormed. The house, the Surniture,
, the equipage that he has presented me with, are in the first style of magnificence. He gave me too a casket con
O
taining ten thousand livres, and a number of jewels, among which are the valuable pearl necklace and bracelets formerly purchased by his father. An elegant collation was ready for me; after which he proposed that we should Sit down to piquet while Supper was |
I
preparing. I will own that all this
. profusion struck me, I considered that
it
[ 63 ]
V
it would be folly to deprive ourselves at once of So many accommodations, and to content ourselves only with the money and the jewels; for that should 1 continue with De Malleville our fortune would evidently be establifhed, and we. might live in ease and affluence at his expense.
I determined therefore to found him in regard to you, that I might See from his manner what probability there was of our being Suffered to See each other, if you could be brought to consent to my plan. On my naming you, he asked me what were my Sentiments of you, and whether I Selt no regret at quitting you? I answered, that you was every way So amiable, and had ever treated me with Such tenderness, that it would be Strange if I
had no attachment to you, He allowed

[ 64 3
S
you merit; and Said that from the first he had conceived a favourable opinion of you: but he wistied to know how. I thought you would bear my departure; when you knew I was with him. I told him that our connexion had now been of so long continuance, that the first ardour of your pastion for me was much abated; besides which, that your circumstances were far from being easy, and that probably you would on that account be. less hurt at an event which relieved you from an expense you was ill able to Support.
«
I added, that I had So little apprehended any opposition, that I had used y no finelse to get away, shut had told you. I wanted to come to town on Some business: : you shaving the same intention, we had Set out together, and that 1 left you without your expressing any
anxiety
%
[ 65 ],
t >
anxiety to know whither I was going. IS
I thought, Said he, that the Chevalier
was disposed to live on terms of amity >
with me, I should eagerly offer him my friendihip and Services, I assured him that from what I knew of your charaster I had no doubt but that you would receive Such advances as you ought; particularly if he could assist you in the management of your pecuniary affairs, which in consequence of a long disagreement between you and your Samily, were in the utmost disorder,
Hejnterrnpted me with protestations of his desire to Serve you to the utmost of his power in every way: then assuming a gayer air, he Said that if a pretty mis tress was your objest, he would even recommend to you one he had quitted to attach himself to me. I approvedof this
idea,

[ 66 ]
idea, continued Manon, more persestly to destroy all suspicion of my stncerity; and finding everything likely to favour my.projest, I anxioufiy wistied for the means of informing you of my change of System, Searing you would be alarmed and irritated at my misting my appointment.
*
To obtain means of writing to yon then, it was that I proposed to him to Send this new mistress to you immediately, I was obliged to have recourse to this expedient, for I found he would not leave me a moment. He Icnghed at my sh easily agreeing to the projest; and calling his valet de chamber, bid him go to the young woman, whose residence he knew, and direst her to go to Chaillot with a mefiage to you, which he was about to deliver, when I stopped him by telling
him

him you was not to be found at Chaillot; for that when I left you 1 had Said I would rejoin you at the play; or if any unforeseen circiimftance prevented my getting thither, that you had agreed to wait ior me in a fiacre at the end of the rue St, Ajidre. theresore it would be Sar better to Send the young woman thither, if it were only to prevent your having the mortification of waiting there fruitlessly great part of the night; and I added that it would not be amiss to write you a line or two desiring you not to expest: me.
To all this he agreed : but I was obliged to write while he looked over me, therefore I dared not explain myself too Sar in the letter, which I now find has given you So much disquietude. I will conceal nothing from you, my Chevalier,

She concluded by naming the erabar' ^ raffment into which the receipt of De tiroux’s letter had thrown De Mallei

i
an hour; for which reason I could not

avoid expressing a degree of affright when,
I first Saw you; nor can I now behold you without terror.

I listened to this discourse with all the temper I could command; though every word was as a dagger to my heart, and
^. '. -. r'
overwhelmed me with mortification. Her intended infidelity was So apparent, that ssie had not even endeavoured to disguise it. It was her design to become confessedly the mistress of Gevres de
ft
Malleville. What a cruel acknowledgment for me! and how Sull of bitterness : yet I ressested that I was in Some degree culpable myself; for it was i who had unguardedly thrown the temptation in her way by telling her of malieville’s passion for her, and by the blind facility with which I had Suffered myself to be drawn into the wild projest: of appropriating
I
C 7° ]
priating his presents without granting him any favour in return.
The ingenuous confeltion Ihe made affested me. The simplicity and open ness with which She acknowledged her errors, and the motives of those errors, had Something in it irresistibly interesting : I Should perhaps rather Say, that my violent and incurable attachment was alone a stronger pleader with me than all these considerations, I felt myself too much elated with the idea of carrying her away from my prolperous rival to rested longer on her intended perfidy: but I could not help Saying, in a melancholy tone of voice. Well, but Manon, with whom did you intend to have pasted this night? This question threw her into an embarrastment that I could not See without pity; changing
theresore
[ n 1
therefore the Subjest: without ihllsting on her answer, 1 told her plainly that I expested Hie would inst'anriy follow me. I will certainly, Chevalier, Said she, if you are absolutely determined against my projest? Your projest, replied I, is infamous! mention it no more. It is enough that I forgive all that has yet pasted. What then shall I go without the ten thousand livres, and the casket of jewels which are mine;
. which he has astually given me? Honour is out of the question. Has De Malleville asted So honourably with you, as to give rise to all these Scruples, exclaimed Manon? This argument, a reflestion on our necestities, and her repeated instances, got the better once more of the little remains of integrity which my miserable infatuation had lest me.
V
While we were preparing to depart, I heard Somebody rap at the street door,

send concluding it to be Gevres de Malleville, I told Manon that if he appeared • to contend with me he was a dead man:
nor could I have commanded myself at
\
the light of him. From this apprehension we were relieved by the entrance of Marcel, who brought me a letter: it was from De Tiroux, to inform me that De Malleville was gone to his own house to fetch the money that he (De Tiroux) had asked of him, and that he had taken advantage of the moment to insorm me. He thought I could not take a more plea sant vengeance on my rival, than by contriving to have him detained for the night, and takingpoiseffion of his house;
9
which appeared to be easy enough, if I could engage two or three steady men, on whom I could depend, to stop him

in the street, and keep him in custody till the morrow. He concluded by promising

1 showed Manon the letter, and told her by what means I had through De tiroux’s aftiftance got De Malleville out of the way. She was charmed with, the idea, and Hill more with what De Tiroux now proposed: this last, how ever, I told her was an adventure I had no inclination to hazard; but she abso lately enlisted. on my undertaking it
It was in vain shat I represented to her ' the improbability of my being able to find people immediately who would undertake to flop De Malleville, and to guard him the whole night: but she protested she should think it want bosh of courage and of love, if I did not at least

make the attempt. Piqued at this insinuation, and overcome by her entreaties, I yielded once more to ast contrary to common-sense, and against the presentiment I test that Some fatal catastrophe would be the consequence of indulging this absurd and fantastic humour. Nothing Seemed So delightful to her as this projest. You shall have his place at Supper, my Chevalier, Said she; you stall Deep in his bed, and early tomorrow you stall carry off his money and his mistress. What a delicious vengeance on both the father and the fon.
Without being tempted with this view of a complete revenge, and wholly because she would have it foi went out in Search of two or three Subalterns of the guards, to whom l.dscaut had formerly introduced me. I found only

house of De Tiroux to that he had hired for Manon. I desired they would use him with civility, but leave no means neglested that might Secure him; which my principal agent protested he would execute faithfully. His intention, he told me, was to take him to his own lodgings, and there to oblige him (De Malleville) to undress, and go into his

This method of Securing oiif prey Seemed well imagined. I retired to an obscure corner of the street, behind my troop; and Soon afterwards I Saw De Malleville appear. On my giving the Signal we had agreed upon, that that was the man, the Subaltern advanced to him with a fierce and resolute air, and Seizing his Sword arm, he put his pistol to his breast, and told him he had no design either on his money or his lise, but that he must Sollow him instantly, V ithout noise or resistance; for is he made the Smallest effort to escape, or raise the notice of the passengers, he would instantly Shoot him. Gevres de Malleville, astonished at this Salutation,
and

and feeing the Soldiers ready to Sustain ■ their officer, made no attempt to disen gauge himself; and I had the Satisfastion

of Seeing him led away as quiet as a lamb. Returning instantly to Manon, I told the Servants, as I went into the house, ■ that I had been with monsieur de Malle ^ who was unexpestedly engaged by an affair that would not permit him to re

' She condusted hersels So as make this Seem natural to the servants who waited on us at table, where we appeared as almost strangers to each other.

• ^
I
That I may explain at once the cause of this terrible effest, I stould remind you, that when De Malleville left the house of Manon, he had ordered one of his Servants to Sollow him. This man was only a few paces behind his master when the Soldiers had Seized him; arid
^ i
terrified

[ 79 1
terrified by So ft range an adventure, herati instantly back to the housc of dedsiroux.
Not however finding him at home, and not knowing any other means of obtaining help, he went from thence to old De Malleville, where, breathless with his fear, he communicated to the father what had befallen his Son, in its most alarming colours. The old man (who had no other child, and who knew that his son’s thoughtless Sollies continually exposed him to danger,) was terrified at this account: he forced, by the Severest threats, the trembling valet to give him an exast account of what his fon had done, and with whom he had pasted that day; that he might know if he had been in Such company as made it probable he might be engaged in a quarrel either at play or of gallantry. ' ' The poor fellow, who believed his maf

This recital made old De Malleville conclude that a love affair was the cause of his son’s alarming adventure; and late as it was he determined to go instantly
to the Lieutenant of the Police: he
/
besought this magistrate to give particular direstions to the patrol of the
night to stop all suspected’persons; and
desiring a serjeant’s guard for himself, which was instantly granted, he went to the street where the valet told him his Son had been Seized; but being
unable

unable to discover any traces of him there, he went on to every place where he thought it at all likely he might hear of him; and being unsuccesssul, came at length to the house of Manon,
D
We had gone into the chamber, the door of which, as well as two others between that and the Hair case, was shut, which prevented our hearing the
t
bustle made at the Street door by the entrance of old De Malleville and his guard, He aseended the ftaircase in silence, and pashng through the other rooms, burst into that where we were on the point of stepping into bed. A countenance So known and So dreaded was like a stroke of thunder to us both. Old Gevres de Malleville! cried I, rush „ing towards my Sword. My attempt was sruitless the guard Seized me

Overwhelmed with • shame. and grief, I answered not; but remained stupid and irresolute, while old De Malleville Seemed to stand meditating how to proceed : then, as if Some particular recollestion had lighted up the fmoshered rage in his bosom, he ad drelted himself to me; Wretch! you have destroyed my Son! I am Sure of it! Piqued at this address, I replied, know, thou old villain! that if I had been disposed to destroy any of thy

Thou, wilt have me hanged, miscreant! answered I; knowest thou not that I boast of blood, in comparison of which thine is mean and inconsiderable? The gibbet is for wretches like thyself! I know what is become of your Son; and if you irritate me farther, how are you sure I shall not put an end to his life before tomorrow, and. afterwards do as much for you?
conseffing that I knew where his Son was, was the most imprudent thing

- and you will destroy him: I believe I shall be able to prevent you this time. Then stepping to the door, he called five or Six of the Soldiers who were waiting below, and ordered them instantly to Secure all the persons in the house, Manon, who Sat all this while weeping on the bed, now attrasted his attention : he approached her, and ironically felicitated her on the power of her charms, which had Such influence over the father and the Son; he would even

Then he obtained from him an account of all the conversation he had heard between me and Manon, (as wc had not Scrupled Speaking while he waited on us, relative to our design), Whatshad happened to young De Malleville he knew not; but he knew ail the former part of our Scheme, and had been inftrusted in the Share he was to have in it; and he told De Malleville that we cither had or meant to cheat his Son, and that mademoiselle. had already received ten thousand livres, which according to our Scheme would never be restored to the heirs of the house of De Malleville.
After having received this account, the old man returned to us, trembling

See here, my pretty dear! do ■you know these again? What, they are to your taste? Oh! I doubt it not! Poor things! continued he, in the most insulting tone, they are really an amiable couple! it is a thousand pities they are not stristly honest!

My heart was now bursting with impotent rage. What would I not have given to have been at liberty one mo r ment. At length I Said, with a moderation which arose from the dark despair ithat Swelled in my Soul, and which I

My worthy Chevalier, answered he, what I mean to do is to Send you both to the Chatelet this night: tomorrow will be a new stay, and we Shall See a little deeper into this affair; and I hope, before I have done with you, you will do me the favour to inform me how you have disposed of my fon,
\
It needed but little reflestion to convince me that to be Sent to the Chatelet would be the most dreadsul thing that could happen to us. Trembling for Manon more than myself, I foresaw all the danger that threatened her: my pride : ahd resentment gave way before the alarming fears that I felt for her, and I resolved, whatever efforts it cost me, to
endeavour
r 90 I
endeavour to soften my enraged persecutor. aituming theresore an air of more civility, I besought him to Savour me with a moment’s attention : I mean not to defend my errors, monsieur, Said I; on the contrary I am ready to confess that youth and an indiscreet passion have occasioned my committing many faults; and that you particularly have great reason to complain of me: but if you have ever felt the force of love; if yoa have ever formed an idea of what the heart of an unhappy young man feels who sees the Sole objest of his affestions torn from him, you may Surely allow Something to the desire of being revenged on a fortunate rival, to whose person however no injury has been committed; and for which I have Surely Suffered enough, already.

of your Son. I had no design either to offend you, or hurt him. He is in sasety : and if you will be So good as to dismist us without farther trouble, I am ready to inform you of the place where I intended he Should have palled the night quietly.
The tiger hearted old man, far from being moved with my penitence and humility, turned his back on me with Scorn: he muttered to himself that he knew well enough what I intended j and then brutally Saying, that for his fon he should find him easily, Since I had not had him affaffmated, he went out, diresting the 1 Sergeant to carry tis instantly to the Petit Chatelet; and as to the Chevalier, cried he, take great care he does not escape; he is a gentleman of contrivance, who has already got out of St. Lazare.

to my Sufferings that drives rne to desperation. The men who were lest in charge of us, now reminded us that they could not wait, and that a coach was at the door to receive us. I gave my hand to the weeping Manon, and led her downstairs. Come, my angel I Said I; come, we must Submit to our melancholy destiny : Heaven perhaps will yet have,

mercy on us, and permit us to See happier days.
They put us into the coach together;
and Manon, who had been unable to.

Deplorable as was this pisture of our past and present condition, what I feared for the future was infinitely worse. The dread I was in on account of Manon was greater than I had yet felt; for I knew that a Second detestion would for her be of the most fatal consequence, and in all probability irretrievable. I would have told her my apprehensions; but as there was no remedy, I knew not how to aggravate the terrors which She already felt: I could only sigh, and embrace her: and of all the emotions with which I was agitated, I dared express only my love. Manon, Said I, tell me truly, will you Swear ever to love me, and me only? She answered, that her
unhappiness

We now arrived at the prison, and were carried into Separate apartments, as indeed I had foreseen. I recommended ] Manon to the keeper; and informed him, that as I was a person of rank, I should recompense him in proportion to his attention. I embraced Manon before we were torn asunder; and having

luckily money enough about me, I gave Manon a part of it, conjured her to keep up her spirits as well as she could, and to fear nothing while I was living to protest and defend her. With the money

Smiling, that he had not yet Seen her, and that she had been represented to him as a dangerous object. At the mention of her a thousand tender recolledions rushed upon me; and while I expressed

what I felt with the most: passionate

All other ills of life are to be born: advershy is not without hope; time accustoms us to support it, and blunts the sting of common misfortune: but an unworthy and vicious child, lost to all sense of honour and redlitude, is an evil which grows every day more insupportable, and can bring only increasing despair to his unfortunate parents 1 Unhappy boy! what have you to say?

Have you not yourself known the force of that fatal passion?? is it possible that I derive my blood from you, and yet that you are of So different a temperament that you have never Selt as I do? Love has made me too complying

to the caprices of an adored mistress: ' that is the extent of my offence; and from thence all the dishonour you complain of. Come, my dear Sir! continued I, you will I know have some consideration for a fon, who, whatever may have been his other faults, has always retained his respect and affestion for you.
A fon who is more an objest of pity than anger. Some tears fell from my eyes — my heart was full — I could say no more. i
The heart of a father; of a worthy, a good father, is an assemblage of all the tenderest sentiments of nature. That of mine, (who besides being the most affectionate of parents, was also a man of fense, and had a cultivated mind) was So affested with the manner of my answer, that he could no longer conceal his emotion. Come, my poor Chevalier! cried
he;

After all,, there was nothing So very' dark in my story that I need Sear, to relate it. Compared with the condust osmany other young, men, mine had not been So atrocious that I should Sear to acknowledge the worst. In the age wherein we live, having been engaged with a mistress I I thought would not be deemed an heinous crime; and a little finesse at play has long been looked upon as a venial. Sm at least.

But I had still honour enough left to disdain Such an apology for astions I could not approve; and theresore withr out attempting to palliate them, I ac

knowledged their disgraceful tendency, and owned I had nothing to offer as an excuse, but the violence of those passions that agitated me : vengeance and love !■ When I had finished what I had to Say, my father asked me again if I could tell him how to Set about procuring my release without noise, which he vas anxious
ft
to avoid. I told him how favourably the Lieutenant of the Police had expressed himself towards me; and that if any difficulty was thrown in the way of my

deliverance, it could come only from the family of De Malleville : but I imaginad that if he would take the trouble to speak to old De Malleville himself, there would be no longer any impediment to my liberation. He promised immediately to Set about it; and I longed, but dared not venture to alk him to Solicit the Same favour for Manon.
Tho’ I had now acquired courage enough to speak plainly to my father, I feared that such a proposal now, might give rise to some resolution fatal to us both,. Perhaps this fear was the cause of the misfortunes that happened afterwards,
i
by preventing my attempting to work.on the tenderness of my father’s nature; and at that time, when he was ■ already Softened,, to have excited his pity towards my unfortunate Manon.. I might then
have
[ 3
have put him on his guard against the' inveterate malignity of Gevres de Malleville : — malignity which made too deep an impression. I do not know, how I ought to have, asted. Let me have done what I would, perhaps my evil destiny would equally have prevailed.
As soon as my shther lest me, he went to the house of Gevres de Malleville, and found him with his fon, to whom the guard who had undertaken to secure
O
him had given his liberty the next morning. What passed between my father and the two De Mallevilles at this conversation I know not; but the event of it was fatal to my happiness..
The two fathers went together to the Lieutenant of the Police, of whom they desired two favours;. first:, that he would
imme
I
[ 1
f
immediately release me from the Chatelet, and the next, that he would either
1
confine Manon for life, or send her to America. It happened that just then a Scheme was executing to transport a number of diftblute and idle people to the Miflifipi; and the Lieutenant of the Police without hesitation gave his word that Manon should be among the first' ' the Police, my father and old Gevres de Malleville
came to the Chatelet, and insormed me
*
I was free; and De Malleville made me a civil fpeecst on what had palsed, and congratulated me on having Such a father, whose worthy example he. hoped I should for the future follow. My father ordered me to apologise to him for the injury which he pretended to have received, and thank him for procuring my release: and we went out all together,
without

without any ones having named Manon i nor did I dare befure them speak to the

keepers as I went out. Alas! my endeavours would have availed nothing: the cruel order came at the Same time as that for my enlargement; and immediately after I left the Chatelet, my poor Manon was carried again to the hos pital, and there confined with several unhappy women who were condemned to partake of the same punishment.
My father having obliged me to fol
/
him to his hotel, and to remain Some time with him, it was near six oshlock in the “evening before I could find an op i portunity of returning to the Chatelet; where, though I knew I Ihoiild not be permitted to see Manon, I thought I might leave a Supply of money and necessaries. for her, and recommend her to the

keeper; for I had not yet had time to refiest on the means of her deliverance.
I ashed to speak to the mailer of the prison; who, satisfied with my former liberality, was well disposed towards me; in consequence of which, he began by lamenting the fate of Manon,. and told me how sorry he was for the afflistiondt would give me. I did not at first: comprehend him; and, he talked for sometime before he saw that I was ignorant of what had happened. He told me, therefore, what I have just repeated, that she was at the hospital, in strist coa linement, and was from thence to be sent to America. Never did the stroke of an apoplexy cause a more Sudden and terrible effest, than this news had on me. The circulation of my blood ceased;

my Senses forsook me; and as I felt them go, I hoped, and believed it was for ever: and even after I began to regain them, something of the same belief remained. 1 looked round the room,
ft
and upon my self, trying to recollest what had happened, and inquiring whether I ' was still unhappy enough to exist: and it is certain that the wilh to be released from insupportable torments, made me at that moment think that nothing was so desirable as death; and that the most horrid pisture that could be drawn of future punishment, was preferable to the state I was now in : but after a moment,
I remembered that though to myself death would be a bleshng, my life was still northeast cefsary to Manon; for that I only could, relieve her, and avenge her; and I swore that my life should from that moment be dedicated to no other purpose.

The jailor gave me every assistance that I could have received from the tenderest friend; and brought me to myself by his attention.

procuring the order,

When I went, out, I found the air gradually diminished the tumult of my boiling blood, and my fury began to subside. I considered that is I could execute all I had threatened, it would be of no use to Manon, and would have deprived me of the power of ashsting her. And should I become an affaffm? for by assfashnation only could I avenge mysels of the De Mallevilles. All I had to do then was to collect my utmost resolution and coolness, to attempt
r ns J
manon’s release, and to think only of that. Money was above all things neces sary, and of that I had very little, and how to obtain it I knew not. I Saw but three per Ions from whom I could, expest it; De Tiroux, my father, and Tiberge; from the two latter I could, expest nothing, if they fufpested for what purpose I wanted it; and the former I was ashamed to importune on such an occasion. However it was no time for Scruples, and despair Suffered me not to hesitate.
s
I went to St. Sulpice, without caring whether I was known there or not, and Sent for Tiberge, by whose discourse I immediately discovered that he knew nothing of my last adventures. This made me change my design of attempting to move his compassion, and I only
Spoke in general of the fatisfastion I
felt

t '>9 ]
Felt in being reconciled to my father i m.d. I desired him to lend me money to, pay a few debts I had contrasted, with shich I did not wish my father Should be acquainted, and which I could not handsomely quit Paris without discharging. He gave me his purse, to. take what I would: I counted out the sum of five hundred livres, for which I offered him my note; but he was too generous to accept it.
V
From thence I went to De Tiroux, with whom I had no reserve, I related to him my misfortune in all its extent; with which indeed he was already acquainted, having never lost sight of me. He heard me however with attention, and expressed his concern; but when I asked him if he could advise me how to procure the release of Manon, he told
me
[ 120 ]
me that he really saw so little probability of succeeding, that without a miracle in our favour it could not be hoped .for: that he had been to the hospital himself to inquire for her, but
•A
was told that the orders given by the Lieutenant of the Police were so stridi

that nobody could be admitted to see her on any pretence whatever; and to complete our despair, the persons with whom She was to go were to be Sent away the following day save one.
1
This discourfe took from me all power of answering; and he went on without interruption to tell me that he had not been to see me at the Chatelet that he might be better able to Serve mc) in not appearing connested with me: and that the few hours since I had left it, he was ignorant where I was; but had

extremely willed to speak to me, to give me the only advice in regard to
Manon that he thought could be of any

service: but this advice was of a nature so dangerous, that he conjured me to conceal carefully that he had given it.
It was to chuse Some desperate fellows, who Should have resolution enough to
o %

attack the guard fet over this wretched company, as soon as it quitted Paris.
He foresaw the impediment that would arise for want of money, and without giving me time to answer him, he put into my hands a purse containing an hundred pistoles. This perhaps. Said he, may be of use to you: when you are efta blilhed in your fortune you Shall repay me: ^ mean time be altured it is much at your /ervice, and if my reputation permitted me to be seen in such an affair, my arm and my Sword Should be equally at your command.

This friendly and generous procedure
affested me extremely; and 1 thanked him in every term of acknowledgment that my depressed spirits left me the power to express. I then asked is he thought anything could be done by im terceffion, with the Lieutenant of the Police? De Tiroux answered, that he had thought of it, but was afraid it would not avail; because on what pretence could we ask such a favour of a grave and austere magiftratef Whatever hope there was, he thought, must be in trying to prevail on old Gevres de Malleville and my father to apply to him themselves for a .revocation of the sentence; and offered his Services towards gaining young De Malleville: though he observed, that since our unfortunate manoeuvre, he (young De Malleville)
, was grown very cool towards him, and

seemed to Sufpest him of having been party concerned. However he did not wholly despair of prevailing on him, and advised me to attempt persuading my father,
I
Heavy was this task to me; hot only because I saw so very little hope of 'gaining my point, but becaiffe I astually knew not how to approach him : for I had left his lodgings contrary to his positive orders; and I was determined. Since I had heard the destiny of Manon, tiot to return thither again,
I had reason to believe, that on the least Suspicion in regard to Manon he would confine me again, and carry me into the country by force, as he had done besore: for though I was now no longer a child, I knew that my age was no

defence against force, exerted under
/
parental authority. For this reason I could not think of hazarding my person in his hands; but resolved to appoint a meeting with him in Some public garden, and to announce myself to him as a stranger.
De Tiroux went to Gevres de Malk" ville, and I to the Luxembourgh; from whence I sent a melsage to my father, signifying that a gentleman of his acquaintance desired the honour of a Sew moments conversation. As it was late, I doubted whether he would come: Soon after, however, I Saw him approach, attended by a Servant; a precaution which Such a message required. When we met, I desired him to go with me to a retired part of the garden, and. we walked about an hundred paces without

I went to him, and desired he would give me leave to pass the night in his room; for 1 had never thought of procuring myself a lodging, and it was now folate I knew not where dse to go.
He expressed great pleasure at Seeing me once more at liberty, and offered me all the Services in his power. I told him how I was situated, and the assistance I wanted; and though he Saw the various hazards that attended Such an undertaking, he was generous enough to engage in it, and sanguine enough to believe he could Surmount them.

We employed part of the night in digesting our plan; and he Seemed to think that the three Soldiers who had besorc' been of his party might be depended upon. De Tiroux had insormed me; that the guards appointed for the wagons, in one of which Manon was to go, were only six; and we concluded that five of us. La Ferronaye, myself, and the three Soldiers, would be equal to six men, who probably would consult their own sasety more than fulfilling their charge. As I had money enough, La ferronaye advised me to Spare none to promote my success. We must have horses provided. Said he, and each of us his muficet and a brace of pistols; all which, and Some other preparations, he undertook to stave ready the next morning; as well as to procure common clothes for our Soldiers, who dared not
appear
[ 134 J
ft
appear in the uniform of their reg® ment.
For the purpose of paying for these things, I gave him the hundred pistoles that De Tiroux had lent me, and he expended the whole in procuring what he thought requistte. The fpldiers passed in review before me;, and I endeavoured to animate them by promifesthe better to confirm which, I gave each of them ten, pistoles.
The day of astion being come, I sent one of them very early to the hospital,,
we might be qctte sure of the moment of the convoys departure from, thence: and. tho’ this precaution seemed 'to arise from excels of anxiety,, I afterwards, found it absolutely necessary. I thought it postible that some.

false information as, to their route migstt: have been given me; for I believed they were to embark at Rochelle, and that, therefore I was misinformed in being told
I ought to wait for them on the road to. ' Orleans. On the return of the soldier, however, I received positive assurances. that this iinhappy company were to be carried thro’ Normandy, and toi embark at Havre de Grace for America.
$
We took different ways to our rendezvous, which was to be without the gate St. Honore. We met accordingly,, with our horses fresh and in good condition 5 and after waiting about ten minutes, we saw the wagons come slowly along, filled with the miserable women you Saw at Paffy two years ago: a sight that almost deprived me of my senses.
ph fate! cried I; inexorable fate! which

has hitherto pursued me! grant me vie tory, or complete your cruelty by my
death 1. But let me not Survive and sail!
\
We eonserred a moment on the best method of beginning our attack; and Suffered the carriages to proceed about two hundred yards before us: I thought that by crossing a little field, round which the road turned, we could throw ourselves between the guard and the wagons; and La Ferronaye was of my opinion. I Spurred on my horse, cagerly; ^ but my evil genius still prevailed : The guard Seeing five horsemen coming towards thern, believed they Should be attacked, and turned to desend themselves with, a resolute air: making ready their bayonets and. pointing their pieces.

At this sight, which only animated me and La Ferronaye to begin the attack, the three cowardly associates lost all dispofition to engage; and stopping, as if by agreement,, turned their horses round, and rode back towards Paris Sull Speed. La Ferronaye checked his horse, and Seemed as much hurt as I was at this desertion. What are we about. Said he? ’tis desperation for pa to think of attacking these Six mem Rage and despair had deprived me of my voice. I stopped; not knowing whether I stiould pursue the poltroons who had fled, or proceed to attack the guard: could I have done both, and had my power been equal to my rage, ^, I Should have destroyed thern all.
La Ferronaye who judged of what passed in ray mind by the wildness of my

eyes, and the agitation of my whole frame, besought me to hear him:
As we are only two, said he, it would be madness to attack these Six men,
who are as well armed as ourselves, and Seem determined to dispute their ground: we must return to Paris, and endeavour to find other aflbciates who will better perform their engagements: these wagons can go but slowly, and we Shall easily overtake them. I rc fiested a moment on this proposal:
but Seeing only despair before me, I determined to embrace it in its most
ft
decisive form; and dismifling La Ferronaye, to. beseech the guard to receive me among them, and suffer me to accompany their unhappy charge to Havre, and thence to Sail to ame rica.
All

All mankind, said T to La Ferronaye, persecute or betray me; and from henceforth I will depend on them no longer, I now expest nothing either from chance or aftiftance: my wretchedness is complete; and nothing remains but to Submit. I theresore relinquish all hope, and bid you adieu! imay your kindness be rewarded; while I go to consummate my undoing, and voluntarily throw myself into the abyss before me! He exhorted me to think better of it, and to return to Paris: but I told him my resolution was fixed, and begged him to leave me immediately, least the guard should believe we still meditated an attack.
He departed: and I rode slowly up to the guard, with an air of So much Sorrow, and Such consternation in my

Said I, addressing them; sofar am I from' coming to you with hostile intentions, that I come to ask a Savour of you: go on without apprehension, and I will tell you my request. When they knew what I desired, they consulted together a moment, and then he who Seemed to' be the principal among them. Said in the name of them all, that although the orders they had received in regard to' their prisoners were extremely strist, ' I appeared to be So much of a gentleman that they would venture to relax a little in my Savour;, but as they ran a risk, and incurred a hazard of pnnifh ment is it stiould be known, they Should expest: to be paid for it.

I had concealed my particular attach^ ment, and he believed it was merely a youthsul frolic that induced me to desire to be admitted among those unsortunate creatures; but as Soon as he discovered the violence of my pastion for.

a little straw, with a heavy chain round her waist:; her head leaning against the fide of the wagon: her face was pale, and wet with tears, which slowly fell from under her eyelids, for her eyes were closed.

So brilliant and blooming, had lost its lustre; but amidst all this overwhelming misery, the sweetness and toftness of her countenance still remained. The elegance of her frame was visible even in ruins.
Overcome by her sufferings, stie no / longer noticed anything. She opened not her eyes, notwithstanding the noise made by the guard when they apprehended our falling on them; and when I joined them, I rode for sometime by her stde, gazing on her with sensations of Such horror that I was several times in danger of dropping from my horse; but She Saw me not.

For Some moments we could neither of us express our mournful Sentiments; and when Manon attempted it, her voice was So faint that Ihe could not articulate her words. In tremulous and broken accents Ihe tried to Say that she thanked me for not having forgotten her; for being So good as to let her see me once more before Ihe died: but when I protested that nothing Should divide us

hear her say Ihe loved me, was happiness which I would not have exchanged for any blciting prosperity could give. I had lost all that mankind calls good; but the heart of Manon was mine, and I envied nobody. Whether I lived in Europe or America, was a matter of indifference
ta
if I could but live with her: wherever ihe was, was my country; and I thought any part of the universe would afford an asylum to two such hearts as our’s. But the fear of encountering the hardships of extreme penury, was still terrible when I considered the weakness and delicacy of Manon. I represented to myself our Situation in an uncultivated region, where the conveniences of life are wholly unknown, and even its. necessaries hard to be procured among the Savage inhabitants. What was to become of Manon? And yet, said those Savages are less inhuman
than

than my father and old De Malleville: they will not divide us, for they know no laws but those of nature : their hearts are not hardened by avarice like De malleville’s, or debauched by a false principle osimaginary honour, like that of my father. I Should therefore, I thought, be content to live with them, far Srorri, a country where I had experienced only cruelty and injullice; but how Should I, procure for Manon the decencies, or even the absolute requisites of life? I knew from Sad experience how dreadful
it was to See a beloved objest Suffering
/
under poverty; and I trembled to think of what Should become of her. The little money 1 had, would be gone by the extortion of the guard long before I could reach Havre; but I imagined that by obtaining a small supply, I might be able to do something in America, where money

is scarce, that would procure us a fubsish ence. This consideration made me write
I
to Tiberge from the first town we stopped at: I told him I was going to Havre with Manon, whose unhappy sentence he had heard: but I cannot, said I, part with her without making every effort to soften the horrors of her fate; and sttuated as Ihe now is, you see, Tiberge, it will be the last time I shall have occasion to importune you, either on her behalf or my own: enable me then to administer to her Such comforts as her wretched Situation will allow; and it will diminish the regret and remorse that will for ever prey on my heart. I destred him to direst to me at the post house at Havre.

The guard had by this time re doubled their demands; for they Saw that my
attachment
[ h9 3
attachment was such as left me no consideration for anything but Manon, Time was no longer measured by hours, I sat whole days beside her, supporting
9
her, and trying to re animate her finking Spirits with hopes I did not feel myself: but the time I passed thus, coll me So much, that my purse was Soon empty; and then I Saw myself exposed to the, brutality of those unfeeling wretches, who treated me with inconceivable insolence. You was a witness to their inhumanity at Paffy, where your generous pity was so seasonably exerted in my favour, and enabled me to go on much less wretchedly; for the guard, in consequence of what you vrere So good as to Say to them, kept their word better than I dared hope, till we reached Havre.

After being at sea. about two months with favourable weather, we Saw the stiore to which we were bouiid, and our first view of it gave us but a melancholy impression.

yet only the beginning of autumn. Neither men or cattle appeared about the beach; but the captain having fired two guns, we soon afterwards saw a Small body of people appear (inhabitants
V /
New Orleans,) who testified their fatisfastion on feeing the ship; and when we landed, received us as brethren come to share their banished and forlorn state; and as we walked with them to their town, which we had not seen from the Sea, as it lay behind a rihng ground, they ashed numberless questions on the state
\
of France when we left it; and each

When we drew near New Orleans, I was surprised to find that what I had

We were presented to the governor immediately on our arrival; who spoke sometime with the captain alone, and then came to look on the women brought
O
in his vestel. There were thirty of them:

for after you saw us, another party joined us at Havre, The governor, after some reflestion, dirested several young men of the town to be sent for, and the prettiest of the women he gave to them for

He invited us to Sup with him; during which repast I found his manners and conversation superior to what I expested

4
as we.were, Manon and I exerted our
4
selves to appear to advantage. When supper was over, he ordered us to be €ond listed to the house he had had prepared Sorus; where we found a miserable hovel, built of planks and mud, containing three Small divisions on the ground floor, with a granary above them; whither the governor had Sent three or four chairs, a table, a bed and a few other necessaries.

- Manon was terrified; and as soon as we were alone, sat down and wept bitterly. But I understood that it was for me alone She felt: that she was shocked only to think of what I must: suffer in a state so distant from that to which I was born; and that she again accused herself for having been the cause of my feeling this dreadful reverse of fortune.
I affested therefore an air of indifference as to our habitation, and assumed the ’appearance of cheerfulness. What have I to complain of? Manon, said 1; do not you love me; and is not that all that is necessary for my happiness!
Trust to Providence, my angel; and be assured we shall find our circumstances less desperate than we expested. The governor you See treats us with civility, and distingiiishes us from the rest. He

will not Suffer us to want Support; and as to the poor appearance of our cabin, and the meanness of our furniture, what. does it lignify? Nobody here is better provided: and besides you are an admirable chymiil, who have the art of turning everything about you into gold.
Ah! how rich would you be if I had! retiirned Ihe. As there never was love such as your’s, soit is impossible that gratitude and tenderness can exceed what 1 feel for you. I now know myself well.

I now ask no more of you! The heart of Manon is shine! Mine! such as I ever willed to postess it! Such as alone can constitute my felicity;; and my happiness is assured!
I went to steep with these charming ideas, which had the power to change my humble hut into a palace, and the dreary wilderness of America into a paradise. We did not want astual necessaries
; and every day we became more

no jealousy embitters it; but love reignr alone in all his charms. Let others seek gold in the new world, we have found an happiness, compared to which all other treasures are poor.
We astiduolifly cultivated the gover
%
nor’s good opinion; and after a few months, he had the goodness to give me a small employment in the fort, that became vacant; not very profitable in deed, but enough to enable us to live without being troublesome to anybody.
I took a servant for Manon, and a valet for myself, Our little housliold altumed a fettled appearance: our conduct was regulated, and our time palted tranquilly. We were ever happy in an opportunity of affording assistance to our neighbours; which friendly disposition, and the softness of our manners, acquired

Innocent and peaceable as our days now pasted, it insenstbly brought back lo our minds those ideas of religion in which we had both been educated. Never, amidst: all my libertinism, had I been guilty of impiety, or added a renunciation of my principles to the corruption of my manners. Passion and inexperience alone had been the cause of our errors, and not depravity of heart.
We were indeed still young; Manon being only in her twenty-first year, and I only two years older: but our sufferings had the effect of age, and had
taught

taught us to refied. Our conversation continually took a Serious turn'; and we vere insdired with an inclination to

Sandify our union by marriage. I proposed it to Manon, whose heart I knew was candid and sincere; qualities which ever lead to virtue. I told her that nothing was now 'wanting to our happiness, but that Heaven Should approve it. Our hearts are not formed, said I, to live in continual violation of our duty: for though we did So in France, where we could neither be legally united, or cease to love, yet here we

After the conversation that I have just related with Manon, I went to the governor to desire him to consent to our
f
marriage : this however I Should not have
%
done, if I had dared to flatter myself that his almoner who was the only priest in the town, would do me the kindness to perform the ceremony without his leave: but knowing I could not hope for his Secrecy or compliance, I thought it better to make no mystery about it. I found the governor accompanied only by his nephew; and as i had no reason to conceal what I had to say from him, I addressed myself to his uncle in his presence;; recounted a part of my history,
to which he listened with complaisance
\
when I besought him to consent to what I, asked, he not only assured me of his ready concurrence, but that he would
himself be at the expense of the festival vol, II H which
k
C >7° ]

which he would order in honour of the wedding. I went home well content with the success of my ernbalty.
The nephew of the governor, whose name was Synnelet, was extremely beloved by his uncle, whose only relation ' he was. He was about thirty years old; brave, but paltionate and violent. He was unmarried; and I found asterwards
i
that the charms of Manon had struck him the moment he saw her: and the frequent conversation he had had with her
since, and the extreme beauty which re
* %
health had restored to her, had inflamed his passion to a violent excess; but he had concealed it, believing as everybody else did, that She was really my wise.
t
But he was no Sooner undeceived than
he
ta
/
[ HI ]
he threw off all restraint. I had been. about an hour returned home, when the governor’s almoner came in, as 1 imagined, to give me some advice previous to my marriage : but after a cold compliment, he told me in a few words that he waited on me by the governor’s order, to let me know I must think no more of marrying Mademoiselle Manon, as the governor had other views for her.

S
r
Other views for Manon! exclaimed I,
<
Monsteur L’aumonier! What views? He answered, drily, that I knew that Mademoiselle Manon was sent thither for the Colony, and therefore the governor had a right to dispose of her: believing
, us married, he had forborn to exert his
/
power; but now, as I owned we were noh

he thought proper to give her to Monsieur Synnelet, who was in love with her.
My passion now again conquered my prudence. Regardless of their power, I fiercely ordered the almoner to go out of my house; and told him, that whether Manon was my wise or my miftress, neither the governor, Synnelet, nor the
9
whole colony united, should dare to take her from me.
1 was obliged to communicate to Manon the ill omen’d message I had received; and from many circumstances that we now recolledled, we concluded that Synnelet had long had an intention of appropriating her to himself, but could not till now find an opportunity of Seducing his uncle’s integrity. But

[ 173 ]
what was to be done? He was powerful; we were totally in his power; and were at New Orleans as in a desert; having no resource or protection against his tyranny. Through the dreary country which surrounded us, it was impoiti ble to escape; and though the inhabitants were attached to me, I dared not hope • their succour could redress me: money would be necessary to influence them, and I was poor: but even if I could have prevailed on them to revolt in my favour, which was next to impoffshle,
their success was more than hazardous;
%
and the failure of such an attempt would only encrease my missortune. these Schemes passfed rapidly thro’ my mind. I communicated them to Manon, and then, without waiting her answer, formed others. I thought first of one thing, then
of another, but could determine on

Manon, who attentively watched my eyes and the expression of my countenance, saw the misfortune that threatened us in all its extent; but the agitation she saw mein was such, that Ihe trembled to increase it by expressing her fears.
\
After many abortive designs, I determined to go to the governor, and try to move his pity, by reminding him of his former regard for me, and the refpest: I had ever testified towards him : but Manon opposed my going, and with tears said, Des Grieux, you are going to your death!
I shall See you no more I Ah! rather let me die in your arms, and my life will still end happily! but do not, I implore you,, do not leave me! With great

difficulty, however, I prevailed upon her to consent to my going, and allured her I would almost immediately return to her. Ah! it was not my life, but
J ^
her’s that Heaven demanded! That lovely and tender victim alone could be accepted as an atonement for our offences!
I went to the fort, and found the governor with his almoner. I humbled myself before him to a degree that the whole world ffiould not have bribed me to do if Manon had not been concerned.
I conjured him by every entreaty likely to move an heart which was not made of adamant, to compassionate me: but he was immovable; and I could obtain no other answer than that “he was
t
I
“master of Manon, and that he could “not break the promise given to his “nephew.” Still I determined to keep

my despair within bounds, while moderation was likely to be of use; and 1 only' said, on taking leave, that I could not believe him cruel enough to desire to deprive me of my life, to which I would much sooner consent than to the loss of Manon.
I was too well convinced I had nothing to hope for from this obstinate old man, who was so prejudiced in behalf of his nephew that he would have encountered perdition to gratify any wilh of his. Notwithstanding which,
I resolved to continue acting with all the coolness I could command; determined, if they carried their injustice to the last excess, to make in America one of the most tragical Scenes that love and despair had ever occasioned.

I was’ returning home, meditating on what I had to do, when Fate, determined to hasten my ruin, threw Synnelet in my way; vv^ho easily read in my looks what pasted in my Sotil. I have already Said he had courage, 'which he was now determined to stiew. Coming up to me with a fierce and menacing air, he Said, “Do you, look for. me? I know my “designs are offensive to yon; but Since “I will not relinquish them, it will be necessary for us to measure our Swords. Gome then, let us See who is; ‘‘ to be the happy possessor of Manon, ” '
I answered, that he was right; for that nothing but my death would oblige me. to resign her. We then retired together a short distance from the town, and drew our swords. I wounded and disarmed. him in an instant, which enraged him so.

much that he refused to alk his life, and ' to renounce for ever all pretensions to Manon.
I Should perh^s have been justified in taking it from him; but noble blood Scorns to disgrace itself by taking an ungenerous advantage. I threw him his sword. Let us begin again then, said I; and remember it is to be decisive.
He then attacked me with incredible fury; and as I was by no means expert
t
at the sword, (having had only three months praistice at Paris) he in his turn ran me through the arm; but in consequence of this advantage, and of his increasing pastion, he grew so unguarded, that presting on him, I gave; him a fatal lunge, and run him quite through the body: he staggered a feyv paces, and fell motionless at my feet.
Tho’

[’ '79 ]
Tho’ my first emotion was that of
ft
joy at my victory, yet I.. almost immediately on its cohfequences, and considered that I should be punished without mercy,, and without delay. Knowing the insatuation of the governor for his nephew, I doubted not but that I should meet with instant death as Soon as that of Synnelet should be known. Nor was that the worst of my fears: Manon, abandoned and friend less, in a destolate country, was an idea infinitely more dreadful; So much So, that it almost deprived me of my senses, and made me careless of my immediate sasety.
I hung in Silent horror over the corps

besore me, whole state I envied; for had his
ft
lot been mine I had been delivered from
all my miseries. However the thought
that
[ io ] :
/
that occasioned my greatest: uneafiness, at length roused me to take Some resolution, How! cried I to myself, shall i die to escape from present evil? Is there any evil then greater than the loss of her I love? Ah! let me brave every danger to assist my unhappy girl! it will be always time enough to die, when I have attempted everything in vain!
I went home; where I found Manon half dead with fear and anxiety. At my presence Ihe revived; but the terrible accident that had happened, and which I could not conceal from her, threw her into an agony of terror. Before I had Sinifhed my relation of the death of
t
Synnelet, and the w'onnd I had received, she fell almost lifeless into my arms; and it was more than a quarter of an hour before her fenses returned.

[ 1 ]
I was myself half dead : I saw not the least probability of security for either of us. Manon, said I, as soon. as She Seemed a little recovered, what shall we do? Alas! Whither shall we go? It is necelsary that I immediately quit the town. Will you stay in it? Ah, yes! stay! stay 1 I beseech you! you may yet be happy! while 1 will go to meet death among the Savages of the desart, or in
4
the jaws of some ferocious animal! Weak and trembling, she arose, and catching me eagerly by the hand, led me to the door.. Let us fly, said ssie: the corps of Synnelet may already have been found, and we may a moment hence have no time to escape. But my Soul! replied I, wildly, whither! whither can we go? What resource have we? Would it not be better for you to .endeavour to live here without me, while
I offer

/
[ i82 ]
I offer myself a voluntary victim to the. governor’s fury? This proposal only augmented her anxiety to depart. She went out, and I followed her, having So much presence of mind left as to put a bottle or two of spirits in my pockets, and as much provision as they would hold. We told our servants we were going out for our evening walk; / and we hurried out of the town much, faster than I could have supposed Manon able to walk.
Though I was still in the. most painsul irresolution where to go, two Seeble rays of hope broke a little the gloominess of my despair; without theaffistance of which I Should, have preferred instant death to the dread of what might besall Manon: While I had been in America I had
acquired
[ i83 ]
acquired some knowledge of the country, and was acquainted with the manner in which the Indian nations are conciliated; and I knew I might with certain precautions put myself into their hands without meeting certain dellrudlion. I had learned a little of their manners and customs, and something of their language, in the frequent opportunities I had had of feeing them trading at New Orleans; and added to this melancholy resource, I had hopes of another, which was from the English, who have, as well as ourselves. Settlements in that part of America. But when I considered that to reach their colonies we must traverse immense deserts, unknown to cultivation, and go for many days thro’ woods, never pasted but by the wandering Indians, and over steep and almost inaccestible mountains, a journey which

We walked: on as long as manon’s^ strength would permit : I believe about six miles; for she courageousty resused.

I Should have overwhelmed her with

me, hf I conclude in a few words, a recital that would kill me; an event without example; and of which I halt carry to my grave the bitter remem brance. But though I bear the recollestion of this dreadful scene inceltantly in my bosom, my soul recoils every time I attempt to relate it.
We had pasted a part of the night tranquilly. I thought my beloved Manon slept, and was almost afraid of breathing, least it stiould disturb her, when towards
day[
[ J
ft
daybreak I felt her hands very cold, and found they trembled extremely. 1 ptit them to my bosom: Ihe was fenlible of what i did, and taking my hand, told me in a feeble voice that Ihe believed her last moments were approaching. I thought this language natural, after the fatigue and terror Ihe had undergone; and I endeavoured to comfort and re affure her by the tenderest caresses. But her frequent Short stghs, her Silence when I Spoke to her, and the convulsive catch ings of her hands, which I held in mine, made me too well understand that the end of her miseries was near. ask me not what I then Selt, or what were her last
words. She died! -- -- I Saw her die !- —

above four and twenty hours after her death, I remained with my face close to her cold cheek. I meant to die, and never to quit that posture. But on the beginning of the second morning, I remembered that when I was dead the body of my beloved mistress might become the prey of wild beasts, I determined to bury her, and wait for death on her grave. I was already so exhausted by grief and want of food, that it was with infinite efforts I arose from the ground. I was obliged to have recourse to the cordials I had brought with me, and was resreshed enough to enable me to begin the mournsul office.
The
[ i89 1
The whole plain being a bed of deep Sand, I found it easy to dig, and I broke my sword to remove it; but found my hands more Serviceable; and with great labour, as my weakness obliged me osten to stop, I at length made a deep grave; and having wrapped all my clothes round her, to prevent the Sand from touching her, I placed in it the idol of my soul;
after having embraced her a thousand
/■
and speaking to her as if fly was
yet alive. But having deposited her in
# ^
it, I still hung over her, being unable to Summon resolution enough to throw the earth Tipon her. Feeling however my
ta
weakness return, I feared that death might prevent my performing for her this lass: Sad Service : theresore coliesting all my strength and resolution, I began to fill the grave, and bury in the bosoni of the earth the loveliest and most amiable
\
I
[ 190 ]
ble creature it had ever boasted. Having done this, I laid down on the grave, with my face turned towards the fand which covered her, and shutting my eyes in the hope to open them no more, I implored of Heaven speedily to send me the death I so ardently wished for.
During all this terrible scene, no tear fell from my eyes; no sigh escaped my heart. My senses Seemed locked up in the greatness of my calamity; and post felsed of a steady resolution to die, I uttered no complaint, nor shed any outward symptom of the horror and consternation of my soul. After having lain Some time in the manner I have described, I lost all recollestion, and felt my misery no longer.
The rest of my melancholy story is hardly worth your attention. The body

of Synnelet being carried to the town, and his wounds examined, it was Sound he was not only alive, but that none of his wounds were mortal. He told his uncle ingenuously what had happened, and had generosity enough to do justice to my condust. An inquiry was immediately made for me; but I was gone. It was too late to Search for me out of the town that night; and for two days ‘ their endeavours to find me did not Suey

ceed: but on the evening of the third I was discovered on the grave of Manon; senseless, almost without clothes, and covered with blood frorn^ my wound: and those who found me imagined from
ta ^ o
my appearance that I had been robbed
\
and murdered. They carried me as well as they could towards the town; and the motion brought me to myself. The Sighs and groans I uttered on finding

iftg myself still among the living, first: informed them I might be restored by their astistance; dn giving me which they Succeeded but too well. But notwithstanding my deplorable condition, I was Sent to prison, and closely confined in a dungeon; for when Marion could nowhere be found, they believed I had
killed her in a transport of jealous rage,
/
As Soon as I was able, I recounted Simply and naturally all that I remembered to have happened; and truth had its effest. Synnelet, unhappy as the event had made him, was generous enough to interest himself for me, and obtained my release : but I was So weak,
4
that when they took me from my dungeon I was carried to bed, where I lay for three months. Sometimes sensible, but oftener in an happy sorgetfulness of all my Sorrows.
When

[ 193 ]
When I poflcssfed my recollestion, life grew more and more infiipportable to me, I called perpetually on death, as the only end of my misery;; when I had the power to refuse, I refused all succour. But Heaven having so severely punished me, now suffered me to profit
f
from its chaftisement, The remembrance of what I had been, and what I ought to be, returned; and as my yoiith and
a very good constitution in Spite of my
«
afflistion, by degrees Surmounted my dis ease, reason returned with returning health. I entered again on the duties of my employment, waiting still a vesstel should arrive from France, which is ex.. there only once a year, I resolved to return to my native country, and by my Suture condust endeavour to repair the errors of my former lise.

Manon I could now do no more : during my illness Synnelet had taken care to have her remains removed to the town,
and interred in the church with every mark of refpest.
About six weeks after I left my bed,
I was walking alone on the beach, and discovered a Sail, which I found to be a
ft
small velsel come to trade at New Orleans.
I stood to see the debarkation, and with extreme surprise Saw Tiberge among thole who came on Ihpre. This faithful friend knew me afar off; though grief and illnels had very much altered my appearance.
He embraced me, with tears, and told me the only motive of his voyage was to try to engage me to return to France.
As soon as he received my letter, he Set out hiiiiself to bring me the assistance I
desired[

pirate, and carried to one of their islands
\
whence with great difficulty he escaped, and after various accidents got on board the little Hoop which now so happily landed him at New Orleans.

him of all that had happened since we quitted France; and he heard me with extreme joy declare that the rudiments of virtue 1 derived from him, were now likely to produce permanent effests; he assured me that such a hope repaid him for all the fatigue he had undergone.
We waited two months before a ship from France arrived at New Orleans, in which we embarked, and landed at Havre a fortnight Since; when I imme diately wrote to my family; but by the answer I have received from my brother,
I learn the rn'burnfiil news of my father’s death, and I shudder to inquire whether it' has not been hastened, if not occasioned by my ill condust.
