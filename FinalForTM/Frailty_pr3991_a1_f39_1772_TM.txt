the little embellishments which can be procured to render it agreeable to young minds naturally addicted to pleasure.

No, child: I know better than to read grave lectures to a rattle pate, and to talk nonsense to a man of reason. Ever while you live, Sophy, regulate your behaviour agreeably to the understandings and manners of the persons with whom you converse : make yourseif quite easy with your company, and you will then find yourself happy in their Society. For my part, I have no idea of being ridiculoussy prim with people. I love to take them as they are : if you attempt to lay them under any restraints, yon lost an infinite deal of diversion. I always abhorred the stightest restraint; and therefore wish not to impose restrictions upon others.

WHAT a mad cap you are,
Clara! but that is too weak a word — however, I am not willing to be too warm with my remonstrances at
first : mild measures are Sometimes
^ *
more efficacious than violent ones; and, Were I to prefer the latter to the former, I should be guilty of the very fault for which I condemn you. Indeed, my dear girl, you are too giddy, too volatile, and your carelessness with regard to your conduct (for I know not how to believe you intentionally indiscreet) will, I am afraid, be attended with some consequences detrimental to your reputation, and destructive of your peace: the

w

loss of the one is generally followed by the loss of the other: but though you are too lively to think of consequences, I should not act the part of a Sincere friend, did I not warn you against the danger wherewith you are threatened.
How can a little harmless flirtation be dangerous ?” you will Say. It is more dangerous than you suppose it to be, my dear: remember the Fable of the Moth and the Candle — Yet I will do you the justice to believe that you only mean to amuse yourself: but take care: by trifling with Such a handsome, insinuating fellow as Beverly is, you throw yourself into a hazardous situation. You call him a Rattlepate : he is not So thoughtless as you imagine him to be; he knows what he is about: he will play with you till he sees you off
your guard; and then all is over with
you.

you. I look upon Such a man as beverly to be infinitely more dangerous than many men who appear suspicious in your eyes; against whose designs you are Secure from your apprehensions concerning them. With regard to Beverly your exceshve carelessness will pave the way for your ruin. You mean nothing by your inconsiderate carriage, I am pretty well assured, but a little amusement: : artful fellows, however, more sharp lighted than you, are always ready to take advantage of what you call trifling. besides, you make them too familiar, and encourage them not only to hope for, but to Seize freedoms which ought not to be Suffered; freedoms which you may always prevent by a behaviour properly reserved, though you cannot So well quarrel about them after your permission of them; as you
B 4 must.

must, necessarily, by So doshg,. draw.. upon yourself a great deal of merited raillery. — The men against whom you discover your resentment, after having imprudently encouraged them, will have much to urge in their favour, and they will find the world more disposed to give credit to them than to you. Sensible of Such advantages, they are perfectly indifferent about what you Say of them, and about what you endure on their account. Be wise, therefore, in? time, my dear girl, if you would be esteemed and respected; nay, if you would be admired. Keep up your own importance; and hinder the fellows from making encroachmients, by the propriety of your behaviour, if you would show any regard for the advice of
Your ever affection ate friend,

WHAT have I ever done to
you, George, to make you affront my understanding, by Supposing me capable of being duped by a woman?? I not declared, have I not Sworn Solemnly a thousand and a thousand times, that I would as Soon commit murder as matrimony? and yet you have ventured to question my veracity, and to fix upon Clara Wroughton as a woman powerful enough to shake my

resolution. — What, in the name of wonder, induces you to fancy that she is
•
more shrewd, more Sagacious, than the rest of her Sex? For my part, I have always looked upon her as I look on other women. She differs from the majority of them only by Superior beauty, and Superior sense. — Yet sense will not Signify a sixpenny piece when once a woman is in love, heartily in love. I have ever found those women the most cried up for their fine sense., See. See. the most violent in their passions, and, consequently, the most ready to give a free indulgence to them. Now a fool is neither capable of giving delight, nor of receiving it. Clara has, perhaps, more wit and humour than half her Sex put together, and also a strong propensity to pleasure. A woman with shining talents must keep company to show
them I

them; and if she happens to fall into right hands, that is, into the hands of those who know how to make the most of her, she will Soon be as ready, I will venture to affirm it, to give pleasure, as to receive it. By conversing with an unbounded freedom, she lays herself open to attacks of all kinds; and a man must have very bad luck indeed, if he does not catch her Sometimes uncuard
O

I Sicken at the bare idea of it. Not that I had always So strong an aversion to the marriage state: the truth is, I have, within these Sew years, seen— — connected with — So many pliant wives,

that — the Lord have mercy upon their husbands— — Say no more. these are not marrying times, Sommers. I had rather be hanged, methinks — though one cannot, to be Sure, die, genteelly,, in a halter — than be a husband. Who in his Sober senses would venture upon? a wife in this refined age? The women Seem, by their actions, to be influenced by a Set of notions So totally un domc stic* — though extremely fashionable, I will allow — that matrimony may be abolished as a very useless ceremony. — I think, therefore, that I am in no Sort of danger; for, certainly, you will not So far suspect the soundness of my intellects, as to suppose me desirous of herding with

No, no, George: I am too knowing to

long liege, I shall be immerssely mistaken in her. She who is ever ready to encourage freedoms, and never unwilling to repress them, must Surrender, ^ in a stiort time, to the man she likes. You understaad me. — Now whether Clara Wroughton looks upon me as an irresistible fellow, I cannot pretend to say; but I am Sure she has, an infinite deal of sensibility. She Seems, indeed, to plume herself upon her elevated ideas : but I have known many of your Sentimental misses full as coming as those
honest girls who do not pretend to have
\
any minds at all. — I cannot tell, indeed, whether the former are not more suscep tible of the tender passion than the latter; whether they do not love with

SOPHY, you are a simpleton. Why, child, can you possibly imagine, that I do not know what I am about? Do you imagine that I shall let Beverly, or any other man, make a fool of me?

To Speak freely, and truly, Sophy,, you have not reflected upon this affair with your usual Sagacity; but I have not leisure, at present, to enter into a

From the same to the Same.
I
I H A V E hardly opened my eyes, Sophy; and yet I cannot help sitting down to tell you what a delightful evening I had. Such a partner! — I talked of Beverly; but who could cast - a single glance at him, when Sir Edward Stanly appeared? What a figure, take him altogether! what a height! what a shape! what grace in his motions! what an animated complexion! what fine dark languishing eyes! what hair • what teeth! Gh! — he was made for the destruction of half our Sex! — I mean, Sophy — pray do not mistake me — ’to
captivate
sho  .
captivate the hearts of half the women in England : and is not a man who has
O
Sure and fast hold of your heart dangerous enough in all conscience! — But to this Sir Edward.
There is no describing Sir Edward. I cannot do justice to his easy mien, nor the becoming negligence of his manner. But there is an intolerable non chalance in his behaviour, apparently arising from his believing himself of Sufficient conse quence to win all hearts by his neglect.. There will be Some glory in a conquest over Such a man. But as he happens to know that he is So enchanting a creature, he will not very easily Surrender, I fancy. However, I will try my power. From this moment, ye Beverlys, -, c. See. — rye Soft, Supple, simple.. Sighers, adieu! give place to the elegant, the amiable Stanly. N
%

 . 21
thing will I leave undone to fix him in my train: nothing will I neglect to make him absolutely, Serioussy in love with me. I do not tell you, Sophy, that I will ever be in love with him: remember that, my dear; and yet, when I look in his face — what a divine pair of eyes the wretch has i — But I must cure him of his less conceit. — I detest a fellow who behaves like a Narcissus. Thole
r
handsome devils are so apt, like fine women, to be vain. — Beverly is reckoned handsome, you know: he is nobody compared to Stanly, who is as much the man of sense, as he is the man of fashion, and the man of taste. I could not think of dancing with Beverly, you know, when Such a fellow. So much Superior to him, appeared. The very instant I beheld him, I began to consider how I should shake off Beverly, — Now
you,
f
£2  .
pou, I suppose, would have made a fuss about your promise, and Such nonsense. — Where is the woman in her wits who ever kept her word with a man? I know better, Sophy: and So, as I was Saying, I immediately Seemed not to See Beverly, though he was fiddling about me all the time : he was resolved, however, not to be neglected, and, therefore, claimied my hand. — I drew it back in a hurry. — “Hold, Sir, ” cried I, with a look Sufficient to turn him into stone. — “I have changed my mind. I have not determined wshether I shall dance or no.’* “True woman, ” replied she, with a half smiling, half angry face; “fickle as the wind.”
Or we should not resemble your Sex, Sir, ” answered I, in the most good-humoured accents. “But as I am So changeable an animal, Mr. Beverly, it
would
F E M A L E F R AI L T Y. ag
i
would be downright cruelty to keep you in suipense, and to deprive any other Lady of so excellent a partner.’*
There I Sweetened him, Sophy, till he hardly knew how to ansv/er me. So. bewitching is flattery! — In short, I never knew flattery fail. — The man could have beat me but just before: on a Sudden his note was changed.
“Dear miss Wroughton, as I looked
4
upon myself as engaged to you, I will wait your time.”
“Oh, no — by no means, Mr. Beverly: and here is a young i^ady” — presenting the lovely, blushing Garlies to him —
“who will, I dare Say, be pleased to have a good partner recommended by me.”
The creature fixed his eyes upon her ■ instantly (you know his eyes, Sophy, they are very Sparkling) and the youth,
beauty,
*

%
beauty, and fimpiicity of miss Garlies fpowersully combined to charm shim; he was fairly taken in in a moment, I was vastly delighted to See my design Successful; which was, to engage Garlies, lest
ft
Stanly should take a fancy to her, and to Secure him to myself. The latter part of my design was not So easily to be accomplished: however, I carried my point, at lash — When he came near me, I threw as much decent encouragement into my looks as I thought necessary; and then Said, in a loud whisper, to Nancy, I think, my dear, my headache is gone off. — You cannot take it ill, Mr. Beverly, ” added I, “if I go down one dance; Since I shave provided So amiable a partner for you.” — He bowed to me, as much as to Say, — You may go to the devil, if
you
9

 . 25
you please” — pressing the fair garlies’s hand at the Same time.
Sir Edward then advancing, idly leaning upon Lord falkland’s shoulder. Said, “As your Spirits and inclination are returned, Madam, will you give me leave to lead you into the Set? ”
I Smiled consent. My hand was in his in a moment, Sophy; and it was the Softest hand I ever felt: No man ever had a Softer. He dances, as he does everything else, I believe, with infinite ease, with a grace peculiar to himself. His behaviour was that of an accomplished gentleman, there was not the (lightest appearance of the coxcomb in it. His address was perfectly polite; but there ‘was not the Smallest Spark of gallantry in it: Not a single flattering Speech dropped from his lips the whole evening; and
r
yet his carriage was So particular to me, vol. I. C that
N
• •
26  .
\
that envy was excited in the bosom of every woman, and jealousy in the breast of every man who had distinguished me before.
Beverly, though Seemingly very much attached to his partner, watched us pretty closely; and from his looks I conjectured (more than from any singularity in Sir edward’s behaviour to me) that he thought Sir Edward had no aversion to me. Yet there is a carelessness in his manner which, while it pleases — everything he does must please — makes me imagine that the woman who wishes to keep him as a lover will have a troublesome talk. A man So completely formed to charm must be conscious of his power, and, undoubtedly, eiesirous of exerting it. — But I have almost tired my hand in writing about him, and yet I cannot compose my mind to think upon any
other
 , if
other Subject. — A bad Symptom this! — I would give the world now to know what this enchanting fellow's reflections are just at this time. I am only prompted by curiosity; nothing elle, Sophy, believe me. My heart is still my own, thank heaven, and I am,
As truly as ever,

Few women excel her, not only in beauty — that alone would not fix me — but in Something more attractive— — of which I can neither give a definition, nor a description. She is’enchanting to a degree beyond expreshon. She is rather tall; she has a fair complexion; and very fine dark blue eyes which are in general charmingly Iparkling, but Sometimes a tender languor is cliscovera>* ble in them, which touches the Soul. Her nose is aquiline; her lips are inviting : her teeth are Srnall, white and even; her auburn hair grows in the greatest luxuriance, and naturstly inclining to curl, does not require the frequent attendance of the hairdresser— — hate to

Yet with ail these excellencies there is art Small tendency in her to flirtation. — Well — a little may, perhaps, be allowed: it gives a Spirit to the features, enlivens the con plexion, and shows the whole woman to advantage — but then it frequently makes a woman vain, capricious, insolent, trifling indeed, and Sometimes in a humour to which no man of shnse can Submit.

miss EVELYN.
Beverly has been with me. “I suppose, ” cried he, “that you in tend to have nothing farther to say to me, as you have made a' conquest of Sir Edward Stanly.”
r Smiled in his face— — could not help it, and replied with another question. “Have I then made Sure of the charming fellow, Beverly? How you transport
diner“
“expected this, ” Said he— — are you Serious ?’*
“Never
ft
 . 35;
Never more foin my life, *’ answered I: “How can you think I am in jest? Has not Sir Edward wit, sense, eyes, teeth, hair, elegance, and taste enough to touch a woman’s heart ?’’
“So have other men, ” replied he, Sullenly, and yet women keep their hearts unaffected. For my part, I Sometimes doubt wshether a woman has any heart at all.”
“Ay, I suppose you are an unbeliever, but we have certainly hearts : I feel mine at this very instant, in a terrible bustle.”
Just as I had uttered these words, Sir jedv^ard entered the room, and So unexpectedly,. that I felt my face in a glow; that sensation considerably increased my ' embarrassment, and it was not lessened by beverly’s behaviour upon the occasion, who fixed'his eyes very Saucily upon me.

Sir Edward either did not, or would not, through po’hteness, appear to see how much I was disconcerted: (What a difference is there in men, Sophy?) — But that wretch Beverly — who owed me a grudge in my preferring Sir Edward to him — turning to him. Said, “I would give a good deal, Stanly, to have Seen yov here a few minutes Iboner., Some very flattering things have been Spoken concerning you” — (throwing his large eyes full towards
“Had they been Serious truths, Beverly, ” replied Sir Edward, “I should have esteemed myself both honoured, and happy in having heard them; but flattery, tho’ it may tickle the ear a little,

can never give any real Satisfaction to those who really wish to appear amiable to their acquaintance, ’*

“If your wishes are Sincere then, ” Said

Beverly, “they will Soon be granted; for miss Wroughton has declared more in your favour already than she ever did in any man’s, though after a long acquaintance with him.”
The wretch! — I coloured again.
Sir Edward bowed. To prevent his actually imagining, from what Beverly had blundered out, that I really was in love with him, I replied — “Sir edv/ard must make allowance for the vivacity of his friend, who (as his volatile Ipirits will not give him time to lee, things as they are) is very apt to put a wrong construction on themd’
“It would have been very happy for me, madam, ” Said Sir Edward, with a Smile, “if he had not been mistaken here.’*
He

He then turned the conversation, though I Saw plairily that he was extremely pleased: I suppose I showed no Small Satisfaction with my eyes, for Beverly looked quite out of humour all the evening. Sir Edward, however, made a little apology to my aunt, when she came down, for his appearance in her diningroom; telling her, that as he had had the honour of dancing with me at Soho, betook the liberty of calling to know
howl did.
Mrs. Morden who is, I will allow — though she frequently lectures me — na turally civil, received his compliment very gracioufiy, and when he was gone. Said he was a genteel well-bred man.
During his stay, which was by no means tedious, I rallied Beverly for not
having made any inquiry after miss Garlies.
** How

“How do you know, ” replied he, “that I have not been to see her? I as sure you I never rriet So much amiable Simplicity and So much beauty united. Are not you of my opinion, Sir Edward ?** — turning to him.
Miss Garlies is handsome, replied he carelesty, and has a naivete that is pleasing enough, but I confess I think she wants vivacity; when a handsome woman’s features are animated, she appears still more beautiful.
I am that wofnan — thought I. — Monstrous vanity I — ris it not Sophy but you have been long accustomed to shake your head at me; and yet for all that, child, I cannot help Setting down Stanly as one of my train, though to be Sure the fwect fellow was never formed
«
for a mere dangler; nor will he, I dare affirm, be trifled with. I am almost
afraid,
#
40  . •
afraid, indeed, that he will scarcely con descend to be in love. But we shall see. I have brought down high ipirited fel
g
lows before now, and yet I declare I am Sometimes inclined to despair of this
ft 0
mn. Beverly has done me a great deal
ft
of mischief by giving his friend hopes. Men defpise an easy conquest. I must, therefore, alter my conduct, and play the injenfihle a little; really indifferent no woman can well be about Stanly: She who cannot bring herself to love him, must certainly feel herself greatly flattered by his admiration, as he is a man almost universally adored.

Surely it is impossible— — ought Such a man to be admitted into the Society of women of character. Were they only to mix with the loose, and the abandoned, they would have no opportunity to corrupt the inexperienced, they would be also out of the way of that encouragement which they too often receive from the mod, est among our Sex; an encouragement which proiupts them to make attempts which are too frequently at

WHAT a Sober, Solemn lecture
have you read me, Sophy? and only because I happened to Say that the fellow was handsome, Sensible, elegant, and entertaining, cc. c— — to whatpurpose do you point Such a number of wise sayings at me? Do you imagine, child, that I am so silly as to be caught by the mere outside of a man, tho’ ever so striking, or to be duped by his understanding though ever So keen? —
I thought you had known me better
than
ft
46  .
than to suppose me capable of being charmed out of my reason by his rhetoric, or Seduced from the paths of honour by his cunning. No, Sophy; though the men are bad enough, they cannot
V
make us so, unless we encourage them by our indiscretion. I have always Said, and I will maintain it, that we have only ourselves to blame if we come to any mischief; and, therefore, we are guilty of injustice when we condemn the men;
we are ourselves the aggressors, by
^ *
throwing ourselves imprudently in their way. — Not that we should be too shy, or prudish neither: by an unnecessary reserve we give them a considerable advantage over us, by inducing them to suppose we are asraid of them. By acting in that manner we do them too much honour; we flatter their vanity, and increase their consequence; they then
grow
\
/
#
 . 47
grow insolent, and frequently dangerous. Our apparent fears animate them: presuming on those fears, they fancy they may do what they please with us. — Fcfr ray part I never behave So as to kindle Such presumption in them. No — Sophy. I go quite another way to work — I have not the least reserve — I always stiew myself entirely fearless and unsuspicious, when I am Surrounded with pretty fel
ft
lows; and by laughing both with them, and at them, throw them So much out of their play, that they are puzzled beyond .expreshon. Now I Suppose you call this coquetry; and look upon me as a downright flirt: but indeed, I am not the least bit of a flirt: I am only determined to treat men in their own way, and to be a little upon a par with them if possible; * and that is not to be done by shunning them; by colouring up

when they come into a room, and starting as if a pistol went off at my ear when they go to touch my hand. — Nancy Garlies, dear good girl, bounded, I declare, from Beverly the other night when his lips — accidentally I verily believe — -
J
touched her cheek while he leaned over the back of her chair, as if he had been going to murder her; but her foolish behaviour was occasioned entirely by her ignorance: she will know better another

letter:

letter; if he has been guilty of any unfair practises he must be vile indeed; yet I can hardly think him capable of Such. an action; he has an openness in his appearance — though I will allow him to have too much levity — that makes me believe he has not a bad heart. You See I am willing to think the best of him. — I shall be glad to know whether I am too partial to him or not — I have not yet been deficient in penetration. No man, I imagine, can ever deceive me.

YOU are a strange girl, Clara, and
will never see your danger till it is not in your power to avoid it. — However, to convince you that I have taken pains to open your eyes, I have made a very particular inquiry about Miss Miles the unfortunate young person I mentioned who had been Seduced by Sir Edward. She is the daughter of a clergyman who received his living from the father of Sir Edward, and being a man remarkable for the fineness of his under
D 3’ standing,

standing, and for delicacy of his sentiments,
was uncommonly distinguished
/*
by Sir Henry. Mr. Miles, in return, behaved with much deference, and grateful respect to his patron, and was frequently invited by him to Spend whole days at Stanly hall. — During the visits made by the good clergyman and his family. Sir Edward, then Mr. Stanly, became intimate with Sally Miles; who, with a very pretty person, had a very delicate mind greatly improved by a virtuous education. This Sir Edward, however, Ipared no pains to corrupt the principles strongly inculcated by her amiable father; and, at last, carried her ' off to a little hunting seat about an hour’s ride from the hall. — There he kept her above two years, and then left her to lament her fate alone: there she still remains a prey to melancholy, and despondence,
ft
 . 55
Spondence. — Now, my dear, in my oph nion, the Seduction of this virtuous girl, the only child of so worthy a father, venerable, from his age and infirmities, and highly respectable from his understanding, and his morals; was a flagrant crime, and that Sir Edward is doubly culpable, as he knew that his father always profelsed a particular regard for Mr. Miles, who died about six months after he discovered his daughter’s ruin; - unable, it is thought, to Survive it. This is the story as I have heard it authentically related :. and if you can now Suppose Such a man as Sir Edward, fit to be even trifled with, you pay him a compliment to which I can never fubscribe; for I look upon him as the most abandoned of his Sex, and consequently to be avoided with the greatest circumspection by every virtuous woman. I am, indeed,
D 4 extremely

extremely Surprised to See shch men desirous of associating with Such women; as they, by always endeavouring to make them as vicious as themselves, Sufficiently prove that vicious women are more agreeable to their taste than any others. However, not contented with the number already made to their hands, they chiefly employ themselves to lay Snares for the innocent and unwary; and they not only Seduce them from the paths of virtue, but render them so excessively loose, that — Well — I am amazed that men who have had a genteel education can bear to associate with women, who having lost all sense of Shame, as well as their characters, behave with the most difgustiilg impudence, and strive, with a cruel activity to bring the modest among their Sex upon a footing with them. — Surely no woman who has the least regard for
herself
4
 . 57
herself will condescend to make herself agreeable to any man at the expense of her honour: She who is careless about her reputation is in a fair way, how Strong however her presumption may be, to join the wretched herd whom I have marked out as deterring examples. — If women of character would, with a proper Spirit, discourage all men who make any attempts to draw them into dishonourable situations, fewer of our Sex would be plunged into misery by yielding improperly to those who profess the sincerest attachment to them: how few indeed are absolutely ruined by their flattering lovers but by their own indiscretion!

WHAT a Severe catechism have I
gone through! No inquifitor general ever ashed an unbelieving Jew more questions than Clara has plied me with: and yet her curiosity Smells strongly of inclination; for if she has no thoughts of me, why the devil does she give herself and me so much trouble?

above disguise and will not conceal a Single error, no, not to pnrchase Clara. To say truth, I believe that all this excessive purity is affected. I am tolerably well acquainted with the Lnguage of the eyes; and from the motions of clara’s, I cannot help drawing favourable conclusions. Some women like to be thought chaste, though their looks and actions render their chastity fulpected. However, I do not think that this girl is a hypocrite : She Seems to be a lovely womarii, formed by nature, and very well disposed to give and to receive pleasure; as Such a person I fiiall treat her. — But why am I •taxed with the Seduction of a girl who was intoxicated with her passion for me to Such a degree, that reason — or to use a female word — discretion, had not fair play? I told her So t’other day. She
blushed, and a Smile began to peep out,
but

‘‘ That affected frown upon your brow, Miss Wroughton, ” Said I, is extremely unbecoming.”
“It becomes me as well. Sir, I imagine, as your vanity does youp

myself in a humour to be angry, and So turned off with an affected indifference, which piqued her immensely, I believe; for she called me a careless, indolent creature, and Said I did not deserve a conquest if I would take no pains about it.

To Such a mortification, I do not, I confess, wish to be exposed, I will also confess that I am coxcomb enough. Sometimes, to indulge my vanity at the expense of my other pleasures. There is a sort of character always to be Sustained, particularly at a certain time of life; and I should be loth to put it into any woman’s power to lessen my reputation with the rest of her Sex. — il must, therefore, keep well with Clara at all events, even if I give up a

He Saucily answered, with one of the most bewitching Smiles you ever law, “Few ladies complain of having their favourite passions gratified.’*

I should hate a man without any Spirit: Sir Edward has I fancy a high one; and it will, I doubt not, cost me an infinite deal of trouble to pull it down: and yet I must, Sophy, in Spite of all, your admonitions,, I must have a pluck at it.

almost Spoilt her. She is become as capricious, and as fantastical as any of her Sex can poshbly be; and that is Saying a great deal: Yet, I let her alone, that I may See how far she will go; and that I may insist, in my turn, upon a reasonable allowance of coxcombry, if I shall think it necessary. At present, however, I shall accommodate myself to her plan, which is, I plainly perceive, to enrol me among

the number of her lovers: but she does • not know. She shall not know that I have my caprices. — After all, I never yet met with Such a woman as Clara Wroughton. With her person, her sense, her taste, she is So much Superior to the majority of her Sex, that I can See no charms in any other woman when she is present; and yet Beverly has given her up very quietly for a little blushing country innocent; whose merit is entirely confined to her naivete. Perhaps he delpaired of Succeeding with Clara; So much the better for me, who am determined to try her. I must, however, conduct my manoeuvres with: great address, to prevent their being suspected. I am, at present, in the Seesaw way: this moment I act the infenjtble, the next I appear a little like a lover. — • By this mode of behaviour I draw her

expecting to hear a passionate declaration of my Sentiments, I fly off in an instant, and behave with the utmost indifference. — By this duplicity, this dexterity I have hitherto been very Successful : She actually looks anxious about me: but as her anxiety may proceed from vanity, as well as from a Softer passion, I must take every step I can to discover the real cause of it. I would give half, my fortune to make her as fond of me as Sally Miles was. — If she has any tender feelings in my favour, and is capable of defeating all my artful designs, she will be a glorious girl indeed: but, as I Said before, I can never tie myself for life to a -- -- What shall I call her?

his

his tender fits, so respectful, and So apparently fearful of displeafing me, that even my careful aunt thinks I am quite Safe in his company. “If all your men, Clara, ’* Says she, frequently, to me, “were as civil, as inoffensive, and as obliging as Sir Edward Stanly, nothing could be urged against them — he is So well shred. So polite.” — How Soon has the rogue insinuated himself into the good old lady’s favour! Yet we all have our blind Sides; and tho’ you Sober folks are so ready to find out faults in your neighbours, you are Sometimes taken in as well as we giddy ones.

My considerate aunt very prudently declares before the men, that they cannot take too much care to keep us up, that is, according to her meaning, out of mischief. I wish people would mind their own bufiness. pur mothers and aunts are always telling us, that women in former days had ^ not hstf the opportunities to be wicked, which they have now; not half fomany public diversions: no Ranelaghs, Soho assemblies,, nd Coteries. — To confess, the truth, I dp - not imagine that Such

allow that they do any great harm. those who are strongly addicted to pleasure will always get at it if they poshbly can, in Some way or other; and those who are naturally Sober and virtuous, will remain So amidst all the allurements with which they are Surrounded. I dare lay my life, that though our parents and relations were not exposed to Such perpe petual dissipation as we are, they were sty, and had their private Satisfactions. Some folks, indeed, tell us, that it is better for us to conceal our vices if we have any, than to publish them, as example is powerful: but for my part, Sophy, I declare, I have a mortal aversion to hypocrisy. — There is, in my opinion, a meanness beyond expreshon, in affecting to be Superior in goodness to everybody ' E 3 else,

I Thought to have been with you ere now, but am detained here by an accidental rencontre with one of the most amiable women I ever beheld.
r

I landed at Dover after a rough, stormy passage, Which made me wish to rest myself a little ere I proceeded to London. While I waited for my chaise I took a turn round the Cliff, as it was a very fine clear day, having a strong fancy to review a place so strongly described by our
inimitable,

inimitable, immortal shakespeare. When I came within sight of it, I had, most luckily, an opportunity to rescue two ladies from the rude attacks of a fellow who, by his dress, appeared to be an officer, but who discovered nothing of the gentleman in his behaviour. — He had just quitted one of the young ladies, and had Seized the other, the Sweetest
creature imaginable, who made violent efforts to disengage herself, assisted by an
*
elderly lady — her mother — as I was afterwards informed. — In a short time I made the insolent wretch, who had presumed to injure a woman So uncommonly beautiful, decamp, and received the thanks both of the mother and the daughter for my generous, and effectual interposition. — The acknowledgments of the latter were conveyed to me in the Softest accents I ever heard. -- Charmed
E 6 with

with having been of any Service to hers, I entreated her and the other ladies to let me attend them to the place to which they were going. They returned me thanks; and the elderly lady added— —

I then attended them to the inn, where, in consequence of the very favourable mention made of me, I was received with the greatest politeness by Mr. and Mrs. Sympfon, who invited me to their house at Canterbury — “that we may thank you in a better manner’* - — Said the old gentleman.
You may. be Sure, Stanly, that I did not want any pressing; you may be Sure that I was ready enough to comply with an invitation So agreeable to my taste. — I took care, also, that they might not have any reason to repent of their civilities, to let them know to whom they thought themselves obliged, and had the Supreme Satisfaction to find, that the respect was paid to me alone, as it was not in the least increased after the discovery

In short, Stanly, she appears to me to have every qualification neceltary to render the marriage state happy. — However, the idle notion of yours which you have been continually beating into my head, with regard to the chastity of the woman who has never been tried, makes me fearful of putting the important question: and yet, I Swear it will be cruel to try this angelic creature; she looks sh innocently lovely: she is not Such a high-spirited girl as your Clara, who will, I hope, lead you

I Wonder what you can have heard, Clara, and by what means. I don’t know that I have anything particular to tell you, except our going to make the long intended visit to Mr. sympson at Canterbury, of which I had but just time to inform you.
During our stay at Canterbury, Mr. Sympfon would carry us to See D over castle, Pier, cc. chut, within a quarter of a mile of Dover, Mr. Sympfon was Seized with the gout in his stomach.
 .
mach, and obliged to stop at the nearest public house. After having taken Something which Soon relieved him a little, he enlisted upon my mother’s going with me and miss sympson to See the, pier. — We complied, yet with reluctance, and were followed by a very impertinent fellow, dressed like an officer. He first attacked me; I had the good fortune to disengage myself from him: he then caught hold of my friend : after having rudely kissed her, he a Second time Seized me. While I was struggling with him, a gentleman stew to my assistance. On his Swift approach the other made off, and my deliverer desired leave to wait on us all to the place we were going to. — Mr. Sympfon not only received him at our return with great civility, but invited him to Canterbury; and was not less pleased to find that 4

young rpan of quality had, in this licentious age, discovered So much readiness to defend insulted decency. Lord Beauford accepted of Mr. sympfon’s invitation, Ipent two days with us, gave general Satisfaction, and then left us to go to his uncle at Hayes. And this is the whole affair. Now, I suppose, if you
had met with this man, you would have
#
made a demi god of him; that is, in a letter to me. I am very well acquainted with your lively imagination, Clara; I know how apt you are to magnify everything that comes in your way. — I will own, indeed, that Lord Beaiiford is handsome; he is allb agreeable: I Say also;; though you Set a high value on beauty in man or woman, I have fallen in with many beautiful figures of both Sexes, who were the most disagree able companions in the world. — When

I hope there are; I am certain there are; because his Lordship is not at all vain or assuming; and he, undoubtedly, would have been so, had he been the only charming man in the world. Every gentleman will interpose when a woman is improperly attacked. There was nothing, therefore.

IT was, indeed, a simple adventure, my dear. — I repeat yourwords: — but it will, in my opinion, if you do not carry your prudery top far, be attended with great consequences : yes, Sophy; if you play your cards with judgement, you may be Lady Beauford. The man would not have staid at Canterbury two days — (especially when he was in Such a hurry to vistt his uncle — and with 'your Mr. sympson, who, however excellent he may be in your eyes, can never
be

be a Suitable companion to a young fellow of fashion —) had he not taken a
fancy to you, or to your young friend,
♦
Now perhaps Jhe is the person who has had So considerable an influence over him. I cannot yet positively declare concerning his favourite, till I hear farther : but I am very Sure, that if you have not made an impression upon his heart, he has conquered yours. I know, child, how much your little heart beats for him, by the prodigious pains you take to conceal your tender emotions: and you have thoroughly convinced me,
by your manner of Ipeaking about my
«
Lord, and the Dover affair, that he is both handsome and amiable; and that it is pride only which hinders you from confessing your love. You do not care to own your feelings in favour of Lord Beauford, till he has avowed his for you.
You

You are right : but though you need not publish them to the world, you may Safely communicate them to me, who conceal nothing from you; who am ready to tell you even my faults: you ought not indeed to keep any Secrets from me. — Speak out, therefore, Sophy: and yet, if I should be mistaken, I shall blame myself extremely, for having given you false hopes, which may hurt your peace. You have a gentle affectionate mind; and if you do not meet with a Suitable companion, you cannot be happy.
I mentioned Beauford to Stanly, with

“Vfith one of your temper, I see plainly. Madam, ” answered he in a heat.

“I mujl believe you, Clara, though you should contradict yourself directly. ^ I am the man : my very being depends upon your favourable opinion of me. Have you not long been Sensible.. my love for you? — And yet, you charming trifler, how artfully have you avoided giving ease to my fond heart!”
I blushed;

strove to recover myself; but I was in Such a stutter of Spirits, that I could not Speak : and he increased my embarrassment, by holding both my hands fast in his, and fixing his eyes on my face. — I was Silent, partly from pleasure — shall I own it? — as well as from confusion— — ■
See I am no prude, my dear — I will honestly confess that I love Stanly; and that I shad, for sometime, Secretly sighed for this declaration. — Where is the woman whose heart is dif cngaged, and who is acquainted with his power of pleasing, can feel sheishelf indifferent to him?

I may wish you did, however, ” answered he, while doubt and fear were So blended in his face, as to make Iiim appear in my eyes more pleasing than ever. Then, after a pause, during which he was So attentive to my motions, that I dared not to look up — “Tell me, ” added he, still pressing my hands, “tell me, Clara, are you angry ?”

I Have played the fool. I have enabled Clara to see that I love her: nay I have plainly told her So; I Suppose, indeed, Ihe knew'' the situation of my heart before, but I did not intend to make her formally acquainted with it. Yet it is impossible to be always upon one’s guard. The artful little gipsy, whether accidentally, or on purpose, I cannot say, made me jealous of you, and so drew everything out of me. You stare at this assertion, and are, perhaps, ^ ready

ready to affirm positively that you never

Saw her. It may be So: but I suppose your favourite Miss Evelyn— — is, t believe, clara’s intimate friend — has been prating about you. these girls, Harry, cannot let us alone: and So my
t
gentlewoman thought that, by mention ing you. She might have no bad opportunity to Sift everything she wanted out of me, her stratagem proved successful. I was too much in love with her to see thro’ her Scheme, and fairly laid open my, heart, to her.. On Second thoughts, however, I do not repent of my frankness neither, for she discovered So much unfeigned joy at the confession of my pass fion for her, that it almost deprived her of the power of utterance. — How deli cioussy did her enchantingshofom heave f And when I pressed her balmy lips to mine, I felt her heart flutter as if it

would have flown into my bosom: yet She modestly corrected me for my freedom; but if she was not actually transported at it, I will give up all my knowledge of women. — There was so charming a bashfulness in her Sweet down cast eyes which now and then glanced at me, that my love was almost raised to adoration. Her voice too was So Softened whenever she Spoke to me, and ssie drew her hand from mine with Such reluctance when she apprehended the appearance of anybody to interrupt us — she certainly loves me, Beauford, at present, and sincerely; I believe I may add, fondly: but I must try her: besides, she is naturally volatile; consequently what she likes today, may be her aversion tomorrow— — bare idea of that fickleness makes me tremble. I am far gone indeed: I
never loved truly till now; yet I must
not

not — however I punish myself— — must not let her see her power over me. — In the mean time let me know if I can be of any service to you. I will make as many inquiries about Miss Evelyn for you, as you chuse to Send me; Clara, I know, correlponds with her. As we happen to prefer these two friends we may, I think, be Serviceable to each other: but don’t betray me, Harry; — if you do, by all that’s goodbye our long friendship, I not only give you up for ever, but will hazard my life in Sacrificing you to my resentment.

As to miss Evelyn, I should be happy in finding her the woman every way to my wish; but as it will be a difficult matter for me to become Sufficiently intimate with her, if I do not make a proposal in form, and as Such a proposal might open the door to a great deal of hypocrisy, you may, if you please, endeavour to find out every real thought of her heart;, every particular relating to her character and dssposition, by properly questioning your Clara, who will,. I doubt, from what you have communicated, be too Severely tried.. She appears, from your description,, to be quite an amiable girl; amiable hi herself, and. really partial to you. Do not play the rogue, therefore, Stanly, but stop in, time; know when you are well: deserve the heart of one woman of worth at least;
tho’ you are not entitled to the affections
of

of a woman of merit after the havoc you have made among the Sex. J, who have had far more consideration for them, expect better treatment from them.

“Perfectly So, if you will treat me with less Severity, ” replied I, throwing my arm round her waist, and stghing for akiss which I, actually, dared hot sto take. So fearful was I of offending her. Could she be offended? you will Say, perhaps.
Why she might not really have been offended, but she might have thought it. Prudent to appear, offended; and indeed she will always appear So when I proceed to Such liberties if she is the woman I take her to be: and yet, tho’ I wish to find her chaste, I shudder at the idea of

more liberties than I approved of; I checked him, and he left me abruptly: I could have born his abrupt departure, tho’ I scarcely closed my eyes all night after it; but when he absented himself a whole week, I felt how necessary his prelence was to my peace. I cannot tell you how peevish, how fretful I was with every creature about me. Mrs. Morden, and my Sukey, both wondered what ailed me; yet I kept my unea finesses to myself, and pleaded illness: by So doing I alarmed my dear good aunt, and I hated myself for giving her pain — I continued extremely restless, and finding that he still kept away, hurried from one place to another in hopes of meeting him. At last I saw him at Ranelagh flirting with a very pretty girl. I could hardly bear it, Sophy. I strove
to hide my feelings, but my efforts were

in vain. My companions perceived an instantaneous alteration in me; and all my acquaintance Surrounded me to inquire into the cause of it.
Stanly, at length, came up, and with a coolness Sufficient to freeze me to
ft
death, tho’ the room was as hot as a furnace, bowing carelessly at the same time. Said, “Your most obedient, ma flam. Are you not well ?”
I made him no answer: I was too much chagrined to make any reply; but tho’ I did not utter a Syllable, it was neither pride nor resentment which tied my tongue: for I am Sure my looks discovered, in a great measure, what pasted in my heart.
He then turned off; yet Soon afterwards, when I was only with Mrs.

Mrs. Mears is, you know, a woman of the world; Jhe, therefore, took nc notice of his manner of proceeding, but, as I came with her, followed us. He placed himself by me in her coach, and held my hand, unobserved— — thought

I told you, from the first, that it would be a very nice point to keep Such a man to myself: I had endured So much, indeed, from his indifference, that I dreaded another quarrel before we were hardly reconciled. You would chide me, Sophy, if you knew all; and yet when you reflect upon the declaration which you have

Sure of it. I told you in my last, that I left her with an affected anger. I kept away almost a week. — We met at Ranelagh: the dear girl looked pale and dispirited; everybody crowded about her to ash her how she did. I coolly paid her the same compliment. She lifted up her lovely eyes, opprested with the most charming languor, but Seemed unable to Speak. I felt I had been unkind to her,

I got her out and went home with her. She discovered her transports upon the occasion partly by her blushes, partly by her silence, and partly by ashing me to Sup with her. Luckily, Mrs. Morden, her aunt, was Safe in her chamber for the evening. We did not eat much. Clara was too full of joy, and I was too attentive to her; however, I contrived to ravish a

capable of giving her a moment’s dis quiet. The man who loves a woman only for himself, and who pays no regard to the Sentiments of his mistress, cannot be worthy of her. — Clara wroughton’s Sentiments, with regard to female how

nour, may perhaps give me a good deal of trouble; but as her feelings are evidently in my favour, I shall be able, I
fancy, to lead her to everything I wish. — I See plainly that I am in full possteshon of her heart. — Can a woman, always, when she has made a present of her heart, refule to throw her person into the bargain?

I do not, however, pretend to weaken your assertions, nor to deny the neceshty of paying a proper regard to them; but I hope you will, in your turn, allow, that a woman may be chaste without being a prude.

A disagreeable woman gains no honour by the mere preservation of her virtue; the men will always tell you, that she cannot but be chaste, who has never been tried. And catnyou, my Sophy, with all your affected indifference about yon, would be Sorry to have no man think you worthy’of a trial. Let us not, then, carry our discretion to an extravagant pitch: there is no occshon to be out rageoussy virtuous, as I once heard a lady Say to her companion who was inveighing, with great energy, against a poor girl who had been too condescending to her lover; and we do not know" how we might have behaved in her fitu ation. ^i am very willing to own, that I

He Seems to have singled me out; and as I always foresaw that it would be a difh cult matter to make So enchantine; a felo

low constant, I am taking all the pains in my power to fix his wavering heart: when I have^need it, I stiall not be obliged to humour him quite so much as I do at present; if he does not encroach upon my shdulgence, I shall receive infinite pleasure by pleasing him. I really believe, Sophy, that he loves me sincerely; and I am inexpressibly delighted to discover new proofs of his attachment to me every day. Shall I then, by a behaviour ridiculoussy prudish, venture to run a

You tell me nothing of Lord Beauford — Stanly has plied me with questions about you, at the particular desire of his friend, I suppose; but I have been discreet, Sophy, on your account, tho’ you have often told me that I should never be So on my own.

She is no longer the kind, consent ing, yielding fair. She keeps up a distant, cool politeness with me, which is, by no means, to my humour, I love a Sprightly girl; but she must neither be shy, nor Scornful. — I cannot, indeed. Say that Clara is Scornful, but she coys it strangely; and yet she Smiles at times, and her eyes contradict her words.

alone. If I leave her for a week or ten days, as I did before, Ihe will come to I Suppose: but I cannot bring myself to stay So long again from the woman of rny heart. Let her behave how she pleases she will ever be mistress of my affections. This strange alteration in her behaviour to me arises, it Seems, from the irregii larity of my proceedings: I should have talked of matrimony, and Settlements, and equipages, and jewels. Sec. See. See. of which, I confess, I never once thought — and So, perhaps I have lost her: had I been received as a lover in form, all reasonable liberties would have been undoubtedly allowed me: and I should have had numberless opportunities to Seize others. I might, in short, have been completely happy by this time had I played my cards in a masterly manner. — And now I shall enter upon my aftergame

game So awkwardly — I must not, however, lose her. — There is madness in the idea. — I have not staid away, though She has been So discouraging. — To bring her back into the old style, I have behaved with a coolness which I never felt. — It is imposhble to be indifferent about her. She has beauty to create desire, and a thousand nameless graces in her carriage to increase it. — With all her allurements, indeed, she is, at the Same time. So be witchingly modest, that I despair of prevailing on her to yield to my earnest entreaties : and I should hate myself, were I capable of making use of any of those detestable arts which have been so often, and so Successfully tried: Such arts are beneath contempt. No, the woman whom I love must be mine from inclination — she must be free as air: she must
act without the least restraint. Her love
for

her : I wish to see her as impassioned as myself, if she could discover her passion with a proper degree of delicacy. — Such a woman is, I firmly believe, Clara Wroughton.' — But I cannot, how flattering Soever my discoveries may be, marry her. She will, however, have this advantage, over my other women — I shall ever feel for her a Superior tenderness. I really think the girl is naturally chaste : but will the woman, who feels a strong propensity to please the man whom she loves, always feel the same propensity to please him and no body else.? — The woman who loves with that kind of ardour which can, alone, Satisfy me, is but ill provided against strong Solicitations. I hate your lukewarm mistresses, who either Seem to be half asseep in your arms, or are studying how to decorate their persons, or to
draw

draw fresh Sums out of your pocket. Such mercenary devils I heartily defpise.
I would Sooner perish than touch a woman who did not love me for myself— — I am Sure of Clara: her fortune in her own hands lets her above avaritious motives. — If she has strength to resist me — as I am Sure of her love — by all that’s Sacred, I will marry her — ay — -

I cannot imagine what Satisfaction you will derive from your mode of finejfing: you may, perhaps, by your over cunning, render an amiable woman extremely unhappy, and fix your vile prejudices against the whole Sex too deeply to be ever eradicated.

WELL, Sophy! I have brought
him to my purpose: and as I have gained my point by following your advice, you are entitled to the merit arising from my behaviour. I had, though not without pain, determined to keep up my consequence; that is, to keep at a greater distance from him than usual.

He, in revenge, was cool and indifferent. Had I been Sure his indifference

taken a Single step to lure him back again; but he deceived me So dexte roussy, that I never suspected him. Yet I Suffered him to flirt with Nancy Garlies, till I actually, indeed, began to fear he meant to be Serious; and then I could bear it no longer. I grew more and more reserved, aiid had once resolved to make him jealous in my turn; however, I thought I would try first what I could do with Such a proceeding.' To my great Satisfaction, he became weary of acting his part. Following me, one day, into the back parlour, into which I went to fetch my tambour, he ashed me, what I meant by treating him with So much neglect.
This question gave me Spirits : I replied, “My behaviour is, I think, very Suitable to yours.”

“You cannot accuse me of neglecting you, *’ Said he, eagerly, “till you drove me from you by your forbidding reserve. I was not permitted to behate like a lover : a prudish coyness, a downright coldness, was all the return I got to my tenderest protestations.”
“There was So little meaning in those protestations. Sir Edward, ” replied I, “that you ought not to wonder at my paying little regard to them.” “By H -- -- -- -- -- n, ” Said he, “I was Sincere.
I love you, dote on you with

the utmost ardour.”

“When you give me proofs of the Sincerity of your professions, I shall then know how to answer you.”

Catching me in his arms at the Same time, he kissed me So eagerly, before I could hinder him, that I had Scarce

“And why So much resentment, my dear Clara ?” cried he, with the most instnuating accents imaginable; and again taking my hand — “I do not understand you: how are you circumstanced So, as to exclude me from the enjoyment of those transporting liberties which are allowed, other happy lovers?

“I did not know we were lovers till this minute, ” Said I, with all the vivacity I could muster up.
“Not know we were lovers! Did you then encourage me only as a dangler, Madam? I vas not, I consess, aware of your intentions, or I should not have So readily appeared in a light So little to my honour, or my humour.” ‘‘ I am as little inclined to encourage danglers, Sir, as any woman can possibly be, or as you yourself can be to become one; but men, who are perpetually following women without appearing in their proper characters, must be liable to imputations not agreeable to them.” “And pray. Madam, what character do you allow to be a proper one for a man to Secure his admittance to a Lady ?”
I own,
ft
♦
 . 153
I own, Sophy, I was So confused, to think of the dilemma into which I had brought myself, by this conversation, that I Scarce knew vrhat reply to make. — To have declared my opinion, would have been to ash him to marry me : and yet, what could I Say; as he would not understand me without a declaration of it? I coloured, and turned away my face, to hide it; being conscious of looking like a Simpleton : yet I remembered what you liad Said; and thought, at the Same time, that it was better to look like a fool, than to be duped. I told him, therefore, that I was Sorry to See a man So much in the world at a loss to know how to conduct himself; adding, that a man of real honour always knew how to behave to a woman of character; as he' could not but be Sensible
H 5 that
ft

154  .
that his own reputation would be injured by his indiscretion, as well as hers.
He appeared rather disconcerted, Sophy, at this answer, though he has a monstrous assurance. For my part, tho’
I wished to have him understand me, I
\
was So fearful of goihg too far, that I felt myself exceshvely embarrassed. — The Sweet fellow, then, feeing my di stress, came up to me, took me by the ' hand, and, with a respectful tenderness,
• Said, “Forgive me, Clara, if I have not Spoken as fully as I ought, not fully enough, at least, for you to understand me. — But how could you mis understand me? Could you Suppose I should follow you with any other design than to unite myself to you for ever by the most binding of all ties? Could you possibly imagine, that I meant to trifle with you? I
thought
/
d

ft
 : 155
thought you had a more favourable opinion of me.”
While he uttered the few last words, he looked a thousand inexpressible things, and his voice was So Softened, So bewitching,, that. I blamed myself for having distrusted him: I could not any longer refuse him the kiss he most earnestly Solicited, to convince him that I was thoroughly reconciled. We then returned to the company.
Now, my dear, I think I may venture to Say I have hopes of him. I am, by no means, certain of Securing him, indeed; but, by what I have heard, he has never dangled (as he calls it) after any woman so much as he has after me, without being more intimately connected with her: I have also been told, that not one of his temporary favourites could keep him long Iblely attached to her. I
H 6 have
ft
f
156  .
have no very inviting prospect, you will Say: and yet I cannot reject him. — I
would not for an immense Sum have him
/
know how dear he is to my foolishly fond heart: and how still more amiable he has rendered himself to me by his ecld.acijfement. He must be Serious; he must mean fairly : — at least, I cannot help believing him Serious and Sincere. — It is impossible for me to tell you all the obliging things he Said and did, after our return to the company in the evening— — never thought him So handsome, So very agreeable, before. — Perhaps you will say, I never haei So much reason: and, indeed, I am of that opinion.
And now, Sophy, let me ash yon, if you have heard nothing of my Lord. Beverly has deserted us and the town. Nancy Garlies and he have had a falling out, I fancy. She has Said nothing.
to

to me yet; but she coloured vastly when I mentioned him : So that there has certainly been either a great deal of love, or a great deal of anger, between them. I shall take an opportunity to question her about it when I find her alone. I 'did not, I confess, much like the great attention which fiie paid to Stanly; but when Such a charming fellow talks, where is the woman who will not listen, especially if he admires her? — Stanly admires Nancy, undoubtedly, for She is very handsome : but had she been an absolute Medusa, he would have flirted with her, only to alarm me. Never let the fellows complain of us they can outdo us, at at any time, in flirting.

Miss EVELYN.
I Have been almost: on the brink of another quarrel with Stanly. — Would you
believe it? neither Lady Jane Selby, nor Mrs. Mears, could, among their numerous acquaintance, get a ticket for the malked ball; and they were, both. So much ashamed to discover the small ness of their interest with the men, that when they informed me they could not go with me, it was folate I could not tell how to procure a companion. Stan
lib
164  .
ly, availing himself of my disappointment, told me that he could not, possibly, furnish me with another ticket.
“I cannot go then, ” Said I.
He looked out of humour, and ashed me, if I was afraid to trust myself with him.
“Not at all, ” replied I; “but you cannot expect me to go vrith you alone.”
I
“And why not? Can you be guilty of' any impropriety by going with the man to whom you are to be married ?”
“When I am married to you, ” Said I, “there will not, indeed, be the least impropriety in my going with you to a
ft
masquerade without company; but even then the world would condemn Such a step, and perhaps laugh at us also.”
“D -- -- -- n the world — muttered
he, between his teeth. — “And do
you
 . 165
you intend, ” added he aloud, “to govern yourself by the world ?”
‘‘ I cannot absolutely Say So in every respect; but I would not choose to make myself ridiculoiis, when I may, by staying from a masked ball, escape a great deal of raillery.”
^ ft
“Your staying away for So foolish a reason, will be ridiculous indeed, in my opinion; but you must do as you please, Madam : only, if you do not make use of your ticket, I shall be glad to give it to another Lady as beautiful as yourself. Though you do not choose to accompany me, there are women enough who will.”
This Speech piqued me, Sophy, I confess: I was extremely mortified by it: I would have given up all the mask
I
ed balls in the vrorld with pleasure: but I could not bear to think of another woman’s
\
H
166  ,
man’s going with him. I turned away; tears were ready to start from my eyes — as foolishly weak as my heart: however, I strove to conceal them, pretending to have So violent a cold, that it would be much more prudent for me to stay at home — though I longed, you may imagine, to make my a, ppearance at the masquerade.
“You can determine, I suppose, Madam, in a couple of hours, whether you will favour me with your company, or not ?”
With those words, followed by a cool bow, he left me.
To my shame be it mentioned, I Sat down and cried for an hour, without being able to come to any resolution about my behaviour to Sir Edward— — I
was in a state of the utmost uncertainty, Nancy Garlies came; but, luckily, finding
 . 167
ing my aunt in the parlour, fiie did not run up to me, as usual. She staid with her till I was informed she was below. 1 had, therefore, time enough to recover myself.
She came up to me Soon afterwards. — - “I want to consult you, my dear, ” Said she, “about a dress for the fub fcription ball, as Lady Coleman is to take me with her and miss Coleman.”
I jumped at this intelligence; and alked her if their party was quite full; adding — “I have only a Single ticket, and none of my friends happen to be going but those with whom I do not choose to mix.”
“I am Sure, ” Said Nancy, that Lady Coleman will be glad of your company.”
Accordingly, I appointed them to call on me.
While
ft
i68  .
%
While we were Settling these important points, a mighty cool and concise note came from Stanly, to know my determination.
I answered it with equal coolness, and equal conciseness; only mentioning my party. — I then began to question my little blushing Nancy about Beverly; and she discovered a Scene that pasted between them, which occasioned his departure from London, lest his disgrace— — he has the assurance to call it — should become the talk of the town. — The cafe is this: He had made love to Nancy for Some time, in his Saucy manner, and attempted to take liber
^
ties after liberties. One evening, when he knew that Mrs. Serle was engaged to go out by herself, he appeared, .and sat three whole hours with her. — During that time he behaved with an insolence
which
/
4
 . 169
which shocked her prodigioufiy : she rang, she called, she knocked. — Not a
creature came to her affistancc; as he had fastened the door. At last, however, she found an opportunity to open the windovr, and to cry out for help.
A gentleman passing by, at that instant, flew to her relief, and made Beverly look So ridiculous, that he could not
stand it: and So he is gone down to his uncle’s in Kent, till Something new draws off the attention of the town from him.
Nancy told her tale very prettily, and, according to her own account, conducted herself very discreetly; yet I could not help finiling at her Simplicity.
“Beverly, ” Said I to her, “must
#
certainly think you have no difiike to his
proceedings, my dear, as you Suffered him So quietly to fasten the, door.”
vol. L I “Indeed,
I

“Indeed, miss Wroughton, ” replied she, “I knew nothing of the matter.
I never once imagined that any gentleman could have behaved So : but I shall be more upon my guard for the future, and will never she alone with a man again.”

that he might do what he pleased with

“I cannot tell who he is, ” replied Ihe; “but he is young, and very
handsome : Beverly called him My Lord.”

From the same to the Same.
P
WELL, Sophy: all goes right,
tho’ I soresee that I stiall find it a
difficult bufiness to keep Sir Edward in order. I always told you Sa However,
I do not despair. I have as much Spirit as he has, and we shall See who will get the better. — Now for the masked ball.
I chose a dress from a drawing I had Seen of a beautiful Greek stave, and was taken up by Lady Coleman in the character of a Roman matron. miss Coles

man appeared like a nosegay girl, and the blushing Nancy like a demure Quaker. — I Soon discovered Stanly in a yellow domino, with a black hat and fear
3 there:
174  .
there: he was unmafl<ed, and feeined to
f
take great pains to examine the faces of all the elegant figures in the room. At length, he came tip to our group, bargained for a nosegay with miss Coleman, and thee and thotfd a little with Nancy, (telling her, however, Ihe was not moved by a proper Spirit.) He Seemed rather shy of my lady; and then, accosted me with a freedom which Somewhat disconcerted me in So public a place. After having Surveyed me, apparently, with great Satisfaction, he threw his arm round my waist, and cried, in a gay tone, “What is your purchase, my lovely girl? name your price, and it shall be paid you instantly.”
“Thankee, Sir, ” replied I, curtsying, “but I am above all price; and tho’ I
.ft
have not had time to accommodate myself to the English fashions, I breathe
the
/
 . '175
the Spirit of English liberty as freely as ^ I breathe the British air.”
‘‘ Excellent!” replied he, claspingme still closer: “You are quite after my own heart. I admire liberty in every shape, but in a female form like thine, I adore it.”
“I am afraid we mistake each other’s principles, ” Said I, endeavouring to disengage myself, “for you appear very fond of confining me against my will:
and I am determined to maintain my freedom against all encroachers.”
“But if you should happen to like me as well as I like you, I hope you will phen deliver yourself up to me at once, without any ties or restraints whatever.”
“You hope to no purpose, Sir: for your conditions are not in the least agree
ft
able to me; I desire you, therefore, to
I 4 leave
%
ft
176  .
leave me, that I may chuse a man more Suitable to my taste.”
He looked piqued at my reply, though I am pretty Sure he did not know me at that time; but as he was himself unmashed, his vanity, I suppose was hurt by the Small attention I paid to his person: he would have had me, no doubt, ‘prodigioussy struck with it. — “It is not customary for the women in your country, ” Said he, “to refuse any men, whether they like them or not, unless they have any particular views.”
“Perhaps you may be right, but I have, since I left my native land, accommodated myself entirely to the manners of the Englishwomen, who are free in the mostextensive sense of the word: they chuse and reject, agreeably to their inclinations, and are even as little ceremonious
 . 177
ous with their husbands as they are with their lovers.”
“Why yes, ” replied he, “our English women are indeed, as well as our English mobs, so devoted to liberty in every shape, that we shall be obliged, for the Safety of the constitution, to make Some considerable regulations among the former and the latter, and to lay them both under Salutary restrictions. — You could not, therefore, have arrived here at a worse time.”
“As no restrictions of any consequence are yet in force, ” Said I, laughing, “I shall not trouble myself about future proceedings of that tyrannical kind: I shall make so good use of my time, as to be wholly indifferent about them.”
“Bravo!” cried he. Seizing my hands.
— ^‘now you are a girl completely to

my taste: no British female ever breathed mofe liberal Sentiments.
“Ay — but not too fast. — I told you before that you was not the man of my choice.”
ft
“What fault can you find in me ?” replied he, horridly disappointed.
You are too volatile, too inconstant, too violent for me.”
“How can I poshbly be So, as you have declared your aversion to restraints of every kind? — Variety, therefore, must be full as agreeable to you, as it is to me.
‘‘ Yes, Sir, but tho’ I must be entirely at liberty myself to rove wherever I please, I would have the man whom I love faithful to me alone.”
ft
“Right woman! — Really, Madam, I begin to think I have been in a capital error ail this while: I begin to think
that
  ERAILTY. 179
that you was neither born nor educated in a land of Slavery; you are certainly, every way, a British woman, and perfectly disposed to act without any shack r les upon your fancy, when the proper object falls into your power, — Since then I have been So grossly mistaken, I mufb look out for a woman with principles not quite So fashionable.”
Every man to his taste. Sir, ” replied I, laughing. “I am also going in Search of constancy: but I am afraid I shall never find it — ina man. When I have found a constant man, I will take care to keep him sh, ”
“The talk will not be a very easy one, ” Said he.
Can you tell me in what maimer to proceed. Sir, in order to carry my point ?” “No, really. Madam; as I never intend to be a tame animal chained to a
I 6 ghd’s
f
io  .
girl’s fide, like her Squirrel, I have not studied the character.”
“Here then we break off, my fine, sickle. Sir Edward Stanly, ” cried I.
You know me then, ” replied he, and by all that’s good,.! will not leave you till I have found you out. So fine a form, and So much entertaining vivacity I never yet met with but in one woman: the sight of a Single feature in your face would Satisfy me in a moment.” — (Going to lift up my malk.)
“Hold, Sir; I am not that happy woman, yet I choose to engage you, to keep you from finding her out.”
‘‘ Let me then see your face, that I may know if you are as handsome as. Ihe is.”
“No — no — I shall not unmask indeed for as my face is not at all related to my
tongue.
 . ii
tongue, we shall only be, both of us,
disappointed.”
“I am Sorry you are So ugly, ” cried he, “but as I have loved a number of women for their beauty alone, you must permit me to love you for your wit: you may, therefore, unmask as Soon as you please. I shall not be frightened.”
“No — but / by showing a face so different from that which you expect.”
Just at that instant, when he began to be really clamorous about my un massdng, Fanny .Dattle came flying to me, with her mask in her hand. — “My dear Miss Wroughton, ” cried she, “what a Sweet fancy you have! But do let us See you as yourself; everybody
begins to unmaflc.”

Your dress is very becoming, I will allow; but you want not the assistance of dress to render yourself more alluring.”
I Smiled, and told him, that I should be quite contented, if I was mistress of the heart which I preferred to every other,
“Is that mine?” Said he. Softly — press fing my hand, and looking at me with a tenderness which charmed me. — However, thinking I was too particular in a public place, I replied — “I will answer. that question another time.” But he was so excessively agreeable, that I am afraid,

It is an arduous talk, Sophy, to behave Severely to the man we love.
I had almost forgot to tell you that a very handsome, and genteel man joined miss Garlies, talked with her, and danced with her. — Stanly presented him to me as Lord Beauford, the very man who was your champion at Dover. — We have, both, discovered that he rescued her from Beverley : he is absolutely a knight errant, my dear. — You have not played your cards well, Sophy: for if I See clearly, Nancy stands the fairest chance to be My Lady.

Sir EDWARD STANLY
I Called at your house today, but you was — where, I am told you Spend the greatest; part of your time — at Mrs. morden’s. I wanted to talk with you about our women. — miss Wroughton is a fine, lively girl: had she not been your choice first, she, certainly, would have been mine. — Yet I am not violently struck with her beauty, or her wit; it is her sensibility, So strongly expressed in her countenance, in her every feature, in every look, in every gesture which
charms
I
 . 185
charms me. Take care, Stanly; if you lose Nr you will never get suck another woman. She loves you, exceedingly: do not be a rogue now, and tempt her too far. As for myself, when I first saw Miss Evelyn I admired her person, and
r
the propriety of her behaviour; but the notion you had put into my head about the necelfity of making a previous trial, made me apprehend that I should not easily find an opportunity favourable to my design— — I was waiting for that opportunity, chance threw me in the way of Miss Garlies, who has, I think, fufiiciently proved her virtue by the terror she discovered at beverly’s impertinence. — He meant no harm, I believe: he was only in a romping humour; however, a fine young creature so alarmed
at the freedoms of so handsome, and in
#
a fellow, gives very strong
proofs
*
t
i8 frailtf;
#
proofs of her modesty and discretion: and I am indeed very ready to believe that Miss Garlies would riot suffer any man to take improper liberties with her.
1 heartily subscribe to the following lines.
“May I ne’er hope where I ne’er deny’d,
“Nor gain a woman willing to be try’d.”
Such a woman Miss Garlies appears to be, and I intend to cultivate an acquaintance with her. Time will Show the event. She is the friend of your Clara. — They are, both, charming women, but their dilpolitions are widely different. — I will allow, indeed, that the difference between them may have been occasioned by their different spheres in life, and • their different educations. Miss Wroughton was, early, introduced into the gay world, with which Ihe seems intimately acquainted, and thoroughly
fatished.
 . 187
satisfied. miss Garlies, tho’ brought up in a retired way, and thrown at once into pleasurable Scenes, is neither astonished nor intoxicated: She Seems rather to be fearful of trusting herself among a number of giddy people who, really, I believe, more from want of reflection, than from a thirst for pleasure, throw themselves into imprudent situations— — do not, Stanly, in my opinion, entertain right ideas about pleasure; if we did, we Should not so frequently, I imagine amiss where we expected to find it. By hurrying precipitately to every place which promises joy, we are perpetually disappointed: nay, we too often involve ourselves in difficulties which we cannot surmount, without combating with ad
4
ditional ones.
You will possibly smile at this serious
letter, after So brilliant an evening at a
✓
masked
i88  .
inallced ball; but when you consider that I have accustomed myself to moralise upon every subject, my grave reflections will not appear, perhaps, either unfound or unseasonable. I wish you could derive the same advantages from philosophy as I do, Stanly: a little felf examination now and then, and close thinking would be of infinite service to you. — By properly you would take the best
step towards fettling your head, which is, I suppose, out of order, in consequence of your last night’s, or rather this morm ing’s expedition.
I am.

YOU are a downright musty mora lizer, Harry; but cannot with all your wifefaws, make me wish not to have enjoyed last night in the manner I did. Let those who have no taste for pleasure, or who have outlived their taste' for pleasure, rail at it. — I am determined to take my swing, while my fenishs are not impaired, and I am sure they were deliciously feasted last night; nay, I have the additional satisfaction to believe, that

Clara was, indeed, enchanting: I do not wonder, therefore, at your speaking of her in fucli exalted terms. — I am transported at your telling me that she loves me. — I think, I own, that I am sure of her affection. What rapturous fensations do I not feel, at this moment, on her account! No body but a man intoxicated with love, as I am, can feel such Sensations. Was she not divinely handsome last night? What taste was displayed in her dress!! elegant were all her motions I what fire, yet what languor was there in her charming eyes! what vivacity! but how was that vivacity tempered with the most enchanting softness!! attempt to talk rea son to a man so much enamoured as I am.

Clara seemed to be afraid of me last night, I thought, for the first time; yet we were not by ourselves: : as the company crowded round us, engaged in their respective pursuits, I had a thousand opportunities to Seize favours unobserved, wdiich were granted with a faint reluctance that enhanced the value of them. There was a winning bashful ness in her looks, a glowing confusion in her face, which I never remarked before, that added innumerable charms to her person and conversation. I am fixed, unalterably hers; that is, in someway or other: and' I am determined to push my fortune now; for Ihe seems to be in a yielding mood. There is no time to lose.

I can, myself, name you two or three very honest fellows who were taken in by such hypocrites. Therefore keep a good lookout. Nancy appears to be a prim little gypsy Clara indeed speaks handsomely of her. — Clara, to do her justice, never strives to depreciate the charms of another woman : I admire her candour: she is always ready to allow every beauty herfull share of attraction. — By such a generosity of temper she raises herself in my

Mr. Beverly — don’t start, Clara, is here. His uncle. Sir Thomas Hayter, is our neighbour, and has introduced his nephew to our acquaintance. — Had you been with me, you would have Said that I primmed it; but as the rest of the compaiiy knew nothing of Mr. Beverly, they were wonderfully delighted with him. He behaved himself, indeed, all

things considered, extremely well. I always thought the'man naturally better than you represented him, — It is by making a fuss with the men, that we Ipoil them : were we to let them alone, they would hot, I dare say, give themselves half So much trouble about us. The complaints on both Sides generally arise
from

from our taking too much notice of them, or encouraging them to take too much notice of us. I declare I never saw Beverly conduct: himself half so much.

Everybody listened to him; nobody could be offended with him; all, therefore were satisfied: and I believe I may venture to say, that all were pleased, I am now, more than ever, convinced that a total indifference with regard to men is the only proper mode of behaviour to them. How, indeed, can we treat them in any other manner, without the greatest impropriety?

upon a very pretty family estate. The daughter is a fine girl — 1 have seen her with Clara Wroughton; but as Clara is so continually saying or doing something to take off your attention from every other woman, even from her nearest and dearest friend, I never had an opportunity to converse with Miss Evelyn, who, on her part,
f
indeed, never gave me the stightest encouragement to imagine Ihe was destrous of my entertaining her: but here — the scene is changed. — A few days ago Ihe came with her mother and other ladies to dine at my uncle’s; and appeared so much superior to every woman there, hot only by her personal charms, but by the propriety of her whole carriage, and conversed with such winning ease, which was accompanied with a bewitching modesty, that I
confess I was infinitely struck with her,
and was involuntarily impelled to recommend
 . 201
mend myself to her notice. — In all my approaches to the fair sex, I had never felt such an impulse. There is a cheerfulness in her countenance, and an unaffected delicacy in her manner, sufficient to captivate infenjibility: and then her obedience, and affectionate attentions to her mother, are not to be equalled. — If ever I am to marry, I would not wiffi for a woman with a more desirable person or character; but that very character will make against: me; for ffie conducts herself with such uncommon, yet becoming discretion to all men, and treats everybody
with such an equality of politeness, that I am afraid ffie will never listen to such a wild fellow as I am: though I do
really believe, that if this Sophy could but be brought to accept of me, I ffiould be the better for it as long as I live. My uncle indeed was the first man who put

it into my head, and promised to add ten thousand pounds — immediate payment — totuy fortune — that is — as soon as I can procure Miss evelyn’s consent. If Jfhe has heard — and no doubt Ihe has heard — of the bustle Nancy Garlies has made about me, Ihe will never receive my ad drestes: Ihe has always, indeed, declar. ed, that stie looks upon a spotless reputation to be absolutely neceltary in man as well as woman; and if Ihe is stncere — as I think She is — Ihe will certainly make strict: inquiries about me. — Her friend Clara will give her intelligence enough concerning me, for which I shall be extremely obliged to her, you know. — seri oufly, I am not the culpable fellow I have been represented: I will tell you the wshole affair just as it happenedi looked upon Nancy Garlies, most assuredly, as
a very fine girl; and as Such a girl I was
tempted

Yet there is hardly a girl, though brought up with the greatest Simplicity, who does not make it the principal bustness of her life to look sharp after men. By the general behaviour of the fair sex, we are Sufficiently enabled to See that they are a pack of cheats, and that they spend the greatest part of their tiny in trying to impose upon us: unluckily for us, their impositions are too frequently fuccessfui. — And yet .Miss Evelyn Seems to be So different from other women, that I confess she has staggered me. — My resolutions against matrimony are considerably >ypakened by her very prudent behaviour.

I then caught both her hands, and held them so fall that she could not get away from me — I watched every riling
passion of her soul. At first she returned my glances with equal tenderness; but when I grew more impassioned, She appeared to be overwhelmed with a Soft confusion which would not suffer her to bear either my fensations or her own. — Averting her face. She Said, “Pray let me. go. Sir Edward; I do not deserve the epithets you have given me.”
I told her I could not believe her till file looked at me again.
“There then, ” replied She, turning her face towards me covered with tears, “now let me go.”
“Never, ” said I, straining her to my bosom, and ardently killingher. — “Never.”
She struggled violently to get from
me: then, coming back to me of her own

accord, and laying her pretty white hand on my Ihoulder, looking at me at the same time with a mixture of timidity and tenderness— — “you not angry ?” said fly, with a gentle sigh.
“Angry!” replied I, with a second and still more impassioned embrace, “is
Ik
it possible to be angry with you, thus kind, thus condescending as you are ?■ —
^ No, Clara, be but always kind, and you will always see me transported with you.”
She shook her head, and broke from me, with a Second Sigh, as we heard Somebody upon the flairs, and Sat down towards the farthest end of the room. — There came in a great deal of company, yet she Seemed Serious, absent, and inattentive to everybody but me, and even, to me did not give any direct: answers, though

might seize every moment to speak to her. Could I but contrive any method to be with her alone for two or three hours, I should soon see — But there are no hopes at present. I suppose her aunt, who is a cunning woman in her way, and well versed in settlements, presents, cc. with all the pomp and parade of a iplen did alliance, expects me to come roundly to the point, before Ihe trusts her niecc| much with me in private, as if all sha^ stuff secured a woman’s virtue, or tied ^ man faster to her.
I went next morning to breakfast, and ashed the old lady leave to send to my lawyer, presenting, at the same time to Clara, a fine miniature of me, by Humphreys, fet with brilliants.
The'aunt bridled up, as much as to say, “Ay — this is something like.”

I am still dissatisfied. You will say, I imagine,

Miss WROUGHTON.
I Thank you, Clara, thank you sincerely for your caution, and shall pay due regard to it when I find it necessary; but I lee no occasion for it at present, as Beverly — however I may divert you by
saying
\
\
%
  217
saying so —; is indeed quite ariother sort of a man. — He has not forgot the affair •with Miss Garlies, but I am obliged to
you for reminding me of it. — When a woman is infatuated with a man, Ihe is, to be sure, very apt to overlook his failings, and to think him full of virtues. I do
not look upon Beverly as a perfect: character, yet I have ever paid great deference to my mother’s opinion; and as Ihe has been earnestly solicited by Sir though mas and Lady Hayter to admit their nephew to vistt me, I have entirely submitted to Nr j udgment.
On my ashing her whether Ihe thought that a man, who had taken such unwarrantable liberties with so amiable a girl as miss Garlies, ovight to be received by any womap of character, stie hesttated 3 little, and then replied — “Why, it requires some deliberation, my dear: but

• t
I have been always inclined to believe, that ■when women meet with improper behaviour from men, their own behaviour is
\
rather exceptionable. — The liberties, indeed, given and taken now a days are not to be seriously defended; and there are tew men, I fear, who do not presume too much upon the encouragements they meet with from our sex, and behave as Mr. Beverly has done.
I confess I thought my mother went too far, and therefore began to vindicate Miss Garlies in the bell manner I could. She stopped me short by ashing me, if I could pofilbly defend her sitting alone with Mr. Beverly for two or three hours; with a man who had even desired to be admitted as an honourable lover.
But my dear madam, ” replied I, “he locked the door; how could she, then, get out ?”

“Every woman, Sophy, ” said shy mother, “may escape from a man, if she pleases; and no woman ought to give such encouragement to a man, who has not induced her to think he has honourable intentions. It is generally by the care leflhefs or forwardness of the womens that the men are prompted to take unbecoming freedoms; freedoms which they would never think of, had they never reason to suppose they would be allowed.”
“Surely, Madam, ” replied!, ‘‘you believe that there are very difiblutemen in the world; men so very licentious, that no virtuous woman can be safe with them.”
“A virtuous woman will always keep out of their way, Sophy: I will, however, make all proper inquiries into Mr. beverly’s character, and if I hear nothing * L 2 worfc

worse of him than I have heard of the generality of young men, who, being independent at an early age, are exposed to temptations which sometimes prove irre fiilible, I shall be inclined to receive him, as I have a great regard for Sir Thomas and Lady Hayter, and cannot think that they would recommend a man so nearly related to them, if they imagined he was unworthy of you.”
I made no answer. My mother imputed my silence to my obedience; and Mr. Beverly has since yifited here, but fly
Seldom leaves us by ourselves. I can safely say, I have never once wished her to quit the room when he was with me; and one would imagine, from his respectful behaviour to her, that he thought as I did. 'Fhus you see, my dear, that if anything disagreeable should arise from this affair,
I shall
m
 , 221
I fhals at least have the satisfaction of having conformed to my mother’s will, and of having acted, in every respect, with her concurrence. She, smilingly, told me yesterday, that if I waited for a man who had never seized an advanta^ when it was fairly thrown in his way, 1 riiight never be married as long as I lived. — ^ “Men are men, ” continued She, “and tho’ they would raise their characters extremely by restraining their inclinations now and then, yet we must not expect to find Such exalted beinsis in the como

mon walks of life. When we do meet with them, indeed, they cannot be too highly prized. — But we are not to exclude ourselves from society, merely because there are more vicious than virtuous people in the world: on the contrary, we ought to endeavour, by our own exemplary conduct, and by mild, gentle, per

fuafive measures, to make them sensible of their errors, and to prevail on them to rectify them.”
In this manner did my good mother reason, Clara, and setting aside her will, which must ever be a law to me, I am
ft
dilpoftd to think pretty much in the same way. — As I have now acquainted you with the true state of my present situation, you will cease, I imagine, to be surprised at my behaviour, tho’ you may not, perhaps, approve of it. Whatever disappointments I may meet with in consequence of it, I shall not think myself blameable, because I follow the instruc
r
tions of one of the best of mothers, who has gone thro’ life with honour and happiness.

Miss EVELYN..
"T T E L L every letter you Send me V y, Surpriles me more and more. Beverly a received, accepted lover! Received with respect, yet with an indifference which— — stis all astonishment— — am
/
particularly astonished at the man’s being in earnest. Yet after what you have Said of Mrs. evelyn’s approbation, can I wonder at you? But if you really like the man,
L 4 is
V
224  .
is not your insenlibility beyond belief? Can Beverly behave with a coolness as if he was only your brother? Upon my word, my dear, you are all very uncommon people; So strange indeed, that there are hardly any people like you.
Having expressed my Serious amazement, you must now give me leave to laugh a little at the Sober trio composed by you, and your prudent mama, and that hypocritical rogue Beverly: hypocri tical I Say, for he. must be a finished deceiver. — You must also give me leave, Sophy, to alk you, whether you really think it necessary to behave with such excessive reserve to the man who is to be your husband— — whether a few liberties may not be allowed with the greatest discretion??
read your letter to Stanly; you Can
jnot take that amiss, my dear, as the ex
emplaiy
«
 . 225
emplary conduct of Beverly ought to be pointed out to him, that he may regulate his own by it. I dare not tell you his remarks upon it, lest you should be shocked with them: I will, however, inform you that he declared, if you was the most lovely, the most enchanting of your Sex, he would not marry you for a million, being Sure that you are colder than the coldest marble. I defended you as long as I could — “Say no more of her, ” cried he, “she is certainly more chilling than a water melon dipped in ice; my blood is congealed at the bare idea of such a woman. I should absolutely freeze by her fide.” Indeed, Sophy, when reserve is carried So far, it Smells strongly of affectation: and I cannot help Suspecting beverly’s sincerity; from what I know of his humour: and you might, I think, from what you know of it yourself, entertain fuljficions not
L 5 much
226  .
much to his advantage. Men are strange creatures; even the discreet miss Evelyn may be taken in as well as her giddy friend, — But I forgot — Beverly was always a Serious, Sober creature; it was I who made him otherwise, by trifling with him. I am exceedingly Sorry, indeed, that I should be So unfortunate in my conduct as to convert men virtuousty disposed into downright libertines. — I am vastly afraid there is a Something which irresistibly impels me to endeavour to attract the attention of every agreeable fellow who comes in my way. — There is Stanly, now: I cannot, for my life, keep him at the respectful distance you do Beverly: he not only wishes to be upon a more intimate footing with me than he is, but dares to vent his wishes in the warmest terms: yet as they are exprested with decency, and certainly very natural ones, I know not how to be
cruel

0
cruel to him. The liberties which he Solicits are allowable as I have consented td be his wife. — But, probably, you will have a very slight opinion of me, for this honest declaration of Sentiments So opposite to your own— — once thought, that our Sentiments were the Same upon this Subject: I never expected to find them fib entirely different: I always fancied myself as virtuous, as delicate as yourself,, though with a dispofition considerably more lively — I have ever had a propensity to communicate my thoughts without restraint to you, because I ever looked upon you as my real friend, and because I did not believe that I had any reason to be ashamed of them. Had they been improper, I "will venture to affirm that I should have, with equal freedom, dssclaimed them, having the utmost abhorrence of all kinds of deceit, : and even disguise,, that you

See me as I am. — Those people, therefore, who do not like either my conduct or my company, are desired to give themselves ♦no trouble about the first, and to avoid the last. conscious of the integrity of my intentions, lam equallyindifferentto the censure, and to the applause of the world: I am still, willing, however, if the extreme difference of our Sentiments will permit her to think foto subscribe myself, my dear sophy’s

miss WROUGHTON
AM Sorry, my dear Clara, that I happen to think so differently from you; yet I sometimes am apt to imagine that we only misunderstand each other, and mistake the meaning of each other’s words. I would fain account for our thwarting Sen
ft
timents in this manner, because I wish to preserve your affection and esteem, and also to prevail on you to act confistently with the understanding I know you are mistress of; and to convince you that your advice has been of slime service to me, I must tell you, that my mother has made
I
the strictest inquiries into Mr. beverly’s
/
cha
230  .
character and manners. The former she finds really good; and the latter only exceptionable from his having been thrown, by his situation in life, into connexions with wild young fellows, fond of pleasure and dissipation. We are assured by people who have known Mr. Beverly from his carliest youth, that he never was guilty of an action which ought to lessen him in the eyes of the most valuable part of mankind: we are also ashired that he has done
a number of friendly, and humane things;
* ^
being, naturally, of a benevolent and generous turn; ready to relieve every creature in distress, and to, aflist the industrious with his purse, his interest, or
his advice.
“He may be, nevertheless, very blame
0
able in his behaviour to women.”
True, my dear: but indeed I have heard it confidently asserted, that he never
took
ft
«
#
 . 2jt
took half the liberties with women by which his companions impertinently distinguished themselves: and that his impertinences have only been with women who threw themselves in his way. As to miss Garlies; he owns he was rather too free with her, but declares he was mistaken in her, and believes she was in him, or she would never have made Such a bustle about a trifle, as he really intended nothing more than a little raillery. This is the account he gives of the matter.: how far it is a j ust one I cannot determine,
%
but I am willing to think, that they were both under a mistake with regard to each
other — I can, at least, affirm, that he has
*
not yet been guilty of the ssightest deviation from decency — If he had, yon may be sure he never would have been admitted again. — To Say truth, he conducts himself with uncommon delicacy.
You

You see, Clara, I have not answered your letter in the Same rallying strain r: I have Serioussy taken up my pen in order to convince you, if possible, that we are not such strange out of the way people here as you imagine us to be, but that we act: agreeably to the shggestions of reason, which ought to be the guide of every body’s behaviour: without such a guide none will ever be happy themselves, or contribute to the felicity of others. ‘ As to your showing my letter to Stanly, I think you had better have kept it from his perusal, as it only furnished him with an opportunity to turn it into ridicule: however, his ridicule is thrown away upon me, for I look upon his Severe — in his own opinion, no doubt, witty — farcasms, as the highest compliment he could have paid me. — I am pleased, to be thought less susceptible than you, my
friend.
 , is;
friend, as long as I am not insenlible to merit: as long as I have a heart feelingly alive to filial tenderness and virtuous love. I cannot Say more without expressing myself with a romantic warmth; which I should deem very unbecoming, as I am ambitious of appearing in a domestic — quite an un romantk character. However, though we happen to think differently, Clara, do not imagine that I suspect you of being less virtuous, less delicate than myself — But while I am ready to do justice to your sincerity and uprightness, let me caution you again — I cannot caution you too often — against an unguarded behaviour with the man who discovers a licentious disposition— — such a man no woman can be Safe — permit me to add, few women can, with Such a man, be happy. I dare Say, Clara, that when
you reflect, coolly, upon what I have
now
234  .
now written to you, you will not find our Sentiments So widely different as you, at first, supposed them to be; and I am strongly of opinion, that I may still subscribe myself,
With the greatest propriety,
Your real friend, SOPHIA EVELYN.

Stanly has made me quite angry with him — I believe, indeed, that he has, like Beverly, been Spoilt by his connexions, yet if he is not to be reformed,! must, I fear, entirely discard him. Fear, did I Say? — I repeat the word — I feel that I love him immoderately — but I must tell you all. — The day before yesterday he took such monstrous liberties with me, that it was with difficulty I Saved myself.
“Why would you expose yourself to Such treatment?”

good genius interpoled, roused her from the delicious languor into which she had fallen, and gave her strength enough to repel all my attacks with a Spirit which I little expected; in short, I was utterly unable to carry my point, and yet I verily believe, that if I had persevered vi goroufiy I should have won the day.
Last night 1 hurried after her to Ranelagh: there I found her encircled by coxcombs of all sorts, fools of all denominations; but the most formidable fellow was an elegant little rascal, an Adonis — who, either totally ignorant of his own attractions, or dazzled by the lustre of her charms, plied her with the utmost assiduity: his attentions were unremitted the whole evening, and his behaviour most flatteringly relpectful; at the Same time that it was in the highest

She must be more than woman if she does not listen tp this new admirer, if she admits him to a tete a tete — What a confounded blow just when I was — had I but proved victorious, I had been for ever sure of her — as long, at least, as I chose to be constant — now — it is her turn to triumph. — So cool. So indifferent. So distractedly civil — Oh! the devil take all politeness, I Say, between the Sexes, especially when the woman is like Clara Wroughton. respect should be confined to the old and ugly: and yet this lovely, blushing creature will insist upon it, that her polite behaviour is necessary, in order to keep up her consequence, I suppose.

to listen to him again: never, my dear Clara, trust yourself even with the sight of him any more: you may fancy, perhaps, that the just indignation you, at present, feel, will get the better of your affection for him : yet do not trust yourself;; is poifori in that tongue, which would tempt you to your ruin. — You are too near him by being only in London, as you must, sometimes, unavoidably meet; a meeting may expose you to new trials; and I really think that another may be far worse than the foregoing ones.

Mr. SOMMERS.
I Am, indeed, as you say, become quite a convert to the virtues of my amiable Sophy. Never was there a lovelier, or a more discreet girl. She is the very woman a man would choose for a wife, among a thousand: she is very sensible, sufficiently lively, yet diffident and modest; and she is as ready to return the tenderness I discover for her, as her delicacy, for which she is remarkable, will permit her to be. Never did I see a woman of a milder, sweeter disposition, more studious to oblige, oc more humble : yet, with all her gentleness, file has a proper reserve in her
N
manner.

manner, which, by inspiring awe, prevents you from taking any improper freedoms, She is, indeed, chafie in the ftrongesb sense of the word. She is not only virtuous herself, she makes everybody so who converses with her. I had always conceived a mortal aversion to your over rigid females. My Sophy, with the utmost purity, is engaging beyond expreshon. With such a companion, Sommers, I can never be unhappy. She has an inherent gooclnefs in her temper, which renders her truly estimable. Her talents for conversation are numerous and delightful, and she is mistress of so many different ways of pleasing, that you have not the least desire to wander from her in starch of variety. It is, in a great measure, ow shg to these vrinning changes that I am > so violently attached to her; and I am

under no apprehensions of feeling any tiresome languors in her society— —. rare equalities must she pofsefs, to keep a man constant, as times go! — She is the only woman in the world, I believe, who can cure me of roving: and yet my rovings were never, I flatter myself, criminal. — I have rambled about a good deal, from mere idleness, and have, to be sure, often changed for the worst in my amorous pursuits: perhaps I was the more fickle, becaust I never found a woman who had merit enough to fix me. — Do I not, by this confession, prove myself too nice? But then, at the same time, do I not pay a greater compliment
ft
to my Sophy, who destrves the highest encomiums from me?

Your lall letter deserves rny best
thanks; Sophy: it was a very
friendly one; equally friendly was your
shvitation, but I cannot accept of it at.
present. I have, a tlioufand engagements
upon my hands. — A new lover, child :
only the sweetest fellow in the world: —
and yet — but I must tell you a little
about him : Lord Southern is the man,
the'eldest fon of the Earl of THE
was introduced to me t’other night at:
Ranelagh : he is, what you may call,,
B 4 quite:
S F E M A DE .d R A r L T Yc
quite a male beauty: he is tall, and delicately formed : his complexion is fair
f
he has languishing blue eyes; his features are regular; he has fine light hair, and the most beautiful hand I ever beheld— — short, he would, probably, be a narcifsus, were he not so entirely taken up with me, as not to have
ft
leisure to admire himself: : am not, however, vain of my conquest: I never was so indifferent about any man since I was born; though I really think no man ever loved me so sincerely as this young Southern does: I believe he is come too late, or elfe I could not be insensible; for he has not only a great deal of personal beauty, he has a cultivated understanding, and a refined taste,
ft '
and Seems to be a good-natured, generous creature. What a pity is it, Sophy, that I did not know him Sooner!
Thpre

There is no altering one’s destiny. My heart can own but one lord; and. as he is unworthy of my attention, I shall think no more about men, only to amuse myself with them.. I have not told Southern so; but I gave him no hopes,, when, he poured out a fervent wish, that I was dssengaged,. Yet I cannot prevent his following me everywhere; tho’ he is by no means impertinent: he behaves with a respect; that would charnii even you, Sophy. Good manners will, not permit me to forbid his visits.

his name; but then he mu; st not engross my thoughts: besides, as you have hitherto had a regular account of his behaviour,, you ought to know how he conducts himself upon this occa

However, since Lord Southern became acquainted with me, he is, apparently, very curious; so curious, indeed, that if he had not been my professed lover, I Should call him the most troublesome impertinent breathing. He follows us,
he watches us, he listens
%
night, at Ranelagh, while I, in better spirits than usual, was laughing at something Lord Southern had told me, I happened to turn my head to speak to Lady Jane Selby, and saw Stanly engaged in her party.
Looking full in my face, he fell into the most virulent invectives against those women, who flirt with every man who comes in their way.
I could not help taking his invectives to myself, they were so evidently pointed at me.
Turning

Turning immediately to Lord Southern, I said,, a Smile, Do yous think it neceltary, my Lord,, for a woman to be so particularly attached to one man,. as to quarrel with, another who admires her?
“Certainly not,. Madam, ” ’ replied! he: “a beautiful woman may moss properly extend her smiles to all, tho’" she grants her favours to none, .”
Stanly frowned, and. muttered something like “Coxcomb !” • — a word which. I am sure my Lord did not hear, or he would have relented it. — Was not Southern reply a pretty one now! — • Well, I actually thanked him aloud for it, telling him, that I looked upom it as an encouragement for us to Say anci. do what we pleased.
Stanly walked off in a contemptuotis, manner. Lord Southern answtred,

“cannot want permission. Madam, to speak and act agreeably to your inclination, which muss ever be a law to all who are so happy as to know you.” There, my dear — what a difference between the two men!
“What flattery! ”
Perhaps you are right; but there is something extremely bewitching in good breeding. And yet I cannot bring myself to love this pretty fellow; this very pretty fellow, as I muss, in spite of all
my indifference, allow him to be. — Stanly, with his manly graces, with his
seducing, with his eloquent tongue, with his fhort breathed ssghs, with the tender pressures of his hands, and with his lost, insinuating whispers— — may love more sincerely than Stanly, but Stanly is a thousand times the more agreeable
lover; and, would he have a little patience.
 . 13
tience, we may, both, be happy. — Yet I must learn — t hard as the tash is — to forget him. I fear, Sophy, with you, that there is no trussing him. I do not,
indeed, know whether he wishes to be received again. There is a great deal more anger than love in his eyes at present: his frowns are absolutely insupportable.
— I will talk no more about him.
Southern was exceedingly officious the whole evening; so assiduous, so attentive to my every look and every motion — he seemed to breathe for me alone. — But it will not do, Sophy, as I said before. However indiscreet you may think me, I am consoled with this fatif factiion — 1 am, by no means, the flirt Sir Edward imagines me to be.
And now pray tell me something about tsour affair. You are really then
going

going to be married to Beverly? Well,, if he is the good sort of creature you believe him, you are to be commended,, in my opinion, for taking him while hers in the humour.! — Nobody, you may be assured, wishes your happiness with: him more than

Lord BEAUFORD.
I AM half distracted with doubts and fears: this Southern will certainly get her. He is soberly, seriously in love with
her. — Who, indeed, is not? yet I, Sometimes, fancy that I lee nothing of the tender kind in her for him. She smiles, and she is civil: but will smiles alone satisfy the ardent lover? Will unmeaning civility content the man whole whole soul is devoted to such a woman as Clara Wroughton? Such a lover would be very unworthy of her: utterly undelerving of a heart susceptible of the warmest emo'

tions. — Such emotions Clara once felt for me. — What has happened then to occasion so sudden a change in her? Has her virtue occasioned it? She is the more to be valued — and I ought to love her with redoubled tenderness, for an alteration in her behaviour to me so much to her honour. — But she will not see me; she will not Speak to me — she will undoubtedly listen to this Southern in time, and as undoubtedly give him her hand whether she loves him or not. — His family, his rank, his fortune, and his connexions are all powerful advocates for him; and the world — especially the female world — will think her mad to reject so desirable an alliance. She will, therefore, in all probability, sell herself purely to be thought to have acted 2i prudent part, rather than give herself to the man who. really loves her, who dotes on her; to the
man
 . r;
man whom Jhe loves. — Yes — Ihe certainly did love me — she, poshbly,. may Jiill love me, notwithstanding the beauty of
her Adonis. He is strangely handsome, and when he gazes eagerly at her with his long languishing eyes, he puts me in mind of those lovers in romances who are drawn extravagantly beautiful. You see, Harry, my reading is not confined to serious history, and matters of facl books.' The truth is, I have perused a great many delectable Ilories invented by the tribe of fanciful authors. — But to the point. Clara may be fully sensible of the personal charmshs of her new admirer, and yet prefer me; and if Sire does prefer me, I shall have great reason to triumph. I once heard a very plain but very agreeable woman, speaking of her lover, say, “I am doubly obliged to him, for he has not only given me his heart, but beauty
to

to preei've it.” If Clara, therefore, should prefer me to this fine young fellow —

My Servant has jull; brought me advice that Mrs. Morden has taken a house at Richmond for the summer, and that she and Clara remove to it next week.
Excellent! that’s a sign she has no aversion to one of us, and most probably I am the man; for 1 will lay any sum that Southern would follow her to the extremity of the kingdom, and that she sees I will, as she is not quite so severe at present as she has been. She would be loth, therefore, to go out of my way.
I am not very well. Late hours and what is called the bell company, play the devil with a man’s constitution, if he is not a Hercules. — A little air will certainly be serviceable to me, and foi will dispatch

YOU, really, then, my dear, are
to be Mrs. Beverly in less than a fortnight? All happiness attend my amiable Sophy in every change of life 1 — It is impossible for me to come down at this time; but I hope to see both you and Beverly before the summer is over. — I Shall be glad to See how you both appear in the characters of man and wife: characters not very frequently supported with a striking propriety. I confess
20  .
fess I have not the smallest doubts concerning your behaviour; but I cannot help entertaining some apprehensions with regard to my friend beverly’s. He never, I must: own, seemed to me fusti ciently qualified to act the husband in a
becoming manner. — Now I think Lord
«
Southern would be quite the thing, because he would idolise his wife. He appears to have an extreme tenderness of heart; and is certainly formed, by the softness of his disposition, to pity even those whom he cannot love : those whom he admires, he adores. And yet, Sophy, it is not in my power to give him my heart: I should rather say, it is notin my power to take it from that dear deceiver, who has but too firmly fixed it for his own, I fear, for ever. — Well; since it must be foi, from this moment, fet all men at defiance. — It is my
'design,
ft
ft
 . 21
design, to trifle away the rest of my life without encouraging a serious thought about any of them.
I would not, however, have you imagine that I intend to feed any man with false hopes, who deserves better treatment from me. Southern is really, in my opinion, entitled to the fairest treatment from me: I therefore told him,
\
t’other day, that I was obliged to him for the honour he did me; but that I had no intentions to alter ray present plan of life.
He looked dejected, and replied —
“Time, I hope. Madam, and my increasing attentions to gain so valuable a
heart as yours, will make a change in your sentiments“
“you are really in earnest, my Lord, ” answered I, gravely, “I wish you would not flatter yourself with such

expectations, as I am sure they will be
s'.
frustrated.”
He sighed, and was filent for sometime. — He then said— — “you are ol the heavenly disposition you appear tc be in my eyes, Miss Wroughton, yot will not refuse me the favour I am going to solicit. Tho’ you cannot bless mt with your love, ” continued he, iighin^ more deeply, “can you deny me the next felicity, your friendship? — Yov may surely venture to receive me a' your friend: I shall not abuse youi kindness; nor give the man, whom yon render the happiest of his sex, reason to be in the least alarmed on my account, ” I smiled— — not in the most forbidding manner, I believe. Where is the woman, Sophy, who can be ill natured to a gentle, generous lover?
Mj
✓
 . 23
My Lord Saw nothing forbidding in my behaviour. — He seized my hand, and with a respectful, yet impassioned air, pressed it to his lips.
I did not draw it back in a hurry. The poor fellow, I thought, deserved a little indulgence: for surely no man ever received his sentence with a luorc affecting concern.
Nov, perhaps, you, with your jstrict modesty, may imagine, that I ought not to have let him mumbled my hand so. — But, indeed, child, you are quite out. one’s hand is nothing at all, of no Sort of consequence, while one’s heart is free. There lies all the danger: and I swear to you, that while she devoured my hand with his kisses, he made no more impression upon me, than if he had kissed the Chinese figure upon the chimney-piece. I am so much used to
these
#
 .
these matters, that they have no effect upon me : they are not of the slightest importance, — However, as my lover seemed to be tolerably satisfied with my pafilvenefs, I was pleased. I was glad to give him any kind of quiet, without
»
acting in opposition to my principles; because I really think he is unhappy about me. He is extremely delicate, both in his person, and in his manner. I wish I could do him jullice; but it is impossible.
My aunt had agreed for a house, during the summer, ready furnished, at Richmond; but as some little disputes arose between her and her landlord, she has taken one at Twickenham unfurnished. — I like it much better than the other, as there is a very pleasant garden to it. When it can be got ready for us, we are to leave London, and
only
9
 . 25
only to go thither, occasionally, for a night or two; at least, till November; and then the country, I think, as well as I love it, begins to grow dreary and disagreeable.. You will tell me, I suppose, that it grows so, because I cannot be happy in retirement: but, indeed you are mistaken, Sophy. Nobody is
more fond of tranquillity than myself; V ith the man I love, I should be blessed in a desert— — this time, I imagine, you can make the same kind of Ipeech to your futur.

I
TO
#
Sir EDWARD STANLY.
I Have hitherto met with nothing but disappointments.
On my arrival at the town nearest to Mr. Garliesss estate, I was informed thar he and his family were gone to make a fortnight’s visit to a Mr. forbes’s, about twenty miles farther northward. I curbed my impatience as well as I could, and amused myself with riding to see everything that was most curious about the country; and, to say truth,
made
4^
 . 27
. made Forbes place in my way; not advancing too near, however: but I heartily wish now that I had advanced; as matters might not have been carried sofar, to my great uneasiness: for, the first night Mr. Garlies returned home, I heard that he had received a very advantageous offer for his daughter from Sir Arthur Coningham, a young Baronet, with a good character, and a large estate : yet, as I did not dfo hear that the match was concluded, I went, the next day, and introduced myself as a person who had the pleasure of being acquainted with Mils Garlies in London, and desired the favour of being permitted to renew our acquaintance in
V
the North.
The amiable girl was present, and blushed exceedingly, on her father’s only, with an assenting bow, desiring
C 2 me
•4
28  .
me to be seated. She looked exceed ingly disconcerted: : made a. great effort to recover herself; and, at length, got courage to tell her father the little piece of service I had fortunately done her. By communicating that intelligence to him, she occasioned an irrime diate change in his behaviour to me.' He then welcomed me in the warmest and most hospitable manner. The dear girl’s countenance immediately brightened up, and, upon the strength of the alteration in her father’s carriage, ventured, tho’. t with a winning modesty, to enter into a
conversation with me.
Mr. Garlies pressed me to dine with him, and I consented. He then ashed me to walk over his gardens, as the weather was not too warm. On my
f
desiring Miss Garlies to favour us with her company, she looked at her father
for
9
 . 29
for his approbation: and immediately weiit to fetch her bonnet.
While she was absent, I availed myself of that opportunity to expatiate
upon the charms of her person and her
■*
manners, the last of which had fixed me irrevocably hers; though I forbore to mention my sentiments upon that subject, till I could hear her sentiments concern -- ing me, — Fortune favoured my wishes.
t
Mr. Garlies, having been sent for by a perfpn who came about business to him, left me with his daughter, bidding her to entertain me; and adding, that he would send her mother to ashft her.
I seized that interesting moment, and
V
made a full declaration of my pashon. —
“I came down, miss Garlies, on purpose to ash your father’s consent to visit ypu.” '
C 3 ^ Her
\.
30  .,
Her fair face glowed with blushes r she threw down her pretty eyes, but was Silent.
I pressed her to tell me, if she had any objection to my design;; by way of apology for the abruptness of my declaration, that I was too sincerely desirous of making her happy, to. attempt to prejudice Mr. Garlies in my
Savour, tijl I knevr her sentiments
•,
Still blushed, but thanked me; and, after a little hesitation, Said, “My father’s pleasure, iny Lord, has ever
I
been mine; and I think it my duty
to comply with whatever he. chposes,
/
for me.”
“But if Mr garlies’s choice, ” replied I, “Should not accord with your inclination, will you, Madam, rather
venture to be unhappy, than dissent
from
%
dc.
 . 31
from him in a point in which your felicity is deeply concerned ?”
“As my father will never advise me to follow any measures, my Lord, ” replied she, “but what he thinks most likely to make me happy: and as he must, necessarily, know a great, deal more of the world.than I do, I shall run a very small risque, I imagine, by submitting to his pleasure“
“good a daughter, Miss Garlies, ” answered I, “will, undoubtedly, make an excellent wife: yet I must confess I
should be happier in being freely chosen by you, than only by your father. And as I am encouraged by you to endeavour to obtain your father’s consent, I shall trouble you no farther at present; I shall content myself with hoping, from your encouraging carriage, that you would give me the preference to any of
V 4 your
%
32  '.
V
your other admirers, ' were not your duty at variance with your inclination.”
She looked most agreeably embarrassed; but as Mrs. Garlies came up to us at that moment, fly could not return any answer.
Mrs. Garlies is a fine woman : you may believe me when I tell you that her daughter very much resembles her in her
person— — been informed by her husband, I suppose, of my rank in life,
she treated me with the greatest politeness.
I spent the day at Garlies place, and staid till the evening was very far advanced, in hopes of getting a moment to Speak to Nancy alone; but, as other company came in, 1 found it imposhble to act agreeably to my wishes; and foi left them, after having told Mr. Garlies (who waited on me to the door) that
1 would
t
 . 33
I would do myself the honour of calling on him in the morning, as I had some particular business to Settle with him.
I vent, in consequence of my appointment. I found him alone, and acquainted him with my wishes to become his fon.
He politely thanked me for the honour I had done him, in making choice of his daughter; adding, that he was sorry his word was already given to Sir Arthur Coningham.
“And not with Miss garlies’s approbation, Sir?” cried I, eagerly, with emotions which I could not conceal.
“My daughter, my Lord, ” replied he, “has made no objections to Sir Arthur; nor do I imagine that she can have any objection to so agreeable and io cvccomplished a man; and as lie has
C 5 obtained
• •
34  .
obtained my promise, 1 cannot recede from it.”
ft
I was obliged to go away vrith this ^ chilling answer, without feeing Miss Garlies; but the impression which she has made upon me, with the idea of her being preposstefted in my favour, will
not be easily effaced from my mind. — I
•* »
am, indeed, so closely attached to this part of the country, that I do not know how to quit it. ^I seek all opportunities; to speak to her alone, that I may learn from her own lips whether she really prefers me to my rival. Shoukl I be so happy — and I sometimes foolishly imagine I am — the preferred lover, I will leave nothing undone to gain her from, my competitor, let him be ever so formidable. — Permit me to tell you, in the mean time, that I am sorry to find you still perfist: in trying to undermine the

T O
Lord BLAULORD.
YOU advise imposlibilities. Clara
is not made in a soft, forgiving mould. She is not of the pliant disposition you imagine her to be. She may be virtuous, perhaps. Does not every woman appear so when she refuses to yield to the man whom she does not love? That niust be the cafe here; as Miss Wroughton. will not receive me, but permits Lord Southern to visit her continually. Now as he is evidently her favourite, she certainly gives me up with no relufiant sensation— — I talk strangely, Beauford — You think I am angry with Clara— — never doted on her more
than
 . sh
sj i
than I do at this moment, and yet my pride will not let me stoop to alk her pardon. Pardon 1 for V hat after all? Did not my offence — if it can be called offence — proceed from love alone? Did it not refuit from the most ardent, the most impassioned tenderness?? can shere, fon ably, be displeased V ith me for carrying that tenderness to the highest; pitch? Certainly not. The veriest: prude in nature, the most extravagantly vir tuous woman in the universte could but have flown from me as ftje did, and have
ft
received me afterwards as if nothino:
O
particular had happened. — Instead of receiving me again, she was denied to me, twice, when I called: and she is always

These are the steps most of your vinuous women take to secure an honourable lover, who, poor devil, finds the scene quite altered when he becomes a husband. When he has saved the lady’s reputation, fettled a good jointure on her, and loaded her with presents, che finds her ready to take a new danoler into her service, by way of Cedjhes, who will, probably,
be better received by her, and more highly favoured than her husband is, vrho fooiifiily furnished her with the most enviable accommodations of life, without dreaming that for those, accommodations

<
j.
that she ever directly told me that she
V

As to Nancy Garlies, she is, I suppose, just Such another little hypocrite as her friend Clara: though there is not a Single grain of friendship in the composition of either of them. Pride, vanity, and sordid felsishnefs are the cardinal Aces of three fourths of the sexto one of whom you are in such a confounded hurry to join yourself for life :. but since neither advice nor warning;

Stanly has taken lodgings at Kew, anc throws himself, perpetually, in my way but I have not yet taken more notice ol him than I could well help. — I will own. however, that I have been violentlj tempted to Show a little consideratior
for him, on his feemins: to humble him

exceedingly. Yet I am afraid oi going too far; and, as I do not intent to receive him as I did before he of fended me, I think it better to be rather distant, and reserved to him; anc I believe Southern thinks so too;. for h( is ever close at my elbow, and canduct; himself in every respect like a friend

the very character in which he wished to appear, as I could not entertain him for
a lover.
Upon my word, Sophy, now you are married, and gone for ever from me, I may as well make Southern supply your place : for, though I feel the same affection for you I ever did, I cannot
suppose that you, with your rigid prin
» •
can keep anything from your husband. Southern is as mild as my Sophy; besides, he has already found me out, tho’ he certainly wants not to be told, that Stanly was an accepted lover, and must see that he is no longer received in that character: but he sees still more than 1 desire: for he told me, in a whisper, the last night we were at Ranelagh, that Sir Edward Stanly wa the most enviable man in the world.
ft
I did
46  .
I did. not, at first;, comprehend hi meaning; but supposing that he envied him on account of his being so much admired by the women, I replied, ir order to give him a little confoiation — He is really an elegant figure. — 1 fancy, my Lord, you are full as enviable in his eyes, as he can poliibly be in yours.”
Were I blessed as Sir Edward is. Madam, ” answered he softly“ “the
‘0 ^
smiles of the only woman by whom 1 wifa to be distinguished, I should indeed merit the envy of every human being.”
1 felt my face in a glow on having been discovered by his penetrating eyes. — My oy/n eyes betrayed me: I threw them down; and hoped, by that proceeding, to hide what pasted in my heart.
Beginning to recover myself a little, in a few moments, I raised my head, and
favi

saw Stanly looking at me with a mixture
of anger and tenderness— — was still
more disconcerted; I could not help
ftghing when I found southern’s hand
in mine, who was pointing out a very
ridiculous figure at a small distance;
»
kindly endeavouring, by drawing off my attention to indifferent objects, to restore me to myself; to Save me, at least, from
i
the observations of the company round us.
I was too much embarrafied to perceive his design immediately; but I soon,
, %
into it, and thanked him in the
I
most obliging manner for his politeness.
— Transported with my acknowledgments, he redoubled his assiduities to make, the remainder of the evening pass away without any disagreeable interruptions.

He will be a thon fand times more likely to soften me wit tenderness, than with resentment.
Lord Southern has such a quantity C tenderness in his disposition, that he ii think, completely qualified to Shine a friend, tho’ he may be Sometimes i too melting a strain for a lover.

•ik.
WELL, my dear,. I must talce your
advice — whether I will or no. Stanly has quite deserted me. He is perpetually with a Miss Bushy, who is reckoned a fine girl; she is one of your large, showy brunettes, with a pair of iparkling black eyes, and a colour like a catharine peach. She is, however, esteemed the handsomest woman in this place, and is not a little proud of being followed by so fine a fellow as Stanly.
His
 . 57
His title and estate have, I dare say, made as deep an impression upon her as his figure and address. If I really thought she had done as much execution on him as he has on her, I should not be able to write so cheerfully: but I look upon Stanly as one of those men who cannot
exist without an attachment of some
•<
and who dangles after women merely to kill time. — Yet, though his
.behaviour appears to me in this light, he may not be, actually, foiiarmlefs: for I have often heard both you and Mrs. Evelyn say, that a woman cannot be more prejudiced than by being much talked of. Miss Bushy, therefore, is in some danger, as all Twickenham is in a bustle about her. Stanly is coming continually to breakfast at her father’s, a man whom nobody knows— — people think he is worth money *, others, that he has no
D 5 fortune
58  .
«
fortune at all, but that he intends to make a good deal of his handsome daughter. The whole family — father, mother, daughter, and cousin— — ugly girl who serves as a soil to Msss Bushy — are persons of no education: They certainly show very little knowledge of the world, by the transports which they discover on Sir edward’s intimacy with them.
We happened to be near theni last; Sunday night sh Richmond gardens. One would, really, have imagshed they had never Spoken to a Baronet before: it was Sir Edward at every syllable: and I dare say the girl, if she could any way draw him in to marry her, would be almost out of her wits to hear herself called My Lady, and Your Ladyship, without be ftowing a thought upon the charming fellow who had given her those titles. — • But Stanly cannot, poshbly, tie himself
for
y
 . 59
for life to a creature without any taste or sentiment. He may, perhaps, be struck with her persona little, just by way of variety; yet I think ihe must, upon a nearer acquaintance, disgust him. There is no answering, however, for men: they have the strangest, the most unaccountable fancies, sometimes— — then they are seldom lasting.
I am rejoiced, believe me, my dear Sophy, to find you are so happy: I am also much pleased to find that Beverly, after having been so very volatile, is become a serious, constant, tendct husband. If one fickle fellow can change so greatly for the better, why not another? I begin to have some hopes of Stanly : should he be converted into a new man, I do not see, I confess, why he may not be received by a woman of character, as well as Beverly, You will
D 6 tell
i
6o  .
tell me, probably, that Beverly never attempted to take those liberties with you, which Stanly has taken with me : but if a man commits an error once in his life, must he never be forgiven? — Such a way of thinking is a very severe one; and it is, in my opinion, repugnant both to reason and religion: and the truly religious are never unforgiving. Were I sure that Stanly would return, and behave like a man of honour, could I reject him? But it is not the expectation of ibis return which prevents me from clofmg with Lord Sou them’s generous proposals: : truth is, I cannot love Lord Southern as I ought: and II I cannot feel the same affection for hirr as he, undoubtedly, feels for me, I shall, by giving, him my hand, be guilty oi ‘downright prostitution: I shall not onl) make myself exceedingly miserable, bj
unitim

uniting myself to him, but injure him in the highest degree, by hindering him from being closely connected with a woman whose taste and principles, whose sentiments and whose temper are similar to his own. These, Sophy, are my reasons for declining his offer; ind I hope you will, on mature consideration, acknowledge the justness of them. — But why mufti break off all acquaintance with him? Have you not, frequently, told me, that I could not prudently have connexions with a man whom I loved, without marriage, but that I might receive a man whom I did not love, without running any risques?? you must allow that the conversation
of a sensible, well-bred man is not only more agreeable, but infinitely more instructive, than the insignificant tittle tattle of our own sex. Every man of sense,

After having fixed upon a good

on my Scheme against Clara Wroughton, I began to ply her pretty closely in all places in which we ftiould be, most probably, observed; concluding, that, if we were but seen together, Clara would soon hear of us. But, whether She fancied, from the personal difference between the object: of my choice and herself, that I was only playing the lover, whether She was really become quite easy about me, or whether Ihe had absolutely determined to marry Southern — I cannot fay: I only know that I found her entirely unaffected by the procedure which would, I thought, have given no small disturbance to sher mind. This
ft
disappointment chagrined me considerably: : disgusted too by the excessive fondness of my Dulcinea, and the surfeiting civilities of her father and mother, I determined to look out for a

goddess more suitable to my taste— — soon favoured me, by throwinj Lady Lucy H. in my way: her mother the Countess, came down to Kew so the air, and for the recovery of her spirits.
I made an acquaintance with Lad Lucy on horseback, in one of my morr ing rides, and find her much fitter fc my purpose than Miss Busby was : sh is very delicate in her form, and quit the woman of fashion in her manner; I have carried her twice out in my phat tonne. The last time, I met, in Bush park, Lord Southern driving Clara i
his whisky. Would you believe it? was So disconcerted at the rencontn that I was within an ace of overturnin my companion, who, though highl pleased with her airing, could hardl refrain from fcreamins; with terroi

We were, indeed, in so much danger,
that Southern, like a man of gallantry, jumped out‘ of his own vehicle, and
came to assist my servants in holding the horses, which, being young and spirited, could, with difficulty, be kept from flying out of the track they were in.
I thanked Lord Southern for his politeness and humanity, and, at any other time, ffiould have hurried to Clara, who sat alone in the chair, and looked like an angel, Sull of loveliness and goodness.
But instead of running to entertain her, in the absence of her Adonis, I bulled myself about my own companion, and endeavoured to laugh her out of her fears; taking care, at the Same time, to appear, by proper looks and gestures, as if I was Saying an immense number of tender things to her. — And yet clara’s features — for I every now and then

There is a something which sweetly.. us under our disquietudes, while we are difelofing them to a sincere friend. I have, therefore, taken up my pen, oppressed with Sorrow, to inform you that Stanly is irrecoverably lost : — He has, at length, met with the very

We met, accidentally, in Buftiy pari t’other day. After numberless solicitations, I had consented to be drove b Lord Southern in his whisky. Sir Edward, like a superior being, came driving down upon, us, in his phaeton, witi Lady Lucy.
On a sudden, the horses, as impa tient as their m after, sprung out of th road, and dragged the carriage aft

Stanly jumped out, and addrelsed himself politely to my Lord, but took not the least notice of me; returned to his companion, who seemed half dead with fear, and soothed her in the tenderest
ft ^
manner. I experienced, indeed, the Same treatment, but not from him, from Lord Southern, who, feeing me ready to saint, begged me to let him go to the first house, and fetch something to revive me; expressing what, I believe, he really felt, a great deal of concern at the disorder which I •^could not conceal; tho’, to Spare my confusion, he affected not to perceive the cause of it.

Kitty Busby, whom I followed a little while, only to see if Clara would be jealous, is become furiously so, herself, of Lady Lucy: nay, she was so indiscreet, as to insult her at the Hampton alsem bly, and in the moll absurd manner.
As Lady Lucy was the only woman of quality there that night, I led her to begin the dance. Busby, flouncing by her, and placing herself above her, said“ “you have got my man from me, you shall not have my places
Lady Lucy looked astonished, yet seemed not inclined to regard her — She gave me her hand, and I led her immediately above Kitty.
Just when we were going to cast off Kitty, stepping, hastily, across her, rudely pushed her almost down; and, bidding her partner follow her, added, “I

TO
Sir EDWARD STANLY.
I AM in the most disagreeable Situation imaginable; I am convinced that I ' am preferred by Miss G arlies to Sir Arthur, and yet I have no hopes of ever getting her into my possession.
It was with great difficulty that I discovered her partiality for me. — After having employed my time chiefly in endeavouring to find out the places ffie frequented, in which I might not only See
her —

  8i
her — the sight of her only would not satisfy me — but Hand a chance of hearing her sentiments about me, and of discovering what her feelings were on my account — After shaving made several fruitless efforts. to' gratify my curiosity, fortune, at last, befriended me.
As. I constantly repaired to all the em virons about Mr. garlies’s estate, I was happy enough, one day, to behold his daughter in the park,, walking slowly up and down in a pensive manner.
I was over the boundary in a moment,
which was only a low paling,, and. came
»
her by surprise.
She started, coloured; like crimson;; pronounced my name in faltering accents.
I endeavoured, at the lame: time, to compose her fluttered spirits, and in

treated her to tejl me if Sir Arthur was

really the man of her choice.
“My father’s choice niuft be mine, my Lord.”
That reply she repeated.
#
“Undoubtedly, ” answered I; but only tell me, would you choose to give your hand to Sir Arthur Coningham, if your father desired you to act agreeably to your inclination? This is the last question, Miss Garlies, with which I shall, perhaps, ever trouble you; for if you are refoived to accept of Sir arthur’s offer, I will immediately quit this part of the country, and try, with the assistance of new objects and scenes, to banifti you from my thoughts; tho’ the idea of your being destined to another’s arms, will, I fear, totally destroy my peace.”
She sighed, at my pressing her for an answer, and turned away her face — I

held her hand, and attempted to make some apology. foe the embarralsment which! had. occasioned.
For several moments her Spirits were greatly agitated— — length,, hovveyer,. Ihe recovered herself enough to say — ** Spare me, my Lord,, I cannot discover
my sentiments upon this subject— — null: obey my father— — choice, as I said before, must be mine— — I shall never, ”
added she, with a gentle ftgh, “restect

With these words she was leaving me,, but I detained her.: ^ — Would not that

Sir Arthur had engaged Mr. garlies’y promise?” ?”
“not alk me any more questions, my Lord, ” replied Ihe, blushing exces fively: “it is very improper for me to hear any more.”
“There can be no impropriety, ” said I, “in your giving me all the ease in
i
your power.
“And shall you be happier, ” replied she, “if I say that my father’s approbation of your addresses would have been quite agreeable to me, when I know that you can never obtain it ?”
“I shall, indeed, ” answered I, pressing her hand eagerly — ■ “Tour approbation will be so transporting, that it will enable me to surmount all difficulties.”

A faint smile just gleamed over her

She broke from me abruptly, and begged me to leave the park immediately. I pleaded hard for another interview, but to no purpose. She flew, like a fearful fawn, to avoid the approaching group, and soon concealed herself in a little grove: not thinking herself secure there, however, Ihe would hurry on to another place, and fell over the trunk of a tree which lay across the path, and was not observed by her.
As soon as I saw her down, I quickly, regardless of any consequences, reached the spot, and arrived just time enough to raise her in my arms.

Sir EDWARD STANLY
T O
Lord BEAUFORD.
I Could laugh immoderately, Harry, were I not vexed to death, at the behaviour of this,, perverse Clara — Your girl is jdst on thdpoint of running full Speed into your arms, while mine — the whole and Sole miftress of my heart, is still uncomeatable. — My other women are all ready to do — just what I please to have them: they are indeed, too ready.
Lucy is rather fulsomely Sond; but it is a mighty difficult matter, I find, to get
that capricious animal, a woman, in the right humour. Clara now appears to be
exactly
i
92  .
exactly of the same temper with mysel - — She can, I dare say, be all love ani languishment one minute,, and the next full of wit and vivacity enough to make us enjoy our raptures with a double re lilh, and to prevent the repetition C them from being attended with fatiet) With Clara I dare promife myself never ending variety, or you may be ashire that I never ftiould have thought of mai rying her. However, as she has chosen t drive me from her,, you cannot fuppo: that I Iliall ever pay her the same compl ment again. — No — If She ever Ihoul happen, in a penitential fit, to have mind to me again, she must ask me;; ar
I really imagine, that ftie Sometirai looks as if she would be glad to come 1 terms; but as Lady Lucy, or Souther is always in the way, we are not vei
like
 . 9^
likely to strike up an accommodation between us.
We were all at the play house at Richmond last night. Clara was in company with a very agreeable girl whose father lives at Twickenham. This girl would have been diftinguiftied. by me before, bad I not had so many affairs upon my hands. She is more elegant than handsome, and has a remarkable delicacy in her carriage. She looked rather like a pretty attendant on Clara, than as her equal. No body can equal Clara; and I do not believe that Emma Melville ever thought of putting herself upon a par with her; to the credit of her under handing be it mentioned.
Lord Southern attended them, and was as usual attentive to Clara, though very polite to her companion. I was with Lady Lucy. Clara, I thought, now and then
stole
p4  ,
Hole a glance at us: She Seemed uncommonly Serious, and pensively Sat, durin| the latter part of the performance, lean ing her head upon her hand, and looking exquisitely handsome. So lovely indeet was her appearance, that I could fcaro keep my eyes from gazing at her. One or twice I forgot that Lady Lucy wa speaking to me.
When the play was over, Colone Fletcher went into the box in whici miss Wroughton sat. Having a fen words to Say to him, I hastened, withou thinking, to him — I was dole to Clara whose back was turned to me. Just as was going to make a reply to what th colonel had said, I heard Clara fetch; deep sigh. I could not contain myself— — cried I — inftantaneoully involuntarily : “what means that sigh?” ?”

#.

Sfc
She turned her head hastily, her face and neck glowed like scarlet— — hastily did Ihe avert her face from me to hide it.
I was struck;; was charmed with her agitated behaviour; with her unexpected emotions. Upon the strength of that behaviour, and those emotions, I ventured to seize her hand, to sigh out — though too faintly to be heard by the rest of the company — “My angel !’* — But Ihe, without deigning to look at me, drew away her hand in a hurry, and continued to sit with her back towards me, though Southern told her, several times, that her carriage waited. She staid, I suppose, to see if I would not go first: finding, however, that I was, obstinately, determined to See her out, she rose, and with an incon ceivable dignity in her air, pafted by me without Seeming to See me, though I made way for her, and bowed profoundly

while Southern led her along. You S what a haughty gypsy Ihe is; and y that involuatary sigh, and some othi symptoms which, in spite of all her a fectied pride and reserve, escaped he prompt me to believe, that She woul have been very glad to make it up wii
me — I will not Say upon what condition I must be cautious, therefore — I mu proceed with circumspection. Wome of her sense and penetration are not 1 readily duped, as your yielding fimpl tonnes. — Yes, fimpletons th will be evi deemed by us, Harry, who fall into oi shares, however we may complimei them upon their fne understandings, to fac litate the execution of our designs again their poor soft hearts. — Yet I hat - known Jome women with a great deal ( good sense, as well as with a great deal ( nice sensibility, become victims to the
m

cwn inclinations: let me rather say, to our deshes. Whether Clara is one of these women or not, I cannot yet positively declare.
^ _ N
As to your girl, Harry, you mean northing unfair or dishonourable you know. — Why there is not a Single doubt but' that she will fly with you to any place whatever; and though these hasty marriages are prohibited in England, yet Scotland is open to accommodate every honest couple who chuse to do everything according to law, though not quite according to the intentions of the legislature. Now Such proceedings as these among you regular Solks who pique yourselves upon your honesty, and So Forth, have often Surprised me, who make no violent preten stons either to honesty or regularity.

For my own part, I confess I am of a different way of thinking cheating is cheating to me in every shape — I will neither smuggle nor defraud: ^
will neither purchase prohibited commo dities, nor decoy women out of they virtue by false appearances: if they an
resolved to fall, they shall fall fairly — I. I cannot look and talk them to my pur
pose— — shall be extremely out in in) reckoning, Beauford. The eyes and th(

tongue are powerful weapons when they are properly exerted against the weaker sex; and a woman of strong passions, ’ and great sensibility— — one (fashionable) word — a woman offentiment, stands but a poor chance with a man who can match her in her own Style of behaviour.’ — All these things duly considered, 1 flatter myself that I shall be successful.' That we may both be successful, in our respective manoeuvres, is the sincere wish
of.

Ay; now she is coming. I shall
make Something of her at last:.

I am right. I thought I could not be mistaken. What a dear, delicious girl she is * — But what is all this preamble about? you will Say. I will tell you my tale. My heart, indeed, exults at
t
what is past:, and my future prospects are extremely animating. — You shall hear.
Finding that one woman was coying it, I determined to make the most: of the other; and So I pushed my fortune with Lucy. — It will be needless to tell
you

no other woman at That time upon my hands, and as She was a soft, gentle thing, and really fond of me, I could not treat her with contempt. — When a woman does all fly can to oblige me, ' it is not in my nature to be cruel to her.
While I was sauntering with Lady Lucy, this morning, in the meadows,
f
She leaned upon my arm, and I played the fool with her, as one is very apt to do when one is alone with a fine shrl — ^
whom Should we meet but Clara, with

fawned upon me, and seemed to be exceedingly glad to see me.
Lady Lucy, stooping to caress hiiin, Humbled, and would have fallen down,
I believe, if I had not caught her in my arms in a tender manner, to stive her; for the fond simpleton looked full of gratitude and love. I was, therefore, difposed to say something kind to her.
By this time Clara was near enough to see what we were about. When she palled us she looked pale, and extremely agitated; yet inexpreshbly lovely.
I bowed. — She honoured me with a curtfy, though a Slight one. pleased, however, with this proof of her return ing civility at least, I turned to look. aster her. Her figure was too elegant not to fix the eye which it had attracted.
While I was gazing on her, I Saw her Sink to the ground. I ran, I flew
to

V
to raise her. She was fainting; the image of death. — I cried aloud, “Lady Lucy, Miss Wroughton is in a fit: run. Call for help.”
Lucy, frightened at the suddenness of the accident, and at the dying looks of Clara, hurried towards the house, leaving me alone with the dear, distressed creature. — Having lifted her up, and laid her head upon my bosom, I prelted her hands in mine; but finding her still insensible, I strove, by numberiefs warm kisses, to restore her to life.
At last she opened her eyes, but closed them again immediately, as if on purpose to give me full liberty to do what I pleased. I made a good use of the moments of indulgence, and not only kissed her forehead, eyes, and hair, but her charming, pouting lips, vrarm with returning life, returning love. I
F 4. kissed
104  .
kissed her till I perceived her quite recovering: and then thought it proper to deflfl, for fear of a second altercatiorir scene: : I have known a good Scolding bout Sometimes attended wsth very liberal permissions. — However, not being altogether Sure of my ground here, and being really anxious about clara’s recovery, I endeavoured to sooth her with a thousand tender speeches, and Soft pressures of her hands in mine, and by straining her with ardour to my bosom— — am sure fly was not difpleased with my fond endeavours.
After having raised her head, and disengaged herself from my arms, she thanked me for the assistance I had given her; and, looking round, ashed where Lady Lucy was.
“Pray do not let me detain you from her, ” added she.
This
 . 105
This was the very thing I wanted. —
I solemnly swore, that Lady Lucy was nothing to me; telling her, at the same time, that having been thrown from herself, by her coldness to me, I had met with Lady Lucy by accident; that I could not help speaking to a woman sometimes;; that her Ladyship had taken advantage of my politeness to her, to affect; a familiarity which was quite unnecessary, as it would never make any impression upon me, who was, and ever should be, whether she was kind or cruel to me, hers alone.
She sighed, but made no reply. Then, riling from the ground, she fufo fered me to take her arm, which I, immediately, put under mine, and in sifted upon leading her home.
While I was leading her homie, I, anxiously.. into the cause of

her sudden disorder; expressed the tendered: concern, and entreated her, with so much earnestness, to be restored to the blessings I had once enjoyed, that I believe Ihe knew not what to say to me.
Taking advantage of her silence, I repeated my request to be admitted to See her again as usnal; Swearing that I would never again abuse her kindness to me. — In short, I told her, plainly, at last, that I neither could, nor would live without her.
She then appeared to be quite sost ened, but only replied, “What will my aunt Say? ”
We had, by this time, reached the back door of Mrs. Mordenss house— — pulled out her key: I took it ' from her ♦ “Let me have this key, ” said I; “If you will be, alone, in the garden, in the evening, I will make you a

She made little or no answer: Ihe looked pale, and trembled. I folded hersh my arms. — “You are hardly recovered, my life, ” said I; “let me ga in with you.”
“No — leave me now, ” replied she, with a blush, and a tender Sigh — “leave

Lady Lucy was, indeed, at that moment, advancing towards us. — I saw her with some of the neighbouring servants whom she had met with, bringing cordials and salts“

Yet I felt fensations So exquisite ly delicious, that I cannot reflect, upon them without the highest raptures, nor can I forbear to wish for the repetition of them with the utmost impatience. — There was a something in her whole appearance, while I, under a neceshty of helping her, devoured her, unreststing, with my endearments, which charmed me beyond expreshon, and' made me fensible that I felt for her more than I ever felt for any other woman. — I

However, I would not be too prelt ing. The true voluptuary will bear the delay of his pleasure, if that delay is likely to heighten the relish of it. I, therefore, made my passion keep time with her inclination; by so doing, I gained a thousand little advantages which love prompted her to allow me, and which, had I eagerly attempted to seize before she was willing to permit them,
I might have created new suspicions in her mind. Besides, by thus playing with her, I inflamed her passions, and

j22  .
\
tended by a servant. I joined her immediately, tho’ She seemed frighted and uneasy: and by her uneasiness diminilhei the pleasure I Should have enjoyed II conversing with her.
The man kept a good way behind out of respect;; we spoke, so low thai he could not, possibly, hear what m said.
I pleaded hard to be accepted in that room of Sir Arthur. She at last owned, that, if her father would but consent, she should not hesitate a moment to prefer tne to him.
This, I thought, was a considerable point gained. My next Step was to endeavour to prevail on her to go off with me, as her father had no objection to me, as he was only scrupulous about the f breach of his promise— — father,
my dear Nancy, ” continued I, “may
make

“It is too great a risque” ” she“ “can never consent to it.”
k
“I must bid adieu, then, ” answered I, “to all felicity.”
She looked earnestly at me: fly saw
%
exceedingly affected, nd seemed to Seel for me; yet She had the resolution to say tome — “You have not well confldered, my Lord, what you have proposed to me: only take a little time to reflect. Can your Lordship really esteem, or place any confidence in, a woman, who is so lost to honour, to the decency due to her character as a woman and a daughter, as to determine shamefully to deceive her

The word artful was Spoken with particular emphasis, and accompanit with a look So strongly expreltive of h meaning, that I was charmed with h prudence, tho’ fly plunged me into d Spair by it. — I endeavoured, howeve to frame a reply Sufficient to refute h arguments, tho’ at the Same time, I real thought I was wrong in attempting

In the next place, I endeavoured to prevail on her to promise me not to marry Sir Arthur. — “You are not obliged, my dearest Miss Garlies, ” said I, “to give your hand to a man whom you do not love. — Neither duty nor honour demand Such a Sacrifice, nor ought your father ' to require it. — No father ought to require such a sacrifice from his child. By refilling Sir Arthur, therefore, my dear
Nancy, you will pave the way for my admission in his room; he will, probably, quit you in disgust, and Mr. Garlies will then, perhaps, consent to my happiness.” She Ihook her head, and begged me to leave her, as a longer conversation, if
G 3 her

her father heard of it, might be disapproved of by him.
It was with difficulty I complied; ] wiffied to gain her assent to what I had requested, but I could not get her to give me the desired satisfaction; and I confess 1 discovered great discontent at her behaviour; imagining that as I had abandoned my first scheme, which was, indeed, indefensible, she would not have scrupled to gratify me by her compliance with my second proposal.
She affected to take not the least notice of the determination I had made to forget her: and we parted with the utmost indifference on both fides. — Chagrined at my disappointment, I resolved to leave the country the next morning; but how vain are the resolves of a man desperately in love! I could not bear to go while she remained unmarried; I lingered in the

neighbourhood; sometimes Strolling to one place, sometimes to another; everywhere hearing, to my extreme disquiet, that preparations were making for the marriage between my Nancy and Sir Arthur. I, therefore, concluded that Ihe had consented to marry Coningham. Yet I could not leave the country.
My chagrin and my disquiet injured my health: I became restless, and all over disordered. My illness terminated in a fever. My servants sent for a physician,
and I grew better: yet I had not
%
left my bed when they told me, by way of affording me some amusement, that
there was to be a monthly ball the follow

Thinking, at that instant, that I Should have a good opportunity to see my Nancy, at least, once more, while she remained Miss Garlies,. I rose, and dressed
G 4 myself,
12s  .
myself, tho’ little able to endure the fatigue of putting on my clothes.
By the time I entered the assembly room I was hardly capable of supporting myself upon my legs: yet my eyes immediately went in search of Miss Garlies.
I soon discovered her; She was not more remarkable for the beauty of her person than for the melancholy which seemed to have taken entire possfession of her.
Her mother sat on one fide of her, and a young lady on the other; both of them seemed to use their utmost endeavours to rouse her from the dejection in which she was buried: she was certainly inattentive to everything about her.
Her companion, at last, pointed me out to her. She turned her languishing eyes towards me with looks in which
furprise and concern were strongly painted:.

ed: and Ihe expressed her emotions by only not ssirieking.
I saw no m6re. — The fatigue which I endured on being out of my bed, so very improperly, I must say, increased my in dispofition; and my feelings, in consequence of Miss Garliesss cruel behaviour, quite overwhelmed me; nor was I fenfi x ble of what passed, till I found myself encircled by a great number of people. Among them was my dear Nancy in a pitying attitude, her hands were clafpcd together, and her eyes fixed mournfully upon me, while tears rolled in large drops down her lovely face.
I was so much affected by her dillrefs, which was, I soon perceived, on my account, that I thought no more of my own disorder.
Just when I was beginning to address myself to her in the most tender strain,

totally regardless of the company about me, Mrs. Garlies, with a mild and com passionate voice, desired me to compos myself, and to keep myself as quiet ai possible till I could be conveyed home, as Ihe feared, that any farther exertior of my Ipirits might be attended witl disagreeable consequences.
She then turned to comfort her daiish
D
ter. — “Go and sit down, my dear, ” Said She, “my Lord is a great deal better.” Nancy Sighed as if ssie doubted liei mother’s intelligence; but Mrs. Garlics’; gentle pity, and perfuassve manner, hat the effect: which it ought to have hac upon her daughter. I myself was parti cularly touched at her maternal behaviour : I saw, at the same time, with unspeakable pleasure, that my Nancy copied her mother very exactly, and thai

in the world. — I had, however, but little time to admire them, for I was led to a carriage, and attended by a gentleman who discovered great care and politeness about me.
The next day I received inquiries after my health from Mr. and Mrs. Garlies.
In return, I examined the messenger very closely about his young lady. — He told me, that it was feared she had a disorder upon her spirits.
Thus, you see, that Garlies, rather than break his word with Sir Arthur, tho’ given before he had consulted hetj will run the risque of lossng a most amiable and dutiful child, to increase my affliction.
I know that I am, in a great measure, the cause of nancy’s indilpofition, and I will make one more effort to Save her,

Have you reflected, with a proper southeast rioufnefs, on what I wrote to you about Clara? Have you not confldered, that if you really love her, you not only injure her deeply, but destroy your own peace as well as hers, by trifling, so ridiculously
with her; by trifling in so ridiculous a manner with the girl who loves you;
with a girl whom you yourself love:, if it is possible for you to be at ail fensible of a passion so enchanting as love is under proper restrictions.

Lord BEAUFORD.
I Have just opened your letter. — Whether you will be pleased or not with my frankness, I muji tell you, that I laughed immoderately at your rejirifiions upon a passion which can never be truly — certainly not transportingly enjoyed, but when it is carried to an enthusiastic pitch. — Rejiriffions in love! — No, no, Beauford — you know nothing of the
matter. The raptures of love are only felt by such fellows as myself, who would
ill deserve them, did we Suffer ourselves to be shackled by any restraints. To

\
convince you that I am in the right, let me tell you, that no man was ever more Solidly, more Subftantially blessed than I was, last night, in the arms of Clara Wroughton, who has not only more charms, but more love than half her Sex put together. — She is a Venus: Ihe is — I will explain myself — that you may be sure I am in my sober senses, tho’ I will allow that they have been lapped in Ely sium.
You, doubtless, remember that I told you how much tender impatience Clara discovered on the evening we parted. That impatience I determined to improve to my own advantage. Accordingly, I out ftayed my time, tho’ I can scarcely describe what I felt for above half an hour.
As soon as I approached the garden door, I put my eye to the keyhole— —
fav

 . 135
saw the mistress of my soul walking up and down with hasty steps, with all the emotions of fond expectation strongly marked in her features, and indeed in every gesture.
She was, as I designed Ihe Should be, at the farther end of the walk when I put the key into the door.
Hearing me turn the key, fly redoubled her speed, and by that time I had opened the door, absolutely flew into my arms.
I had scarce time to pay her for her haste by a profuflon of kisses, ere She drew back, and, turning her blushing face aflde, said, in the most enchanting accents, “Let me go. Sir Edward; I am half angry with you.”
“For what, my life?” said I, devouring her pouting lips: “For staying so long? It was the fault of my watch, ”

added I, holding it up to her: — (I had put it back purposely“
“” cried she, trembling with
love and joy, though she affected to frown, and to be offended — “Men have alf ways excuses ready.”
“I can never want any, ” Said I, “to keep myself from all I love; but I must thank you, thank you thus — (throwing my arms round her waist, while we Sat on a little turf seat together) for the dear impatience you so kindly expressed“
“won’t be thanked;, I won’t be kissed, Stanly, ” cried she, llruggling faintly.
“As you please, Miss Wroughton, ” replied I, instantly, letting her go. — “1
did not know that we were always to h(
/
upon this formal footing.” (Rising and walking to the other fide of the garden, where there was a very convenient graft

Hope, and where, I knew, fly would follow me.)
She was, indeed, with me, in a moment; and, laying her soft white hand upon my shoulder, with the mofl: inflnu ating air, while her melting eyes, filled with an expreshve languor, were fixed on mine — “Am I no longer your Clara?’* Said she.
“When you behave like my Clara, ”, replied I, gazing on her rising bosom, which Seemed to pant to meet mine, and to heave with an undiflembled fear of having displeased me.
“What have I done?” cried she, in a plaintive tone.
“You have only been too cool and coy, ” answered I, sullenly; letting her go a second time.
“Pray who is indifferent now. ?” said file, lifting up her eyes full of tears. —
Then,

138  .
Then, leaving me, stie sat herself down upon the stope, and covered her face wdth her handkerchief.
I threw myself down by her in a moment, tore away the handkerchief which concealed her beauties, and pulled her soft, weeping face to mine.
She made an effort to prevent my eager kisses, by dropping her head upon my bosom, but I soon contrived to let her Sink down gently on the grass. — She was then too much in my power to make any great resistance: She still, however, strove to rise; crying, *‘let me go; indeed Stanly, I will not Suffer this” — tho’ 1 plainly perceived, at the Same time, thai her passion for mew^as Sufficiently violeni to make her efforts to apologise for he

 . 139
Words cannot describe her behaviour in a situation which requires, even in the most rapturous moments, the greatest delicacy, I can only say,, that she was so enchanting that she increased my love
for her, and doubled its ardour.
As soon as she recovered from the delirium of joy into which she had been
hurried, tears rushed from her eyes —
but they were not the tears of tenderness, they were the tears of shame, Ibrrow, and resentment.
She looked as if she thought it her duty to aecufe me; but. she looked asso loth to accuse me.
Just when she was going to reproach me, I stopped her with a fucceshon of Sresh transports, stifled all her complaints, and fixed her more firmly mine than ever. — Her tenderness increased every moment; but how I should have

Riling instantly, Ihe hurried me to the door, looking back at almost every step, for fear of being surprised: feeing nobody, however, she threw one arm round my neck, and pressing me to her delicious bosom, cried, with the most bewitching voice — “Come sooner tomorrow: remember I cannot live with -- out you.” Then ffiutting the door in a hurry, ffie prevented my reply.
I soon returned home, with my head and my heart full of my happiness, and sat down to communicate it to you.
And now, Beauford, you see this is the only way to be taken with a woman. I am certain I have secured to myself th( entire possession of clara’s heart ant person, who has every requisite to ia

Sir EDWARD STANLY.
I Have not been more shocked a great while than I was by the perusal of your last letter.
You have acted, Stanly, with regard to Clara, a most unkind, cruel part.
Can
142  .
Can a man who pretends to love a woman only to take advantage of her credulity, of the sincerity of her passion for him, be worthy of her tenderness? Can such a man talk, with any propriety, of delicacy? Of very little delicacy must he be Sensible who can require Such prooss of a woman’s love. What must the poor girl endure, when Ihe comes to reflect: upon your abusing her indulgence, and upon your drawing her in, by the most insamouflyartsul behaviour, to gratify your inclination at the expense of her character and her peace?
Indeed, Stanly, I feel for Miss Wroughton. With those Sentiments, do you imagine that I shall ever bring mysels to treat my dear, angelic Nancy in the Same barbarous manner? — So Sar am I disposed to treat her in that manner, were she overwhelmed with her tender
sensations,
%

 . 143
'ensations, and almost ready to grant me very favour which her beauty and my jasslon might tempt me to solicit, 1 would curb my passion, whatever it cost northeast; my respect ffiould conquer my love enough to enable me to preserve my dear sirs from falling a victim to her tender [less: a tenderness which, indulged at a proper time, would make me the happiest of men: under the sanction of decency and virtue, how enchanting does it appear?
Reflect a little, Stanly, on the treasure which you have lost: your loss is, indeed, irreparable: you ought, however, by a speedy marriage, to make miss Wroughton all the amends in your power, for having Seduced her from the paths of virtue. — How unworthily, how unlike a man of honour have you acted! To seduce a woman who had been virtuously

144  .
oully educated, and who, probabl] would not have swerved from the laudt ble principles instilled into her mind, i. you had not basely availed yourself o her fondness for you! — In how lhameft a light do you appear in my eyes! — Sine then the lovely Clara erred entirely oi your account, will not her love, will no her gratitude plead in her behalf? Thq surely ought to plead strongly in her behalf. — Pity her — pity her distressed sami ly : — confider that you are the foie cash of her distress and of theirs, and atone by a Speedy marriage — by the only way in your power — for the unmerited, and in defenlible cruelty of your behaviour. — You would have married Clara if you could not have gained your point by dishonourable proceedings; and have you not a thousand times more reason to marry her now, as she has undone herself
merely
I
 . 145
jnerely to give you pleasure?? a woman, so condescending, has a fairer claim to our protection than any other: She has indeed an indisputable right to it, by having purchased it with what is dearer to her than her life.
I have wrote to Miss Garlies, not to
%
prevail on her, a second time, to act so indiscreetly as to quit her father’s house without his consent; but only to alsure her, that I will not alk her to accept of me till I am favoured with Mr. garlies’s approbation: yet I have promised most solemnly never to marry any other woman while she remains stngle, and while there are the stightest hopes of my ever being hers.
Follow my example, Stanly, if you have any virtue left, and make haste to make that woman happy, who has sacrificed everything to give you a felicity vol. II H which

Had Clara been able to resist me, why, perhaps, merely on account of the oddity of the thing, I might have married her, as I suppose I must have an heir to my estate — but I must be mad indeed to think of marrying her now. — • Why, she cannot exist without me — the fond creature — a single moment. She has more warmth in her exprestions, more fire in her constitution than half the women in town. She is a most delicious girl, and loves me to distraction; and yet I, actually, believe, we shall quarrel.
We were on the brink of a falling out last night.
I met her, exactly at the hour appointed at her own desire; yet, because I refused to visit at the house, she wanted to make a formal affair of it; and she is still in a stately way about it, I really won

Some, indeed, make a noise, I believe, in order to persuade you that they have yielded, with the utmost reluctance, to give you a higher opinion of their modesty; others have actually pretended to be ashamed to look you in the Sace; and others, like congreve’s Doris, absolutely deny any knowledge of you, though they slept, the night besore,

by your fide. In short, there is no end to the fancies of women: they are the most capricious of beings: all of them but my Clara; my lovely Clara. She is not one of those whom 1 have been describing: : is above all disguise; she freely owns her love, and dares as freely indulge her pashon to the highest pitch;. yet with a delicacy which enhances the joy. I am half intoxicated with love and rapture. — I left her a little abruptly just to let her see I had no notion of being fooled, not even by the woman nearest my heart, but I shall fly to her again with more lively transports: transports neither to be defined nor described.

ftantly, replied, “You know. Sir Edward, that your proposals to me were not refused by my aunt, and if you choose to comply wtth them — if not — we meet no more.”
“My dear girl, ” answered I, willing to laugh her out of her strange notions,
“I really don’t understand you: what can Mrs. Morden have to do in this affair? or how can we, possibly, be happier than we are at present?” ?”
“this is your opinion. Sir Edward, ” said she, “1 am of a very different one, and, therefore, without talking any further upon this Subject:, with which 1 See, you are quite tired, I desire you will
leave me.”
“I will Sooner leave my life, ” replied I, forcibly detaining her, while she was turning to go towards the house. “I love you, at this moment, more passionately
than

Your beauty receives new lustre from those little artifices to heigh en my affection, though it is sufficiently ardent without them; and your wit grows more poignant by the variety which you throw into your conversation: : is that variety which makes you every hour a new object, and a more adorable mistress“
“Sir, ” cried ffie, pushing me back, while I strove to fix on her lips — - “Hold, Sir; it is not as a mistress I desire to please: if I am not to be looked upon as your wife. Sir Edward, we break off all connexion, as I told you before.”

“Why really now. Miss Wroughton, ” said I, horribly provoked at her still teasing me upon the same dull topic, “I cannot see any reason for onr
Separating. I came on purpose to offer you a thousand a year; and that is, I
Swear, more by five hundred, than I would give to. any other woman, though she was a thousand times shandsomer — is handsomer she can poshbly be — than yourself. — You shall have your choice of my three houses, and call that your own which you like best : you shall have a carriage.

“Infamous contract! ” answered Ihe,
“and you are still more infamous to offer it; to dare, indeed, to suppose that it could be accepted — even listened to by me: but it is all my own fault: I, I only, am to blame. — Deluded idiot, to fancy that the dear deceitful man, whom I fondly loved, was more perfect than the rest of his sex, because he was njore pleasing; that his mind was as good as his person was attracting; that his gratitude and his generostty would be equal to his tender vows, and Solemn protestations. — On your protestations, indeed,
I did not depend. — For men, I know, too often make them with a determination to prove unfaithful. — But I thought I Saw Something in you, which declared

If women knew what a confounded deal of mischief they do with their tongues, they would be more filent, perhaps, than they are. It is that cursed propensity to tattling which ruins everything.

has she proved herself by her absurd conduct? Yet it is plain she has sentiments very different from mine; for when I Sent her a note penned with the
most iinpashoned eloquence of love, in my opinion, she returned it unopened. Fretted at such an obstinate perseverance to her own as well as to my disquiet, I dispatched another letter, a longer one; in that letter I expressed my meaning more fully; but it was treated justin the same contemptuous manner: so that I see very small hopes of a reconciliation; at present, at least. By and by,

You and I, Sir George, look upon things
in a very different light, I confider Clara as a woman, who is not only the most beautiful, but the most amiable of her sex, and who has a mind replete with the most: noble sentiments; she is,

at once, generous, grateful, tender, and sincere: ftie has only rendered herself unhappy by giving happiness to her lover. Her excefsive sensibility has undone her. She loved Stanly too well to deny him anything, and she Sacrificed her reputation, and even her virtue to complete the felicity of the man on whom ftie doted. Could such a sacrifice shave been too nobly rewarded? Certainly not. Stanly ought to have made her his immediately by the most sacred ties; by marrying her he would not only have restored the tranquillity of mind, and established her character, but have secured her affection, and fixed her gratefully to himself for ever. — Clara, Sir George, is by no means a loose girl; she would not have yielded, I dare say, on any account, to any other man than him to whom she

YO U talk like a very young man,
my Lord; like a man far gone in a romantic passion which will not let you see the consequences of the measures you have taken; which will not let you be sensible of the impropriety of your marrying a woman so diftractedly fond of another man as to give up her virtue to him; for your lordship will not allow even an unusual warmth of constitution to have in the least forwarded the ruin of

her reputation. Now as things are circumstanced, I cannot possibly approve ot your alliance with her; for by marrying her you will, probably, see the fon of Sir Edward, heir to your title and estate
- — is a consideration, I imagine, not to be disregarded. — besides, you can have no rational prospect; of domestic felicity with a woman who has acted in So very indiscreet a manner, to Speak of her conduct in the mildest terms. — How will it agree with your lordstiip’s delicacy to take a woman totally attached to another, Supposing you could put up with her having So easily yielded to her Seducer? and yet I am willing to allow that miss Wroughton might have found it extremely difficult to resist the insinuating attempts of her dishonourable lover, from the natural tenderness of her
difposition, from the natural eafiness of
her
*

her temper, without having bad principles, or a corrupt heart. — She may, therefore, be jusbly deemed an object: of pity; but can you seriously think of her,, after having maturely reflected upon her behaviour, for a wife? Could you indeed, by any mode of persuaflon, prevail on Sir Edward, to make her some atoneiment for the injury he has done her, by marrying her himself, you would da a moss; laudable action: and every man of honour would •commend Sir Edward for Squaring his conduct agreeably to your advice and entreaties.. But why should you think of sharing your title, and your fortune with such a woman?
I am astonished at your having entertained the least idea of a marriage wfith her. — Doubtless, there are many women to be met with as handsome, and. as ami' ' as Miss Wroughton, infinitely mors.
I 3 amiable.

amiable, I imagine, for having had resolution enough to defend themselves against all improper attacks. The friendship and the love which you felt for miss Wroughton before her deviation from the paths of virtue, merited no censure, because she, apparently,, was entitled to all your ferifations in her favour; but if you still love her well enough to make her reparation, for the injuries she has received from Sir Edward, you should strive, I think, rather to extinguish your pashon, than to increase its flame. Sir Edward cannot, indeed, be justified, for having taken advantage of Miss wrough tonss weakness; but I shall always believe, that it is in every woman’s power to keep her lover at a proper distance, if she chufesiti and tho’ the woman who has given the strongest proofs of her discretion has the greatest reason to expect

to be honourably fettled, every man of feeling must pity her who has, with clara’s good difpofttions, experienced clara’s fate.' — Happily for her, miss Wroughton, while she deserves the compassion of both sexes, does not (land in need of pecuniary assistance from anybody. She has an ample fortune in her own hands, and has, therefore, nothing to do but to despise the man who has availed himself of her ill placed confidence in him, and to behave in so exemplary a manner for the future, as to repair all her former errors, and to convince the world, that she neither from a propensity to vice, nor from a constitutional indelicacy, gratified the wfishes of her highly favoured lover with imprudence, but that fly might have saved herself from years of remorse and contrition, if she had not, iman unguarded moment, suffered her ten

I have done my duty; wishing, therefore, that you may see things in the same light as they appear to me,
I remain.

This Clara is an absolute heroine:
a complete Lucretia. She not only peremptorily refuses to see me, but she will not receive a letter, not even a mefsage from me: nor is it poshble for me to get a sight of her anywhere. I have endeavoured to bribe her servants, in order to slip into the house to her,

but I cannot succeed; and as to meeting
^
her in any other place, I have not the smallest glimmering of a hope: because she never goes out. Upon my Soul she
keeps

 . 1b3
keeps it up gloriously; I really believe I shall marry her at last. Matrimony,
I suppose, is quite a specific in cases of this nature: and, poshbly, her behaviour is studied to oblige’ me to have recourse to it.. However, without a joke, a woman of exquisite sensibility, who denies herself the transports arising from the sight of the man she loves, after she has Surrendered to him at discretion, acts a very meritorious part. — She certainly
loves me; and it was certainly her violent
sh
love for me — a pashon not to be subdued— — threw her into my arms. — It is a pretty clear cafe too, that a strong desire to secure me to herself, fiipports her under her repeated refusals. She
must, therefore, have some virtue; that
%
is, she has a fushcient quantity of it for a mistress, but not enough for a wife: for iqose as you think, me, Harry, I
shall

i have just heard that Clara is extremely ill; her illness was to have been a great secret; but as my fellows are perpetually upon the lookout, some of
them have been informed that. she is very much out of order, yet no physician, not even an apothecary has been sent for. — I hope the dear creature is breeding, and then, if we are tacked together time enough to save her credit, I shall have an heir without any farther trouble..

Sir EDWARD STANLY.
H' O W can you be so ludicrous,; Stanly, upon so serious a subject— — you mind not what is said to you. You have ruined the character, and you have destroyed the peace of this poor girl, and now you will absolutely kill her : if she dies, I shall certainly look upon you as her murderer. You will not, indeed, be the first man who has killed his woman; you are, therefore, I suppose, very indifferent about the affair;
 , igi
fair: yet, Ned, in spite of all that laughing ease with which you affect: to treat it, you may — ay, 'and you will, one day, feel remorse for what you have done. I wish it was in your power to undo it: but, tho’ you cannot undo what you have done, you may make Clara no inconsiderable amends, by marrying her; why should you not immediately give her your hand? especially as you are really of opinion, that she yielded not from any looseness of dilpo fition, but merely from a sincere and ardent passion for you : apashon which she could not, with her utmost efforts, conceal or control: a passion which may, when she is authorised to discover it in a proper manner, render her exceedingly pleasing. I advise you to take no steps but what I would take myself were I in your situation. When a man has treated
a wot

192  .
a woman as you have treated miss Wroughton, he owes her, I think, every kind of atonement in his power.
With regard to my own affairs, I hope 1 am just on the point of being completely happy with my dearest Nancy : she has, by her admirable conduct, sained her father to our interest. I aco

quainted you, if you remember, with the letter I wrote to her, to beg her only to persist in refufmg Sir Arthur, if she thought she could not be happy with hiiti; adding, that I had no other favour to solicit, as I loved her too tenderly, and esteemed her too sincerely, to desire anything of her which might, in the slightest degree, interfere with her own happiness, strongly connected, I imagined, with her filial'duty. — Her answer was to this purpose; had I been her father’s choice, or could I have gained
his

 . 193
his approbation, she should have thought herself extremely happy; but as that could not be obtained, she was refoived to show her obedience, whatever it cost her; hoping that the consciousness of having done her duty, would reconcile her to any situation.
Tears, it seems, rolled down her dear face, while she sat writing her letter. When she had finished it, she rose to go down flairs. At that moment she beheld Mr. Garlies at the back of her chair.
“My father!” — She could say no more.
“My child! my child !” — Those were the only words which he could articulate, while he folded her, with a parental fondness, to his bosom.
She could not, at first, tell what to
think. — She trembled: she had a thou

He ashed her why she trembled, and how she could suppose it poshble for him to be offended with her, as she had just given him so strong a proof of her duty, and of her regard for him. “No, my child, ” continued he, “so striking an instance of filial duty, and felf denial, ought not only to be ‘ acknowledged,
but rewarded. I will send for Lord Beauford, and undertake, myself, to let Sir Arthur know that an alliance with him cannot be thought of.
You may imagine what transports 1 felt when the message came to me. I hastened to the house which contained the foie mistress of my heart, and received my blushing, trembling Nancy frorn her .father’s hand.

self, sometimes, Harry, to these necessary devils) and begged only to be

“I will endeavour to persuade her to accept of it, ” replied she: : “I fear all my efforts will be to no purpose, as she will soon be incapable of listening to the consolations of her friends, soon out of the reach of the malice of her enemies : she will soon be insensible to everything; she will soon be numbered among the dead.
The word dead struck me to the foul: the idea of my clara’s dying, almost deprived me of my senses: : however, Sometimes, that this girl had, perhaps, represented her friend in a worse condition than she really was, merely to terrisy me, I cried, “Dying or living, I will See her: I will make her mine in the most Solemn manner : therefore, my dear miss Melville, ” continued I, Seizing her hand, and forcibly pressing it,

“pray exert all your interest with your charming friend in my behaff, and my obligations to you will be infinite.’ ’
She struggled all the while to disengage herself from me; but ihc was, I knew, pleased in her heart, notwitfi ftanding her resistance. Did not Clara resist stoutly, and yet fall a victim, at. last, to my passion and to her own? — * Women love to be forced to act agreeably to their inclinations.
“You will never be under any obligations to me. Sir, ” said Miss Melville, craning up her pretty white neck with a disdainful air; “I, therefore, desire you to let me go. My poor, unhappy friend will soon, as I have already told you, be out of the reach of any farther

Yellerday he informed me, that, during these three or four hot days, Miss Wroughton had walked a little in the garden, about eleven o’clock; but that she had never stayed long in it, being exceedingly weak and low. I found, in short, that the dear creature had miss carried: I, therefore, began to brighten up, thinking that I had not been guilty of the mischief I had apprehended; thinking too, that what I had done might be repaired. I was only puzzled how to get into the garden: for, tho’ I kept the key, it was entirely useless; as a new lock had been put upon the door. However, I immediately removed that

She was Sitting in a green garden chair; her head rested upon her hand; her face was as pale as afties; her whole persbii wai? emaciated; and those arms, which were once So Soft, So plump, So finely fleshed, looked withered she trembled, and was Scarce able to list up her head) which drooped like a blighted lily.

Reflection was then at an end : I flew to her, and caught her, fainting as she was, in my arms, raised her out of the chair, sat down in it myself, placed her on my knees, and laid her drooping head on my bosom.
It is imposhble for me to tell you, Beauford, what I felt at that instant— —
soul was overwhelmed with tenderness, and grief. I strained her to my beating heart, and endeavoured to reanimate her languid frame by a million of impashoned kilses; and 1 swear, so ^' lemnly swear, that I felt more transporting joy from the hopes of restoring

At length she opened her eyes, which seemed, at first, opprefited with a dying languor: but as Soon as her senses returned, Ihe directed them to me with a horror which made me Shudder; and cried, as loudly as her enfeebled voice would permit her — “Good heaven! where am I! — Stanly, let me go. — How dare you to offer to repeat the cruel injury you have done me? Let me go” — (struggling“
“not struggle with me, my Clara, ” replied I, riling, and feating her gently, tenderly in the chair. “I do not mean to make any attempt at which you ought to be alarmed: my heart is but too sensibly affected with what I see you suffer: I come not to renew my

offence; I come to expiate it in the most honourable manner: I come to implore your forgiveness, to she for your dear hand, that I may make you mine by the most Sacred ties : and I Solemnly Swear, that I will Ipend my future life in giving you every proof of my tenderness and esteem in my power.”
I knelt at her feet while I spoke these words, and my hands softly detained hers : the moment I paused, she forcibly pulled them away, lifted them, with her still lovely eyes, still lovely in Ipite of the dying languor in them, and said“
“my God! this, this is too much — Teach me, merciful heaven, to shp port this severe trial.” - — Then, laying her hands on the arms of the chair, to assist her rising, she added, “Let me pass. Sir Edward; everything is at an end between us; I have been a weak,
I have

I have been a guilty creature; but, believe me, when I declare it before that Almighty Power who knows the fmce rity of my repentance, that no loose inclination ever prompted me to forget what I owed myself; and that nothing but a wish to increase your ftxicityi induced me to admit those liberties of which you cruelly availed yourself to my destruction. I have confider
ed, that compliance with your unreasonable desires would render me totally unworthy of your esteem;; esteem is the only solid foundation of love. 1 have fallen a victim to my tenderness: : will cost me my life; but I shall cheerfully resign it, as I cannot bear the thoughts of living with dishonour.”
“You shall not live with dishonour, my dearest Clara, ” cried I, eagerly, pierced to the soul by the nobleness and
purity

purity of her sentiments“ “shall be, immediately, my wife: the dear, adored mistress of my fortune, as you
I
are the unrivalled mistress of my heart. — I will fly, this instant, to procure
everything necessary for our union; I
%
will then spend every hour of my life in ftiidying to repair the rnifchiefs I have occasioned“
“Sir, ” said she., Lying her icy hand; upon mine; “no r it is all: over with me: I shall soon be no longer sensible of pleasure or pain in this world. — May all gracious God accept of my sincere penitence, and not think me undeserving of his mercy in the world to come. — I have nothing more to desire, but your immediate absence. Leave me; and, for your own sake, as well as for the sake of the next woman
whom you may wish to seduce, let me
persuade

persuade you to make no unwarrantable attempts against her virtue. The an guifti occasioned by such a behaviour cannot, pofiibly, be conceived by him who has been the cause of it. Choose rather for the object: of your pleasure those women — and you will find but too many of them — who, being habituated to such treatment, cannot be so deeply sensible of the injury offered to them. Sooner or later, believe me, you will repent of your illicit connexions you will be sorry for not having attached yourself to a woman of a differ rent way of thinking.”
With these words she attempted to walk towards the house, though her feeble limbs, and deprefsed spirits would hardly permit her— — stopped her, therefore, and entreated her, with all the tender elocution I was raafter of, to hear me, afllir
ing

ing her that her conduct, her sentiments had made a total change in mine, that her affecting condition had excited my tenderest compassion, had increased my love and esteem, the warmest love and the Smcereft esteem; that my heart was unalterably hers, and that I could never think of having a connexion with any other woman. — In short, I talked myself quite out of breath, but all to no purpose; she more than once, however, turned away her head, and wiped away her falling tears.
The noble firmness which she discovered, tho’ mingled with a tenderness almost too great to be suppressed, increased my love to a violent degree, and I could not bear the thoughts of giving her up for ever. I threw myself at her feet a second time, encircled her with my arms as she stood tottermg, and conjured

f

jured her by everything moss: dear and valuable to her to pity me, and to grant a request on which the future happiness of us both, I was certain, depended: adding, that her excellent example would have all the effect; on me stie could, pof sibly, desire, and that fiie would find in me the very man she had ever wished to
r
see me.
The latter part of that speech touched her: she fetched a deep sigh: her bosom heaved, and a shower of tears streamed from her eyes. — I entertained new hopes. I rose, and folding her in my arms, called her my life, my soul, my angel, and assured her that I should ever dote upon her for condescending to pardon me, and to receive me again into her favour.
Pushing me from her, with a strength which I little expected, she cried, “No,
Stanly;

 . 215
/
Stanly; this is the last weakness of which you will see me guilty; yet you may know by these tears which recollection forces from me, that had you regarded the woman whom you pretended to love, you liiight have been the happiest of men: but were it poshble for me to recover, I have still too much respect for my own character, sullied as it is, and too high a sense of honour, to bring to any man a tainted person, and a blasted reputation.”
“You are too severe against yourself” ” — I — You —
“No, ” ' — continued she, interrupting me, “my hiijhand shall never have it in his power to reproach me with the least impropriety in my behaviour. — I, therefore, again instst upon your leaving me. Sir Edward, ”

Grown absolutely furious by her repeated refusals, and finding myself utterly unable to prevail on her, with all the tender rhetoric to which I had recourse,
I seized her in my arms, and vowed never tolet go my hold till she consented to be my wife.
She, at first, calmly desired me to leave her, and Strove to repel me by a coolness which was, I plainly Saw, affected; but finding that nothing would do, she screamed.
I was very soon surrounded by domestics
of every kind, headed by Mrs. Morden, and Miss Melville, who order(
(
them to rescue Clara, and to turn me out of the garden.
I bade the rascals stand off, and not pr^fume to touch either me or my dearest: wise,

“I am not his wife, ” cried the dear, ftrusolino: creature, — ‘‘ I never will be

Sir Ldward, ” continued Ihe, with a
f
look inexpressibly moving; “let me entreat you to leave me, it is my final re quefi:. — IHAVE not a great while to live, let me have no reason to complain of you in my last moments.”
%
A heavy sigh followed these words caused by a difficulty of breathing.
Mrs. Morden, and Lmma, both ex
%
claimed, “Oh! God! she is dying.”
I still supported her, tho’ the servants crowded round us to take her from me.
I
Again turning to me, she said, in faltering accents — “Lor the love of heaven leave me, Stanly.” — She then,
after a solemn pause, which shook my

whole frame, added, ‘‘ Farewell for ever.”
%
Mrs. Morden was, by this time, clinging to her, and pressing her to let them carry her in.
“It is no matter, ” answered ffie, “since it happens so, let him see me die: it may have a good effect: : — pray God it may; ’* — (lifting up her poor emaciated hands.)
/
Then, sailing on Mrs. morden’s neck, ffie cried, “Forgive me my dear, much loved aunt, for all my pass errors; you have been the tenderest of friends to me; forgive me. — Pray to all merciful God to forgive me. — Forget me, if possible.” Mrs. Morden could only reply with her sobs, and her tears.
“Now lay me on the ground, ” said the dying angel; “’twas here. I fell froiu virtue; here I am punished for my pre fumptiom — Do you, my dear Emma —
though

tho’ you want not such an example — do you take warning by me. — The woman who thinks herself the most virtuous of her sex, and who presumes upon her own strength, may, by granting the man whom she fondly loves, improper — tho’
seemingly trifling — liberties — be led into a situation which she can never remember without horror and shame. — Never put yourself into any man’s power, nor let any man wish to try the woman whom he intends to marry.”
While she was speaking those words,
Mrs. Morden and Emma, in the midst
✓
of their lamentings, entreated her earnestly not to talk: entreated her to endeavour to compose herself; especially the former, who sat down on the grass by her. — On Mrs. morden’s bosom, she, in a few moments, without a groan, expired.

With my hands clasped, with my heart agonised, I stood gazing on the poor departed object: of my fondest love — I would have approached, and knelt before her, but Mrs. Morden cried, O let not that wretch come near my dear child, whom he has killed: take him away; he is the cruellest of murderers.”
I felt myself, indeed, a barbarous af faftin, and suffered the fellows, who advanced at the command of their mistress, to conduct me to the fatal door which I had entered for the destruction of innocence; yet I still lingered for another last look.
When I got into the meadow — when they had shut the door against me, I, felt my brain turn round; and I believe I should instantly have thrown myself into the Thames had not my servant, having heard of the dreadful confusion occasioned
by

by at Mrs. morden’s, waited for me, and forcibly dragged me home. — But the horror of my situation can never be described— — faithful servant has never left me since; he watches me with * the affectionate attention of a relation. — I do not deserve his care, I deserve no human creature’s notice. However, as I am going to try to lose all remembrance of myself, if poftible, in another climate, I bid you farewell — perhaps — as my poor girl said to me — for ever. Words are too weak, Beauford, to express my feelings; but this I know, had I millions, I would part with them, joyfully, to recall what is pass. — Situated as I am, and while I have the least sensibility, wretchedness must be my lot.

May every woman whose passion for her lover is equal to that which my dear lost girl felt for me, be afraid to say to herself— — “far will I indulge the man of my heart, but no farther, till I can indulge all his wishes with honour.” — Clara had many virtues; she had but one failing.: that failing was her intense affection for
Your ever wretched friend,
