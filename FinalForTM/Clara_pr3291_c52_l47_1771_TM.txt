'A T length, my friend, the day d. X arrived, which Sir Charles Said. / would malce him the happiesl of hui

man race. Vain words! Is it for ' mortals to exped happiness here? I too flattered myself I Should have tailed of the cup of pure and unmixed felicity, by rendering the worthiest of his Sex happy, as I was bound to do

(
Sir Charles had, in imagination; lived over ages of refined delight with his Clara. He had given up the gay, licentious world, to which he was for merly but too much attached, for a Scheme of pure and rational pleasure,
V
not secluded from the world, but
M
mingling with it in every innocent
/
amusement; but not, like the gener'

rality of the gay and fashionable, seek
/
; foreign joys and foreign pleasures, and Shunning the only place where, true joy is to be found. He Seemed,
f
indeed, to think he Should be So at
4
tached to his Clara, as to wish to give
r 74)
tfp ail the world for her alone, and
'\
only feared I would not make the? Same Sacrifice for him, With Such
flattering profpesis was I deluded to
\
the brink of a precipice, from which I fell, and dashed my hopes to pieces.

My dear, and ever dear Sir Charles' Game early on tuesday morning to attend, to condud his Clara to S -- -- -- -- -- -,
%
and, he hoped, to happiness. We had ■ dined and spent the evening with Mrs. Fane. She promised to be punsiual to her hour on Tuesday, and Said Sir Charles resented her late disappoint = so much, She believed he was ’
V
going to S’ — — to be married., The
( n)
colour on my cheeks told her too plainly She was not mistaken. She whispered Sir Charles, She could now, ^ indeed, forgive his petulance, and would, for Mr. fane’s sake be exast * tomorrow, as she did not doubt but he would revenge it on him, as he could not well challenge her. Sir
Charles fussered her to rally him as
* •
much as She pleased, and only prayed her not again to put his patience to So < Severe a trial. But, alas! his trial was' not to come from that quarter:.
I
'I'he good Lady Worthy, his mother,, had been long ill, and though the Doctors gave him hopes, he feared
much She would not recover. Hi(

with the news that she was fpeechlessj

and would probably be dead before
he could reach D -- -- -- --, though but a
Short mile distant.
I
Never was Son more warmly attached, or with more reason, to a mother. Lady Worthy had pasfed
through life with universal approba,,

had performed all the Social and rela

to fiy all in ail, like a chrilliari; and
had been So happy as to perform them

for persons deserving of her esteem, and who returned the favour with an equal portion of that refped and reverence So juslly due to her. — Her,,

health would not allow her to think of being present at Sir charles’s nuptials;
i
but they had the sanction of her approbation.

It is imposiible for me to give any

adequate defeription of the grief an’d despair of Sir Charles on this occasion. The loss of an amiable and worthy friend and mother, though long cx;

I

delay pf a single day with tolerable pa tience. He must now even be deprived of the company and conversation ..of his Clara for some days, appropriated to mourning.
'• \
It would be a ridiculous afsesiatioii. to say, I was not fensibly touched with the disappointment. I had none

T Told my dear Amelia, that our journey was interrupted by the arrival of a mesfenger to inform Sir * Charles of, his mother’s being at the
point of death. He found her fpeechr ' less, and in her last moments; a melancholy
reverse to a man, who hoped to be a bridegroom before the next

paid the last tribute. — Yet he did not neglesl his Clara: he wrote every day, in the tendered manner, to inquire for her, and asture heros his regret at the cruel separation, and even once carac incognito to pay his duty, as be called it, to his love. He had previously acquainted me with his intention, and begged I might be alone. You may
believe I could not refufehim. We

Spent two hours in the mod tender and
rapturous manner, and renewed our

\
There was Something awful beyond
description (at least it appeared foto

me) in the presence of my lover. His melancholy spread a softness over his
countenance, which gave it an ineffable

sweetness; but he appeared to my eyes like an inhabitant of another world Whether it was the gloom of melan

I thought I found a similarity of sentiments. He listened to my tale of Sorrow. He pitied me. He adrnired — ■ angels might have admired — the sentiments and expressions of Sir Charles.

\
My heart, prone to, or rather made

up of tenderness. Seldom found an ob jeh to waste it on. Philemon was lovely; had all the arts of perfualion* He had wit. He xould allume the charasler of virtue; He could asfume

Ah! my dear Amelia, how many exult in the posseffion of virtue, who. have not half so much as the Self condemned Clara. She too might asfume the Semblance. Her lover durft not betray her Secret. But her mind is above the appearance, where She thinks the reality exists not.

Sure all man and womankind owe

Ti /jt Y dear Amelia reminds me of
my promise, and of the period at which I left Sir Charles Worthy, to

digress for one whom she would have me forget. It were well if it were postible; but everything in nature forbids.it. — But I will proceed. As Soon as Sir Charles had performed the lall office to the best of women, he flew to his Clara. He did not appear gay. It had been out of charac

demanded a slight degree of melancholy, and he paid the tribute; but • it was mixed with complacency, and,
as I said above, almost; with cheerfulness. His attention to me, far from

A lover of .a less generous „way of thinking would have Set little value on
t
Such a confession, at a time when I was ready to accompany him to the
altar. But Sir Charles Seemed to Seek

occasions of being grateful to his Clara, ’ to make her forget how much She owed to him. That, indeed, was imposeble';

It was, he Said, indeed a presumptuous one; but his Clara was all goodness and forgiveness. She must pity his passion, the most ardent that ever
glowed in the breast of man; and She must consider the cruel disappointment which had dashed his hopes, at a time when he thought himself out of the power of fate. Need I tell my

I am Sure she would not; She ever wished me united to my Clara.

„ me to interrupt or deny him, till he

He Said much more — that as lie could not live without feeing me, K and hoped I did not wish to deprive V him of that happiness, it would be more for my honour to consent to y tie the indissoiuble knot, on our arrival in London, and that a few months - would convince the world of the ardour, and Sincerity of his pasiion. He knew. too well, that I had heard many things. to his disadvantage respedins womem

which made him the more earnest in
\
this requesf. He had besides, heard,
that it was reported he only trifled with
)
me, and Some ladies affirmed it never
i
would be a match. “He that had
had So many affairs of gallantry with
\
women, his equals at leaf!, to be So taken with a little inexperienced girl, without guardians, almost her own pro tebor, and of an uncertain, and Some Said no fortune! All the world would
N
laugh at Sir Charles. He that might have had Such matches! But it was absolutely impoffible.’*
Much of this had reached Sir Charles's ears, though I was a Stranger
to it. He had conffantlv avowed his
t
, $
( 125)
honourable intentions, and Spoke in Such a Strain as might have convinced the world of his Sincerity. But malice is not easily convinced. I Should leather Say envy; malice they could not have from any other Source? I was then,
« t
indeed, too juslly entitled to their envy,
but Soon to be the objed of universal

Cruel vicisiitude! Fatal reverie
of fortune! But it was my unhappy
fate ever to be within view of hap

and then to be deprived of it.
/'
I was unable to answer Sir Charles for sometime. He held my hand to
I
his bosom, and begged my consent, or to let him interpret my Silence as a consent to his proposal. I was obliged
(
()
to Speak, lest he Should - Said, '
f
interpret my Silence in his favour. I found it hard, indeed, to refuse him anything; but, at the same time, thought there was an impropriety iri his request' ' was convinced he thought So too by the many arguments he used to persuade me to it. I told him my opinion. He Said, whatever impropriety there might be in his urging me to consent to a private marriage,
it was to avoid more disagree
/
circumstances, that might postibly
I.
attend delaying our union.
t
He Said everything that his passion or his wit could suggest, and prevailed
So far, that I promised Him an answer

m a few days; but insifted on* his not pressing me any farther at that time on the fubjefl. ‘ He, with his usual goodness and complaisance, desisted, as he' saw it gave me pain, but begged I would remember my promise, and that the day might be Soon, as he

TETTER XVII
T Am hastening, my Amelia, to a period, which I once thought the moil dreadful of my life. I idly imagined at that time, it was out of the power of fate to afflid me more severely, and that adverse fortune had emptied all her quivers in my bosbm. Perhaps I am still to endure more exquisite woes. Perhaps the measure
of my fusferings is not yet full. Shall

All Fidelia jcould do She did; all that mortal could do. She Showed her own virtue and
amiableness of heart; but even friendship and virtue cannot conquer fate. They cannot persuade me Philemon is
