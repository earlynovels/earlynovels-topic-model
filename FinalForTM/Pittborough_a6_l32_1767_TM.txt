I am at present a stranger to all those gay flattering scenes my foolish heart • has so long panted after. But is not the hour of my introduction at hand? I have pre determined to remit you whole volumes in their praise, provided they answer my high raifed expectations.
I will acknowledge to you, that the town in itself is far from making the most agreeable appearance, unless one was capable of admiring things for being merely preposterous : the height of the houses, the dirtofthe streets, and extent of the buildings. Severally coming under that denomination.
But, giddy creature that I am, why do I thus Suffer my vivacity to transport me beyond myself? and neglect telling you in its due, consequently the first place, what unspeakable regret I Seel at being Separated at So unmercisul a distance from my beloved Sister and most engaging companion : yet why may not Sober truths be

Never did honest dame Nature produce greater contrasts than you and I : light and (hade, earth and air, are but weak emblems: — we have our opposite views, our opposite arts of pleasing, our opposite difposttioned admirers. Yet notwithstanding all these opposite articles, including at the same time our tastes and inclinations we are most indissolubly attached to each other by affection’s tie, infinitely stronger
than that twig consanguinity.
\
By the way, it appears to me, from the little observation I have hitherto been ca pable of making with respect to the conduct and conversation of our numerous
''
visitants, that the nearest and dearest relationships are considered as a mere farce in this polite part of the globe.

You may hear one woman traduce another, with all the virulence, to use a masculine phrase, of her Sex. — A man (with such rancour as no exprestions can give you an idea of) shall professedly prosecute
and persecute his congenial mortal;

yet should you inquire into the merits of either the male or female cause, or the parties connexions, twenty to one but • you Sound the provocation a trifle, and the traduced and prosecuted wretch, the father, brother, .Sister, or mother of the traducer and prosecutor: who, upon such an occasion (a stranger in particular), could forbear crying out, oh! oh! these are persons among whom I must be greatly upon my guard; for if they are capable of treating their own flesh and blood so mercilessly, what have not I to apprehend?

Methinks it is pity though to renounce the little prim air I was wont to assume— — thousand pounds would, indeed, have enabled as well as authorised me to flutter before this late period, had not our prudent mother (perceiving the wild bent, I presume, of her younger daughter’s inclination) intended our quaker like appearance for a curb bridle : — but here am I a living proof how little internals are affe^ ed by externals.

when life was in its gayest prime, except, indeed, a grand annual excursion to our neighbouring city; from whence, as I have been informed, they constantly re,, rather disgusted than amused. — Is it possible, Nancy, that I derived my origin from such a pair?

You remember De la fontaine’s Shepherd. — I shall only reverse the Scene. He, upon receiving disgust at court, most pathetically welcomes his rustic garb, that had been exchanged by his prince for a pompous robe : but it is my intention to

Now I am reduced to your level, pray observe the change — the play, why, ah! it was a good one; for shakespear was the author.
Of all the bubbles mankind are exposed to, none can exceed that bubble, education. A blockhead, if he has the misfor tune to be born a lord, for example; (scandalum magnatum, out of the question; for I believe no one will prove So hardy as to deny but lords may be blockheads now and then), how unmercifully is he doomed to be’flogged from one class to another, in

A house maid (it is a rude kind of simile, but some of Mr. bayes’s will keep it in countenance), when sbe lights her fire, if, with more frugality than prudence, sbe has hastily extinguisbed the astisting 'tallow taper, and perceives but here and there a feeble spark j puffs, puffs with a light cautious hand, conscious how fatal even one rough blast would prove: but when sbe finds the blaze has kindly communicated itself around, and that not only the lesser but greater combustibles yield to its genial power; sbe sings, or william’s Ghost, or Chevy chase; and
blows it soon into a flame.

Nay, so powerful vsras the genuine dictates of my uncorrected nature, that I was frequently lost to my companions, myself, and all the world, until I had the mortification of being awakened from the pleasing delusion by bursts of laughter, frivolous chat, or undue admiration of the quick

It was well ‘for me that my heart was not equally exposed to view with my too refractory eyes; — I had been undone for a fine lady, maugre all my efforts : -- - for I know not why it was; but a pleasing kind of melancholy prevailed over even vanity itself, and involuntarily led me to draw a parallel between human transactions, and the fiction that then engaged my attention. — O lise 1 what art thou (whispered a mental Something I was till that time utterly unacquainted with) but one continued Succelfion of false representations— — Sweat, and fret, and labour, to Support some character that strikes our Sancy, or with or contrary to our natural bent — no

Colonel Dingley to Mr. Brooksbank.
'I' Have news for you, Ned, that will X greatly Surprise you; and procure you a laugh, though at your friend’s expense. I acknowledge the justice of your mirth; I anticipate your raillery; and, notwithstanding the awkward figure I am sensible a man makes when he betrays his owa infirmities, I will for once be beforehand with a busy tattling world, and inform you — of what it would be impolsble to conceal.
i
I hope you will, however, believe that it was no common means that could Subdue my boasted indifference. — No, I have a thousand times convinced you that I was

proof against the blaze of beauty, the glare

of wit, and the most striking graces of personal accomplisbments. — It was, indeed, a charm Superior to all these that insensibly Spread its influence over my heart j nor had
t
I the least intimation of the buflnefs, until it was perfectly accomplistied.
tf
Oh! Why will that lovely sex labour to render theinfelves unamiable? — Why the studied step, the artful smile, the Superfluity of ornaments? when they only undo the most finistied work of nature, and Substitute a blemisti for perfection.
♦
Some hours leisure, and the appearance of Garrick in the character of Richard, induced me to engage a Solitary place in the side box, that I might indulge myself free from all that impertinent interruption a party is too liable to produce.
As my Servant had received due orders
for his conducts I drank my coffee with

great deliberation, and only reached the house a few minutes before the perform
%
began.
On entering the box, I was a little disconcerted to find that my indolence had occasioned my fervant’s mixing with an elegant Set of company, whose conversation would have been highly grateful to me; amongst the number of which was Mrs. Hutchens, and a young lady, whose face I was well convinced had never before made a public appearance.
A
From a piece of good breeding, ' that did violence to my inclination, I would have declined taking the place my Servant had provided j it was in the front row; — and there were Several ladies to demand their preference: — • but by a then pleasing obstinacy, the dear creatures are too apt to affect on many unpleasing occasions, I found myself compelled to accept it; and in the Same instant was sensible of the
hap

happiness it procured me, by placing me next the lovely stranger.
k
Never did I behold so intelligent a
countenance; her eyes, her mouth, her every feature, conveyed — but I will not attempt to describe the innocence, the benevolence, that evidently appeared in her whole composition. — You must See her, and judge for yourself— — as there is danger in the encounter, I will not hastily expose you to it.
I was no less astonistied at the polite .ease with which my fair companion received my first compliment, than .struck by her person, and as we soon entered into general chat, I had an opportunity of remarking, that her observations had the beauty of propriety and originality; her questions the force of judgement, and her language the utmost refinement.

iwilh, my dear sister, that like the travelled pigeon, you may not Soon repent quitting your peaceful happy home: dangers, disasters, innumerable await you; and many schoolboys, perhaps, already Suspend a fatal fling to wound, at leasts your repose.
With what unspeakable rapture Shall I receive you once more into our innocent retreat, if you should be so fortunate as to

Your first letter is a too just emblem of your heart, warm, inconstant, vain. — How do you neglect the purpose of your being, and abuse one of the best of understandings! and with endowments that would enable you to stiine, on every benevolent, every rational occasion, aim at no higher excellence, than the taudry trim that fastiion can bestow.
You, my dear, are an incontestable in
«
that vanity is far from being the product of any particular Soil: had you been bred in the gay metropolis from your earliest insancy, you could not have been a more finished coquet; nor would your Simple misjudging heart have felt a stronger flutter at a beau.
And stiall it be said that my Sister, whose education has been most unexcep tionably delicate and prudent — who has not only received the clearest definition of propriety and decorum, but has been carefully
 7
fully instructed in every religious duty : — stiall it be Said, that stie, taken by the eye and the ear, fancy, idle degenerate fancy, her supreme judge and monitor — suffered her inclinations to be enslaved by the empty charms of the martial strut, and rnartial habiliments!
I stiall never forgive myself for promoting this journey, if an improper connexion stiould be the consequence; but it has ever been my weakness to give you, at all times, and upon all occasions, the preference. I, in many degrees your Superior, in the article of gravity at least, stiould have been in no danger from Such ' an excursion; as I stiould have played a timorous, cautious, and conseqilently Sure card : for.

Excuse me, but this is not the only circumstance I lament: — and can you, v.^ho have ever piqued yourself upon your Spirit and resolution, tamely Submit to be fasbion led : even beyond what is consistent either with decency, or your own private taste? Is it not a Severe reflection upon your boasled firmness, to want courage to go hand in hand with propriety? at the Same time that your attempt to exculpate yourself, by charging tiie whole blame upon the sasbion mongers (as you gaily style the original inventors), justly exposes you to the imputation of mean ness. Isbey indeed Spread the Snare; but they cannot force or surprise you into it ^ J as they have no power over your judgement, or inclination. 7'liey cannot render folly other than Solly; and though the general practice may familiarise it, in Some degree, and lessen what is preposterous, its' unsuitableness and pernicious tendency will ever remain.

But, my dear sister. Sit loose I beseech you to every flattering insinuation. — It is innocence and good-humour that enlightens. your countenance; deprive yourself of them, and even your plain faced sister may pretend to vie with you. However weak the conseflion, I myself have frequently been delighted to trace the gaiety of your heart in every speaking feature; and when I thought it my duty to chide you for

Bless met what a frightful picture have you drawn of the dear world,, and dearer worldlings. How prettily we can prattle about we know not what,, mere bugbears of the imagination: that envy, hatred, and malice, those characteristics of ancient virginity, should ever find a place in your heart. “The men callous, impatient, enterprizing, revengeful — I must laugh in your honest face.

The colonel calls it ridiculous, a disgrace to the masculine character; — but I say no: it is for tfie emolument of the women, as it prevents all that terror and apprehension we country girls especially, were wont to feel at the sight of a male mortal: but Purely, I add upon these occasions, times must be greatly changed, or my mama would never have cautioned me to be so much upon my guard, with respect to Such a species.
The colonel lives with us, I think; appears perfectly at my devotion; and, Shall I confess it, in Spite of all your wife, sober

Do not look so grave upon the occasion; I will neither play the fool, nor the madwoman: : — who can relist the natural curiosity of finding Out a' man’s heart? in common cafes, I grant you, impossibilities are no eligible attempt; but here
you must excuse me, indeed you must. —

But how can you? Why there again. How often must I repeat, that it is not in. the nature of things to be able to judge of inclinations we have never felt: -^ sono more of that, my good sage sister.
The colonel is the youngest of general dingley’s fons; he is possessed of a fine fortune bestowed upon him when a boy, by a distant relation, whose namesake he happened to be. — His age is a very pretty Suitable age for a damfelof eighteen, as I apprehend

He is a good fi, ze, neither too tall, too short, too fat, or too lean; — his complexion florid — his eyes penetrating — his mouth pleasing, and his teeth but one degree inferior to your own : add to which, an insinuating manner, a manly address, a well cadenced voice, and a happy flow of expression; and you have the whole mortal at once complete.

LETTER VII
Colonel Dingley to Mr. Brooksbank.
Your friemlly impatience to be informed of my success in my amour shall be gratified. O Ned! I blush to acknowledge it, but this seeming innocent, this child of nature, proves a very tartar.
I cannot give you an indea of the Scurvy
treatment I am obliged to Submit to — but
I must make a virtue of necessity; for I
find it would cost me dearer to reiinquisb
her, than to Suffer myself, loaded as i am
^ 0
with chains, to grace her triumph.
I
wheresoever stie appears, she commands admiration; her person is irresistible

6o
ble; whilst modesty, candour, humanity, and sweetness, evidently Shine forth h every action : but, conscious of her owi power, and naturally inclined to play the giddy humourist, though sly communicates delight to every other person thal addresses her, sbe cruelly contrives to torture me. We have now been acquainted a whole month, not a day of which (nor without unspeakable reluctance an hour) but I have Spent part of it with her. In general conversation, none can excel her, but a tete a tete sbews her to the best advantage.
How have I been charmed with the Sentiments that have flowed from her lips in her Serious reflecting moments.
Once, in particular, fly was So perfectly the woman I could wish her, that I was drawn in to make a sbber, unornamented declaration of my tender attachment to her j and depending upon the goodness of
her
 i
her understanding; and, as it proved, with
equal wisdom upon my own rhetoric, at
\
to convince her, that the indulgence of the only foible I can discover in her whole composition, would be productive of very unpleasing consequences.
She Seemed attentive — the flattery was was too intoxicating for human nature to Support. — I presumed to take her hand, pressed it with a Similar degree of rapture, that glowed in my heart — and, I believe, was half frantic in my professions of love and gratitude — when suddenly stie let me down with such precipitation that I verily concluded I stiould never have recovered myself. I would not again feel what I did upon that occasion, from a consciousness of the point of ridicule I must appear in, and the disappointment of all my pleasing hopes, for a diadem.
I do suppose my visible mortification and chagrin, gave no Small pleasure to her
vanity,.
/
6z
vanity; and whether her good nature, ot fly vivacity, was predominant, I will not take upon me to determine; but in the midst of a thousand heroic resolutions of renouncing Such vilebondage, never beholding her more, cc. fly most invitingly extended that very hand I had So fondly floated on, and with an affectation of sorrow for having offended, that communicated the utmost joy to my heart, begged me to forgive and forget the Solly fly hat practised,
_ ^ _
What partj Ned, would you hav( acted under Such trying circumstances i widely different to mine, I dare believe. my very Soul was harmonised — it was n( time for dissimulation;; time for difcre
I ^
tion : I threw myself, therefore, entireh into her power, crying out, “this is too “too great condefcension; I amover pai( “for all the mortification you have givei “me; — but do not use me the worse so “finding me so devoted to you, that.
“at

“am incapable of having any will but “yours.”
Good Mrs. Hutchens dropped in at this instant; I had not only obtained her
0
permission to pay my addresses to her charming niece, but stie was pleased to honour me with her highest approbation. She perceived the happiness that warmed my heart, in my every feature; and imagining stie should serve us both, by forwarding our attachment, would have bestowed Miss Pittborough upon me in form, with a view, as I apprehend, no less to demonstrate her good liking of your friend, than prevent that volatile lady from looking any farther for an admirer : but notwithstanding I flattered myself I had some little reason to expect such a mark of her esteem would not have been reluctantly granted, sbe had the dexterity to evade the proposition, to her aunt’s entire Satis
9
faction; and on my lifting up my eyes, by an involuntary impulse of discontent,
gave
64
gave me a look that immediately reduced me to order.,,.
f
Where, Ned, is our boasted Superiority? — where our firmness? when we car Suffer ourselves to be So wantonly playei upon are we only valiant, like the worl of cowards, where we are sensible ou power is despotic? — and shall the woman whose confidence in our honour has in duced to place her whole happiness in ou hands, alone experience the complicatei ungenerous weight of our perverse inch nations? I am resolved not to act So unworthy a part -- my tenderness, my com
plaisance (if ever I do become a husband
/
shall remain in full vigour, in spite of th matrimonial privilege, and whatever abate ment my love might receive from time an long acquaintance — should add proper tionable increase to those other feelings.
And should I even find myself deceive in the object of my choice, and that moi

than half her perfections were the result of that natural artifice, an endeavour to recommend herself to the heart of a man she approved, or, as too frequently is the cafe, merely the creation of my heated brain, my complaisance should restrain me from betraying the ungrateful discovery, my tenderness cast the veil of friendly toleration over the common infirmities of
\
humanity; — thus converting the lover into the kind companion, and considerate friend, had I not an illiberal or illiterate mind to deal with, I should reap Such happy consequences from my conduct, as would leave neither of us reason to repent our union.
But if heaven has reserved So great a blefiing for me as this lady’s hand, I shall ■ no opportunity of convincing you of the Sincerity of my prudent resolves, as all our life would be a Scene of love.

Fresh cause sbr uneafiness from every quarter! miss Kitty Hutchens is at length returned from her Hamplliire excursion; and my mistress is again playing off her torturing fancies.
'You know miss Hutchens was never a favourite with me; her person, her mind, are equal impediments : and I now fear I Shall have less reason than ever to be fond of her company.
There cannot be greater contrasts than these relations; the one is a coquet by nature, the other from playfulness and innocent vivacity.

With respect: to her 'own Sex, She is compasSionate, benevolent, and Sincere: — is any one deformed in person, She is Sure of her favour and countenance j — dejected in mind, or difeased in body, her Sympathy is ever theirs; — is their character attacked, she is 'their infallible advocate; — are they distressed in their circumstances, her purse and heart is open for their relief: — yet, too giddy for reflection, sbe frequently incurs the censure of the malevolent; — too honest for de ceit, sbe becomes an easy dupe to the deceiver; — and naturally fond of every spe cies of raillery, where the object isjusti

stable, she gives continual offence to the vain and affected, who retain a malicious imprestion of that Severity that has wounded without amending them, and has long Since been forgotten with the occasion, by the agreeable raillier.
I v»rill not display the opposite inclinations of her unamiable cousin j stie is at present Sufficiently mortified to Secure her from my Satire; bursting with envy at that Superiority that her self approbation and vanity would, but cannot, secure her from being sensible of, (he industrioufiy labours to improve every little giddy opportunity of condemning and ridiculing her lovely visitant; but the attempt is so evidently incited by the worst of passions, that it ever fails of fuccess, and only increases her own dissatisfaction and torture.
T must acknowledge that there is one part of miss pittborough’s conduct: that lies too open to miss kitty’s ill natured
attacks,

attacks, and occasions me unspeakable uneasiness— — will not conceal it from you — one blemish, amongst: so many perfections, ought not to be wondered at; notwithstanding it is of such a nature as to cast an appearance of impropriety upon actions that are in themselves both unexceptionable and innocent.
Lively to excess, and perfectly undesigning. She Suffers herself to be amused with the conversation of Such beings, as from their insignificance, or felf confe quence, are highly contemptible; — a Superannuated beau, a military coxcomb, a fribble of whatever denomination, or a hard mouthed student, are sure to obtain a distinction and attention with her; that, however flattering to them, is by no means a credit to her fine understanding.
The gouty Sir Matthew sanxsey is at present her reigning favourite; — he ogles her, with indefatigable industry, through

his frefli wiped Spectacles, gives her every advantage at cards, is eternally of her opinion; and, could he but throw aside his crutches, I dare believe would become my competitor for her hand at the ensuing ridotto.
. She appears delighted with his parade and assiduity— — upon him with the utmost complacence — Suffers him to press her hand,, with antiquated gallantry, each time he presents her the cards j — and, in Short, it is but Seldom that I can obtain a single glance. I am not So absurd as to be dissatisfied with her behaviour from conceiving she has any meaning in it; but as it deprives me of the pleasure I was accustomed to enjoy, of entertaining her without the interruption of an impertinent, I own it Sets very uneasy upon me: add to which, it lays me under the disagreeable necefiity of paying some civil attention to the equally neglected Kitty:
it has been my misfortune, ever Since I
was

vvas acquainted with that lady, to be favoured with no inconsiderable Share of her approbation, when the Smartest beau she
can pick up; otherwise I am totally neg

“a philosopher and a Soldier, what con“ “? — and with Such a fet of “features too, as utterly discountenance “the absurdity.” — This may serve as a Specimen of her happy talent for raillery — her expressions are, indeed, common place — her observations trite and despicable.
Mrs. Hutchens has been Somewhat in disposed for these few days past; so that we have seen but little company, except the gouty baronet. Miss Pittborough affects a reserve that gives me no Small pain — is less flighty than usual. — I in vain watch for a stngle look; stie bestows not one upon me; and as for a moment’s conf

She, indeed, condescends to give my aunt’s opinion a patient hearing; but makes no Scruple to distent from itj or even ridicule it, where it is So unhappy as lo meet with her disapprobation.
But, perhaps, I am premature in my judgement: there are a people upon earth who improve on acquaintance; I Sincerely wisti it may be the case in this instance; but my antipathy is uncommonly strong, and as uncommonly unaccountable.

I Observed in my last epistle, with a great degree of Sagacity, what extraordinary effects different air is wont to produce upon the constitution. The purity, Serenity, yet brifkness, of our village breezes, was ever communicating the rude glow of health to one’s cheek, hurrying one’s blood with rustic rapidity through one’s veins: — yet inspiring one’s heart with only the mildest, meekest, and most gentle sensations: to ramble an infinite extent of green fields — to behold prospects beyond the aching eye’s termination — to mix with four footed beasts — hnd listen to the half torn throats of silly

For example, a ridotto — what proves the dirty composition of this human part of ours, equal to that drooping weariness that involuntarily steals upon us, in spite of all our efforts, even when sparkling at that elegant, that well regulated assembly— — music insensibly loses its charms — our feet refuse to perform their office; — and the Sober hour of five in the morning finds our eyes above three parts closed.

indeed, niy dear sister, you are greatly mistaken in your opinion of my heart;
t
pity is a request I never yet denied the unhappy; and unhappy I must confider you in the most comprehensive sense of the word.
Providence has been peculiarly gracious to you ever Since the first instant, of your existence : — you had the best of mothers continued to you so long as her care was essential to your well doing : — you have ever enjoyed an uninterrupted stiare of health, contentment, and reputation nor need you have one wish ungratified, if

you could but once persuade yourself not to suffer them to exceed the bounds of reason and propriety.
t
\
But all these blestings which thousands vainly sigh for, are not only totally disregarded by you, but madly thrown away — whilst error alone has the direction of your pursuits; and mortification, instead of promised pleasure, becomes the Sruits of your labour.
How grating must it be to sensibility like yours, to Seel the honest reproaches your heart undoubtedly Suggests to you — to See yoursels in the odious, though just light of an ungrateful, giddy, misjudging being, hurried on by a fatal levity into improprieties, that your very nature is repugnant to, yet restrained by a false, a contemptible pride, from making an honourable retreat.
vol. I. I I have

I
114
I have no quarrel with you, my good girl, for being Subject: to follies and vanities; but for tamely suffering your whole life, happiness, and fame, to become a prey to them. The first: is your misfortune, the Second your highest fault.
Was you less capable of conquering your perverse inclinations, had you never been taught to distinguish between right and wrong, or never amiably and voluntarily rejected the, former, and adopted the latter for your rule of action (except when you indulged a few idle sallies, that by having no particular aim, could be productive of no bad consequence) I should address you in very difserent terms; and, instead of awakening reflections, you would receive my most friendly advice, and strongest admonitions : — but how absurd we should deem an unlearned peasant, whose vanity stiould incite him to preach to a learned congregation, is a question that requires no Solution.

Return, O return to propriety and peace! for they canned be separated: : the greatness of your Soul by acknowledging a due sense pf lately practised folly; and once more re eftablilh yourself in the heart you love.
N
Believe me, it is not an antiquated principle, that kindness stiould result from affection, or that esteem can peristi, without involving tenderness in the same ruin. The conflict may be severe; but too fre ' quent repetitions of ill treatment will cure the most lively passion: : you may, in some measure, judge from the pain the colonel’s assumed neglect of you (for assumed I am persuaded it must have been, if he ever ' ' 1 2 was

'was guilty bf neglect) has given you, how well you could bear his absolute breaking with you. I will not give you the least account of myself, or affairs, until you have, by making proper atonement for past iransgrestions, entitled yourself to

Did I labour under a similar calamity to the one you deplore, how many philosophic arguments would you not urge to teach me resignation?? indeed, greatly lament the untimely fate of this valuable lady. — I will tell you, Charles, lovely as your pen was ever accustomed to draw this drooping flower, I could not persuade myself but that half the perfections you so liberally imputed to her person and mind, were merely imputed ones.

The country is beautiful, even to excess — one fine pros pect so immediately Succeeding anotherj that, like itsop’s assj one cannot easily determine which to feast upon. I Was So fortunate as to overtake a very intelligent person at some little distance from the ■ houses, who, with a volubility naturally far from inconsiderable, (and deriving additional vigour from gratitude) poured forth a whole volume of intelligence relative to his benefactress: : — stiort, I was convinced that stie was esteemed a little goddess to the utmost verge of this happy retreat — no one thinks they can Sufficiently extol her humanity or generosityy for whoever affects the one, is sure to participate the other.

Your peace was most certainly in imminent danger from this lady’s conduct, even in a single state; and had She married you, and continued her stightiness, or bestowed her hand upon some happier rival — you would have considered a natural deprivation of her (and such, however dreadful, is the present that threatens you) as a

You must know that, without any provocation upon earth, She was pleased to quarrel with the colonel — he, fimpleton like, could not conceal the uneastness her behaviour gave him — She, elated with success, resolved to give him a proof of her power beyond human patience to support. It was So foolish an affair, that I do not remember particulars — but, contrary to her expectation of feeing him at her feet, acknowledging her sovereignty, and entreating forgiveness, sbe roused the lion in his den he Jlalked abroad and the wide forejl trembled at his roar — in other words, he was so highly provoked by her ingratitude and folly — that he no longer scrupled venting his due resentment— — pretty soul shed Some crocodile tears — he was within an ace of being Softened, when suddenly sbe bounced away with all the dignity and

away her transgreffions, that he was ready
to hang himself for having forced them

It was death to me, you may easily believe, to behold Such a Scene; and whilst I

Conscious that fly deserved no Small punishment for the preposterous part fly had acted — I could not for my Soul pity her — and did not doubt but a third part of the indifposition was merely counterfeited, in order to intimidate her Slave into, due obedience.
The morning arrived — sbe obeyed the breakfast Summons, though sly looked like a witch J and I am firmly of opinion had never closed her eyes the whole night. My mother was feared at her countenance, and a profusion of tender inquiries of her health (and not one reproach) was the consequence.

A Speech occurred to me, which I could have wistied him to have made; I ventured, however, to place it to his account — it staot through and through her gentle heart, and stie sunk, with becoming grace, into my arms. — At this unlucky instant the enamoured youth Sneaked into the room — with a view, no doubt, to obtain a mitigation, if not an absolute revocation of his cruel sentence. You are no stranger to the manly beauty of his countenance — what a metamorphosis — no hunted devil ever looked like him -- he started — ■ he made an effort to retreat — but the dying fair — with unspeakable judgement opened her eyes at the very juncture — and besought him to continue where he was — he obeyed— — could do

As Providence has graciously spared you, my aunt’s conduct cannot justly be condemned — but had you been lost to us for ever, what amends could stie have made me, for depriving me of my stiare of necelsary attendance, and taking a last farewell of one so tenderly beloved? I cannot Soibear resuming my former employment, of endeavouring to open your .eyes to Some evils that again Seem to threaten youj — it is a

part of friendship not to be easily dispenfed with. Your heart, my love, has by no means received either a due impression of the mercies you have experienced, or of the instability of human felicity. Is it not astonisbing that, fusceptible as you are in general, you should be callous here? but no, your giddy imagination presents you with no other idea of what is past thana common incident, as likely to have befallen any other personas yourself— — believe me. Such judgments are highly erroneous; — if we are to confider ourselves as under the immediate protection and direction of an all wise Power, — can we conceive that whatever seeming accidents reach us, have no further meaning in them, than merely affecting our corporeal part “a
“Sparrow cannot fall to the ground without “the permission of its creator — will we then deem ourselves of less value than they?
A visitation of the kind you have met with, could not be more estential for any
human
 57
humhn being than yourself; I wish I could add Salutary at the Same time; the eminence of pleasure you had attained — the blooming graces of your person— — the idle admiration by which you was Surrounded, contributing to persuade you that you was more than mortal.
But Surely the Sudden change ought to have furnished you with a new Set of sentiments— — could you withstand Such palpable conviction of the insufficiency of
p
youth, prosperity, and adulation, to preserve you from the hand of sickness, or the jaws of death. Notwithstanding this subject may not be So entertaining as many others, do not treat it with disgust or disregard; for none can exceed it in importance. You would most certainly have committed Some gross error, to the destruction of your peace, if not your reputation, had you not been So happily prevented — and you ought to esteem all you have Suffered, as the most fortunate of

events.

YOU complain of neglect — why faith,

the dictates of my heart — prattle love without interru]>tion or restraint, and have a fair prospect of prevailing upon her to be rnine, besore sbe can receive any further contamination. Her vivacity, indeed, is sofar recovered, that I could not answer for the consequence if sbe Was to get loose in her single state — sbe certainly is not accountable to any one for her actions — and sbe is not of a disposition to submit to impertinent control. But if once her fate was united to mine, I am convinced that the gentlest perfuasions would be sufficient to preserve her from irregularities; my authority, as I myself should never presume upon it, would have the greater weight with her, and her gratitude effect more than a thousand arguments. How can I be surprised at the lengths her vivacity transports her, when .even my sedateness is but a poor Security for me, when exalted by her approbation : with her it is a constitutional, with me only an occasional animation. The strength
of
 63
of it, therefore, must be extreme, and the merit of having it under due regulation, unspeakable. She is at present exempt from every care : — no demands upon her tenderness — no demands upon her prudence — no demands upon her condescension. But when once initiated into the amiable characters of the wife and mo there, she would fiqd full exertion for them all. O Ned! Can you have forgotten the description I gave you of her when at the play? Has she not lovely sensibility— — not her tears, judiciously bestowed, bear testimony of the goodness of her disposition?? innocent distress of the children — the heartrending sorrow of the parent — did they not Suitably affect her— —

Miss Pittborough to Miss Nancy
Pittborough.
HOW unfortunate, my dear lister,
that your very instructive, your valuable epistle stiould reach me in such an hour of gaiety, as to answer no other purpose than to make you appear to my im. agination as a mere Hottentot.
And So you would seriously persuade me that I am restored to health for no other purpose than, as a proof of my gratitude. Sic. Sic. to become as gloomy and Sanctified as yourself?
Notwithstanding all the Suspicions you so wisely and civilly entertain of the un

soundness of my heart, give me leave to tell your matronly ladyship, that I am no more capable of rendering myself a similar being to you, with respect to outward appearance, than it is possible for you to exchange your dispofition for Such a one as mine j and yet I am bold to affirm that I have a due sense of the blessing I have recovered; and, as a proof of my Setting a just value upon it, I mean to enjoy it to the utmost.
My good discreet aunt, and the sober designing colonel, I find have united forces in order to matronize me, thereby hoping to clip the wings of my vivacity, and qualify me for the domestic hop. — What obligations do I not owe them for their kind intentions? though I cannot entirely Subscribe to the admirable measures they Seem disposed to pursue. ’
And is liberty then So light a consideration with them and you, as to be Sacrificed
to'

to Such narrow views, as making a pudding? — How I contemn your little mind ness! — No, it is the Soul of happiness, and shall not expire unfairly.
You are really a very pretty advocate for the matrimonial cause. — My father is turn ed threescore. — Well, Says you, 1 am So “happy, it is impostible for me to describe “how happy I am. — My husband and fa“ “are so much alike, that bating a Sew “wrinkles, you might mistake the one for “the other.” A most amazing Satisfaction, upon my word, lo so young a woman! — But now your eldert/ appearing gentlemen would bv no means Suit me: — I am

But, to be Serious, I must acknowledge that this colonel possesses a most extravagant Share of my good opinion : — his tenderness, his complaisance, are not without their beauties : — but a husband, my dear, is So preposterous a being -- — So like the giant, with his seven leagued boots, that our nurserymaid used to tell us of, that I own I am terrified at the bare idea of such a huge mortal falling to my lot.

Or, in all probability, as the man chosen for me is a soldier, he would have the modesty to request me to turn campaigner: — so loving, how could one refuse?

Perhaps the several officers belonging to the corps, when no immediate danger was apprehended, might be permitted to Spend the evening with their colonel and his lady : — the honour how great to them — the happiness how extreme to us : — a relaxation from their fatigue — a cordial to their commander’s spirits— — cracks his bottle and his joke with equal humour.
They have their jest, in return, a little tawdry or So; — but who could restrain them, when, in all probability, they might have but few days to live?

Deceived and flattered by appearances, I thought myself secure, and overflowing with felf fatisfaction, and big with felf confequence, I slipped away after dinner to quicken the attorney, whose slow progress with the deeds was become intolerable to me, as I considered them as the only impediment to our union.

every person I met for not being So happy as myself — and returned to Mrs. Hutchens’ to conclude the day where I began it. But how was I disconcerted, on entering. the diningroom, to find that wretched thing Sir Matthew Simpering, and, as he evidently imagined, entertaining a woman So Superior to himself, that I was astonished he could support the mortifying confciousnefs of the ridiculous attempt. Temper is not my greatest boast : — my head and heart were instantly in a flame — I was even mean in my repartees; — but Miss Pittborough was so cruel as to make i^im amends by her smiles for my acrimony.
I, however, outstayed him. Mrs. Hutchens severely rebuked her niece for her behaviour — and I boldly ventured to express my disapprobation.
Oh how lovely, how provoking sbe looked I — “It was mighty well! — sbe “had indeed prepared herself for a lec

LETTER XXXIII
Lady Sanxsey to miss Nancy Pittborough.
NOW, my dear sister, I have Some'
reason to hope, that the measure of my punistiment is complete, — and that futurity cannot have Such another stiock in store for me, as I yesterday experienced.

Preposterous promise! — delufiva expectation! — never, never again will the cup of satisfaction reach my lips. — What happy days have I not enjoyed! Neither sickness (except in a late disregarded instance) nor disappointment found the way to my habitation. But that exemption from corporeal Suffering rendered my mind diseased, far beyond the possibility of ' cure. — Not the strongest and most valuable admonitions of friendship— — the most pathetic perfuasions of love, could Save my soul from the mortal pangs it now endures.
Just turned nineteen, and lost to every felicity! — But I have carved my own for --

I remember our parting well, — Youi my dear, had some Singular forebodings of my evil destiny. — How did you entreat me not to suffer pleasure to intoxicate my reason, nor to promise myself I could gather roses, insenfible of the thorn?
I, giddily secure, laughed equally al your tender apprehensions, and prudeni advice and impatiently wistied Forth( arrival of my aunt’s carriage, to deliver ms from a repetition of the same heavy, dul lecture.
ft
It did arrive; — my heart was dividet between the transport of emerging fron obscurity, and the reluctance to be separated from you. — Tears, however, involuntarily escaped me. — We drove from thf door; — how little did I then imagine 1 was driving to destruction!
My aunt, with great good-humour, rallied me upon the foftness of my nature

telling me, that our friendship had but few precedents in the world, to which sbe was about to introduce me, to keep it in countenance; — and shall I confess, that, notwithstanding I was' sensible sbe in reality highly approved the Scene sbe had been witness to, I was more than half ashamed, that I had betrayed So much of the rustic in her presence, determining for the future to assume a less fusceptible character, in order to qualify myself for fasbionable circles.
I adhered with a'fatal steadiness to this worthy resolution j and, except that now and then the genuine dictates of my nature were too powerful for restraint, I might be said to be a few removes only from infensibility.

the colonel but understood the art
of distimulation — had he not, with a frankness and generosity almost peculiar to himself, piit his heart into my hands, — I should not so wantonly have undone either him or myself! — He conceived ideas of my principles that Were utterly erroneous. — I have indeed proved myself an angel — but it is an angel of darkness!

that the bare confession of the sentiments he had inspired me with, though to the dearest friend on earth, would be a diminution of that power. — It was my intention, my desire to be his at the long run but So fine a creature, truly, was not to be obtained in a common way. O vanity! — vanity! — thou art in general only deemed an infirmity, but in my breast 'hast proved a most pernicious vice!
So recently recovered from a most alarming distemper! — such incontestable, such engaging proofs as I was every hour receiving of the colonel’s valuable attachment! — But I was Superior to them all, — my offended pride required satissaction — I Scorned to be entrapped, though the Snare had every charm to flatter my inclination, — and one frolic more I was bent upon carrying into execution, — and you are but too Sensible how dearly that last frolic has been purchased.

My aunt’s incredulity, and the colonel’s seeming acquiescence with her opinion, were the grand ftimulatives. — Sir
ft
V Matthew I judged a proper tool for my purpose— — the conversations between Kitty and her maid, which I could now almost suspect were designed for my too busy ear, contributed in a very great degree to drive me to the extremity.
Sir Matthew, equally vain, and equally mis judging with myself, was elated with my preference of him, — and a journey to Scotland tickled his fancy (though from different motives) in a similar degree to mine.
How did I please myself the three first stages with anticipating the triumph I had prepared for myself— — composed Several very long and very absurd Speeches for the occasion- -- believed each carriage I heard was my pursuers.

Sir matthew’s conversation, though extremely brilliant, was by no means the object: of my attention : — I had other game in view, — and I still continued to support myself with the confident hope, that we Should soon be overtaken.
My Spirits, however, began to fail me the second day. — I contrived twenty little unnecessary delays, — but they were entirely disregarded; — and it was but too visible that Sir Matthew was capable of acting a negligent as well as a submissive character. — Our cruel expedition was far from receiving any check, until we reached the end of our journey.
My heart Sunk within me as I alighted. — How did I cast my eyes now on this fide, now on that! — how did I not despise my own folly and precipitation! — when suddenly my pride returned to my aid. — “What, and was I not worth the fol“ “— But they stiall repent their

“light estimation of me. — Do they ima“ “I will voluntarily return — entreat “foreivenefs — make the colonel one of my best curtfies for accepting my hand? “— No, I will die first; — and whatever “were my intentions when I first fet out, “I have now sufficient provocation to dispofe of myself, and I will be this man’s wise ?”
Sir Matthew left me a few moments to my own reflections — What a conflict! — But resentment was predominant — I became impatient for the performance of the ceremony, which was hurried over at Sir matthew’s return, and I rendered the
most miserable woman breathing!
#
I begged Sir Matthew would give me leave to retire and acquaint my friends with the step I had taken. — He, affectino great politeness, complied with my, request, and went, as 1 afterwards learned, to view the town during my being employed; —

I had determined, however, to preserve the appearance at least of resignation, and was Sitting — like Patience on a monument Smiling at grief — when I was furprised by a great noise at the door; — and before I had either power to rise, or

My infensibility continued but for a moment. — Providence was so gracious as to restore my reason, though not my utterance, except for three words only, or ihurther had been the consequence of my folly. A brace of pistols lay upon the slab — I Suppose Sir Matthew was indiscreet— — colonel distracted — and the former owes his life to a Single exclama

I will not recollect the rest. — I suffered myself to lose sight of all I held dear, — and my affliction was greatly encreased by being rather ridiculed than pitied.
But be that day for ever blotted from my remembrance! — Sir Matthew, upon the whole, treats me much better than I deserve, and his future kindness will undoubtedly depend upon my good behaviour.

LETTER XXXIV
miss Nancy Pittborough to Lady
Sanxsey.
WHAT shall I Say to my beloved,
my unfortunate Sister, under, her present circumstances? — How convey consolation clear of reflection, or convince
*
► _ ft
her that my pity, my sympathy, are hers, without adding fresh stings to her affliction?
Alas, my dear, it was but too necessary for you to learn the lesson of mortification;
»
— that path is very slippery that is strewed with flowers. — A greater evil might have befallen you; your honour, your fortune is Secure — but your talk, I grant you, is
rather hard to perform. Confider the
/
sacred engagement you have entered into,
and
ft
and that whatever were your motives, nothing can excuse your fulfilling it. Do not Suffer your thoughts to dwell upon im proper objects, but at all times accustom yourself to turn them upon the most fa vourable Side of your husband’s character. — Cultivate, and by your, approbation do justice to his real perfections, — and as tenderly compassionate and conceal his infirmities, remembering that they are merely the characteristics of mortality.
4"
As to the world, it will Soon forget the step you have taken; your fortune and title will secure you from censure. — Error and a coach and six must be incompatible.
You have not forfeited the friendship of any one, — and you have it more than ever in your power to obtain an approbation you have hitherto been a stranger to, — I mean the approbation of your own heart.

My father conjures you to be rhindful of the character you have thought proper

to assume, as you must: hereafter expect: to stand or fall in his affection, by that test of your prudence, resolution, and repentance.
He knows you to be capable of many great and good actions, and he has too much candour to conclude even in general (and too much partiality in this particular instance) that one false step can never be retrieved.
Your own understanding, astisted by cool reflection, will enable you to form a very different judgement of life, its pleasures and disappointments, than you have hitherto entertained. — You will be taught, nay convinced, that misfortunes depend in great measure upon ourselves, — as our imagination may constitute, or our reason diminisb, more than half the grievance.
0*
You will find, likewise, that every person you have connexion with (however
I
 21
ver seemingly blessed) have their Secret anxieties, and that yours perhaps, not withstanding their present acuteness, are
infinitely inserior to many.
%
The hand of death has probably robbed one of all he held dear; — some Severe chronical disease deprives another of all possibility of enjoyment; — a .third labours under those mortifications derived from the perverfeness and undutisulnefs of an only child j — a fourth is Sunk down by the compunction of an evil conscience, — 4 his friend died by his hand; — a fifth — but it is madness to attempt enumerating the evils mankind are Subject to, — and you will be Satisfied that devoting your attention to one man, agreeable to your duty, and reducing your approbation for another into the Sober Sentiments of friendship, is by no means so formidable a difficulty in practice as in prospect.
As to your request of writing to the person whose welfare you have So much at
heart,

My dear girl, the crisis is at ^ ^ length pasted, and miss Pitt

either you oit could wish her. But my happiness,
$
notwithstanding, is rather incomplete. Methinks it would be the highest pleasure, to be an eyewitness of her flouncing
vol. II B and

a
and bouncing j for I am persuaded her entanglement will sit very uneasy upon her.
ft
I followed your directions literally with respect to enflaming her pride, by well timed conversations with my Betty, who is as fly and artsul a young woman, as any sbe in Christendom.
We dissembled the greatest apprehen
V
Sions lest sbe should obtain a knowledge of what we so judiciously prepared for her ear; and so little difficulty did we find
r **
in working upon those lively passions of her heart, vanity and felf fufficiency, that sbe even went before us in accomplisbing her own mortification.
But what must be our next step requires consideration: the colonel has forsaken our house, and, in order to effectually remove himself from objects that are become disgustful to him (amongst which number
is
/
t
  3
is your unfortunate friend) is immediately going abroad j never more perhaps to return.
Surely no man alive was so infatuated; notwithstanding all the ill treatment he met with previous to the grand absurdity of her elopement, nor the elopement itself, have been able to shake his unexampled affection : he pursued her with all the expedition money or impatience could procure j but having been amused by my dexterity with an opinion during a whole day, that she was only gone out with my mother, all possibility of overtaking her was cut off. Well, after all, if I am to be So unhappy as to remain excluded his approbation, it is infinite consolation, that I have prevented Some folks, with all their haughty coquettisti perfections, from being united to him.
%
f
How amazingly fickle and perverse are those incidents of which Mrs. Fortune is
B 2 supposed;
;!

\
supposed to have the regulation! A bles sing Shall frequently and repeatedly fall into one perfon’s lap, though as repeatedly • brulh’d off and disregarded, which another dies with misery from being unable to obtain. — And can there be any blessing superior to colonel dingley’s love? — So hand ibme, so brave. So completely formed for pleasing a youthful heart! — But he is lost, to me, most irretrievably lost : — yet I fear I can never wholly subdue an attachment, that has been produdiive only of pain and vexation.
t
I wonder what lady Sanxfey will do with herself: — sbe can never have the
»
confidence to appear in town, at least till the matter is somewhat blown over j and I am sensible the country is her aversion. How Small and ridiculous sbe must feel, when sbe condescends to contemplate her. • husband’s Sweet person (especially as comparisons vi?ill be apt to Suggest themselves) j and a husoand sbe will find him in the
most
\
  5
most rigid sense of the word. Pride, pride, has, indeed, met with a Severe fall; but I have hope, it will prove an useful lesson of instruction to her; — and if giddiness and vanity were her only faults, as all her bright admirers seem to be convinced, in all probability I Shall live to see her perfection’s self; for if She will but renounce the one, I can trust the baronet for redu cing the other.
I wrote an account of her slippery conduct to her rustic relations; and, would you believe it, have thereby incurred their mortal displeasure— — it is pretty plain she has painted me in most unfavourable colours, and that prejudice is at the bottom of their undue diffatifaction. — Would I
t
4
had no greater missortune to cope with, my philosophy would then approve itself as unquestionable as unsbaken!
My mother has contracted the utmost gloom upon the occasion, grieves for the
B 3 colonel’s
I
I

6
colonel’s sufferings, yet pities the insolent cruel author of them. Ah! had her own miserable child ailed a Similar part, resent
V
ment, not compassion, would have been her portion. Strange! that we can forgive in a common relation or friend, what we should deem unpardonable in our immediate offspring.
My cousin could not have chosen a more lucky (or, as Some people would call it, unlucky) period for her elopement, if she is averse to observation and censure; for there happening to have been a, dearth of Scandal for a whole preceding week, Ihe has been mauled with unspeakable Severity. Yet I believe there is more of justice than acrimony in this proceeding; for as sbe was expected to Surpafs all the rest of her Sex as much in the beauty of her mind, as sbe had the reputation of doing in her person, you know, to be de te6led in Such an abominable trip, was Sufficient to excite amazement, and uni yersal condemnation.
  7
I now more than ever Sigh for your company; the world should afford pleasure for our public hours, and her ladysbip has kindly secured us from finding a void even in our greatest: retirement.
J
Indeed, my dear, as your father’s health still continues, without either rhime or reason, in the Same strange indeterminate state as when I left you, I could almost be so uncharitable as to fuspect, there is more of huniour than real disorder in the cafe; however, you must allow me to Say, that, at best, there is an equal share of the one and the other. How can he be So unreasonable as to require you to waste your bloom in an obscurity, which, if one may judge of his past dispofition by his present conversation, would have been altogether insupportable to himself in his day of youth and vivacity?
If he is difp usted with courts and cour.
.
tiers, can he expect that your blood should
B 4 receive
m
8 "
receive the unnatural contagion? Upon my word, if I had such a father to deal with, I would soon cure him of burying me alive : — but do not let this sally of friendly dissatisfaction give you the least offence, as I am far from meaning to insinuate the most distant reflection upon. your spirit or resolution, and only seek to relieve an overcharged mind, overcharged with mortification by the disappointment of its wishes. Accept my best thanks for the service you have done me, and let me soon receive your congratulations.

Mrs. Batson to Lady Sanxsey.
I
I Am afraid, my dear Sister, that the measures you are pursuing for the recovery of your peace, will be far from answering your expectations. What charm do you expect to find in Solitude to com pofeyour diffatisfactions? Believe me, you will only increase them. — We may lose our wretchedness for a moment in a crowd : — but in retirement it will ever cleave to us.
Why, my love, will you perpetually harp upon a string, that you are sensible can never produce harmony, and without being of the least advantage to yourself,
is so utterly displeafing to me?
Your

Your own breast will find you sufficient employment to regulate, to repress every unworthy Suggestion, and to cultivate and cberisti Such as are judicious and valuable — why will you then Seek to increase your difficulties? Are not your hands tied up? your power limited? nay even your compassion cannot be too Spa
4
ringly bestowed : your mind must be hardened into propriety, and every Soft, every deluding sensation guarded against with the utmost vigilance. Is it not madness to Seed an already desperate distemper?
But in order to Silence you for ever upon So improper a Subject, I will inform you, that I have received a very Satisfactory account of that person’s health, you so much willed me to inquire after: he bears his late disappointment with all manly resolution, and wisely determines to leave a country (for at least a Short period) where his fortune has been so unfavourable. May happiness and success be

I now insift upon his never more being mentioned; it is criminal, it is odious to know one man the master of your hand, and voluntarily suffer another to be master
f
of your heart — Be assured I will on no consideration be accessary to keeping a passion alive, that must be extinguisbed, or my affection will become the forfeit: calamities will ever endear you to my heart, but guilt infallibly exclude you.

My dear agreeable false prophet,
how do I congratulate both you and myself on the invalidity of your predictions !' The country an unfit place
0
for me at this juncture! my election of it injudicious! you was never shout in your conjectures. It was undoubtedly under the influence of my happy stars .that I resolved to take the journey, as I have derived a happiness from it that crowded cities could never have afforded me.
Oh Nancy, do not chide me, nor suffer your ever friendly brow to be contracted;; least until you have read a

— So take it in due form, as it really happened,
ft
Sir Matthew and myself, after a most: disagreeable journey — misery the companion of my breastj and mortified pride rankling in his — reached this most deplorable of mansions. The hand of time is everywhere conspicuous on the mouldering walls; — moths have for years uninterruptedly preyed upon the furniture j — owls, rooks, daws, and every species of ominous creatures seem to claim it for their own.
A housekeeper incomparably well Suited
to the antiquity of the place : — but I will not oppress you with hideous descriptions.
The third day after our arrival. Sir

Matthew made an excursion, to what place, or upon what occasion, I never gave myself the trouble to inquire; but
C 2 absent

absent he informed me he should be until the evening.
N
Relieved from my greatest mortification, I began to cast about for some means of amusing myself— — little purpose j — for amusement and this mansion I found were incompatible : I therefore determined to order the chaise, and take a Solitary view of the country. I did So — telling the man to drive me anywhere, within ten or twelve miles, that would afford me the most agreeable prospect:.
I had travelled about an hour, without finding the desired dissipation, when the beating of drums communicated a throbbing to my heart. — The horses, as the sound was Sudden, began to run restive. The man advised me to alight, but my neck was not of such consequence to me, as for me to be willing to preserve it, by foregoing so pleasing a sight as I promised myself (a red coat being a feast my eyes

had long vainly sought for) j and therefore I ordered him to go on as he intended, fori was not at all afraid.
He obeyed without farther hesitation, and at the winding of the road turned full ■upon a little army of men, marching with all military parade. The Startled horses were pleased to take a bank — the chaise overturned— — as the braces were dex teroully cut by tfie Sword of .a valiant knight, your Sister escaped every bad consequence.
The poor postboy was indeed considerably hurt, and the attending Servant would have been puzzled which first to astist, his mistress or the disabled party, had not a hero like figure approached the chaise to the relief of the former; who, miserably frightened by the accident, but much more by the object before her, most conveniently fainted, as it concealed other emotions. ^

At length, however, she revived : — but unable to support the surprise of finding herself in colonel dingley’s arms. She a second time closed her eyes, from incommunicable sensations, not infensibility.
A little cottage that was fortunately Situated near the road fide received us : the poor fellow bled stiockingly, and .the other was dispatched Sora Surgeon, whilst
I
the hospitable owner of this uncouth retreat presented your friend with a cordial of her husband’s preparing.
A matted chair (preferable at that instant to a throne) proved a comfortable support, and the compassionate colonel, forgetting to quit a hand he had for sometime held between his with the most friendly apprehension for my Safety (tho’ as I was tolerably well recovered, it was then evidently rather matter of civility than necefiity) placed himself upon a bench that stood commodiously contiguous;

I was however, at length. So unhappy as to recollect the impropriety of the appearance, and by attempting to v/ichdraw my hand from the colonel’s, awakened his apprehension likewise— — countenance pierced me to the Soul; — he clasped his
hands together — and turning from me --
It was a bitter moment.
A Silence ensued; a Silence that Spoke the anguisti of our hearts.
I, Sir, am obliged to your care — ■

I attempted to avail myself of this very agreeable offer, as it was neither decent nor eligible for me to continue where I was, but found myself unable to move. A trembling seized me : — The colonel was not in a much better condition: — and I was indebted to the Surgeon, who
conveyed me in his arms.

He was for breathing a vein (as he politely phrased it); but I insifled upon his taking due care of my Servant, before he bestowed any upon me.

the worthy old hospitable creature urged so many arguments, and the colonel So many entreaties, that I at last complied.

I arrived at Portsmouth only late last night, and as the companies are exercised every morning early at Some little distance from the town, preparatory to our grand
D 2 review
#
#
g6
review on Monday next (when the remainder of the regiment is to be assembled) I did not see any of the officers until I join’d them in the field.
As we were returning to our quarters in tolerable order, a most: unexpected accident gave new vigour to all those tender sensations I was so‘industrioufly endeavouring to stifle.
A chaise with only a lady in it turned suddenly upon us : the' horses, young and high rhettled, began to plunge, the boy was thrown, and as I soresaw the consequences might not only be fatal to the lady, but many other persons, I commanded a halt, and, with the astistance of a brother officer, before the creatures could disengage themselves from some entanglement of the shaft or harness, cut the braces, and happily prevented all further mischief.
It
f
ct
%

It was not till after the performance of this necessary business, that I perceived the lady to be no other than my miss Pittborough. — I flew to her aflistance, and have reason to believe there was more terror in my appearance, than the danger I was delivering her from; for having once recollected me, sbe sunk down in the chaise in a most pitiable condition. Some of the men conveyed the Servant to an adjacent cottage, in which place I determined to lodge his lovely mistress, until sbe might with Safety be removed : but conscious of the scene her recovery would produce, and unwilling to have any spectators, both for her sake and my own, I ordered the march to be resumed, and every officer to his proper station, telling them that I myself would take care of the lady.
It was sometime besore sbe began to revive, notwithstanding the best aflistance I could procure 5 and when sbe did open
D 3 her
f
f
38
her eyes, and again beheld her fupportihg, though felf drooping friend, she immediately turned her dear face from me, in
\
apparent embarrastinent and confusion.
I knew not how to act; — but to leave her,
1 felt was impostible. — Indeed I had lost every cruel remembrance, and all my heart was tenderness and love. But I did not long enjoy the happy delusion;;
I
dent reserve, on her part, conveyed the instant idea of my wretchedness. — The rack would have been heaven to what I
then endured : — but I was sofar master of my reason, as by a hasty retreat to Spare her the misery of beholding my fe verest emotions,
A hardened kind of composure Succeeded this grievous agony. “I can now look upon her, thought I, in the light she deserves— — she not disposed of “that hand to another, that in honour and justice belonged only to me? — has
she not rendered me miserable beyond
all
 9
all possibility of relief? — and shall her “presence occasion me such unsuitable “sensations, unmindful of so great, so “unspeakable an injury? No: I will return and convince her that, not with“ “all her loveliness, her levity “and inconstancy has broke the charm, “and I no longer confider her as worthy “my tenderness or affection.”
I was hurrying into the cot in this Savage dispofition of mind, when, no less suddenly than unexpectedly, the hero was again lost in the man. — “And dare I “complain, cry’d I, in an half articu “late accent? I, who have brought de“ “upon the most valuable of “her sex?? — it not my own neglect “of her — my presumptuously assumed“ “injudicious neglect — that impelled “her to take the desperate steps she has “done? — Was she not all amiable con descension, all modest encouragement, “before sbe suspected Schemes were form

“ing against: her? — "Was it. for rne to “attempt to restrain her inclination? — “Was not her approbation I then en joyed voluntary? — and ought I not to ‘‘ have waited her own time for the in“ “present of her hand? She “has only punistied the guilty in what “relates to me, and is herself an un “happy innocent victim. — What ravage “has not discontent already made in her ** fine face? Where is that bloom, those beautisul Smiles, that were wont to “adorn it? Blasted, for ever blasted by “a base contrivance; and the wretch not “only lives, but would meanly excul “pate himself by casting reflections upon “her.”
Some little bustle in the cottage alarming me for Miss pittborough’s safety, I instantly emerged from my hiding-place, but had the satisfaction to find her greatly recovered, and the cause of my apprehensions no other than the arrival of a surgeon.
A wild
/
 1
A wildness in my countenance, and visible confusion in my behaviour, soon engaged the mortifying attention of this felf sufficient fellow, who, as I afterwards discovered, concluded I was the lady’s relation — a relationship, Ned, that I would have purchased— — no matter— — was to my great misfortune mistaken in his conjectures. Nothing could be more awkward and constrained than the whole scene— — would have given millions for one five minutes private conversation, but there appeared no probable means of obtaining that happiness— — beyond my best hopes, the good woman, by a piece of overstrained civility, procured me the wisb’d for interview, nor shall She go unrewarded.
My military garb So forcibly recommended me to her old honest heart, that miss Pittborough Seemed to have but a second place in her consideration— — the proposal of our withdrawing into another
42
there little cabin, was apparently as much intended for my emolument as her convenience : — “The gentleman truly must
not go without his dinner.”
Her motive, however, was too worthy not to be excused: — maternal tenderness, if n weakness, is of the most: amiable kind. An only child abroad, in the army — uncertain whether living or dead — drew the tears from her venerable eyes, which I will make it my business, if possible, to wipe away.
I
In repairing to the proposed retirement, the Surgeon had the honour of assisting the lady J — an honour that my regard for her reputation would not permit me to aspire to : the felf denial cost me dear, but repays me with interest in the confciousnefs of its propriety.
The moments that were granted me by the absence of the surgeon, and honest
parade
 3
parade of the old woman, were, however, far from being employed in the manner I had promised myself. — Her pardon, her friendship were to have been Solicited but the big request was incapable of finding utterance. She, rather more collected, broke the painsul silence— — a kind sense of the little service I had done her, condescending at the Same time to intimate Some delicate apprehensions respecting the opinion I must entertain of her conduct.
How inadequate my expressions to mv feelings! I would have knelt and revealed my whole soul to her, had not the place been an insuperable objection. — Distance and coolness was all I had to depend upon; -- and in Spite of every tender Suggestion, I strictly adhered to them. No resentment remains in her breast — self accused — I entirely acquit her — and at length was a Second time deprived of all I hold valuable.
But,
♦
44
But, Ned, I did presume to tell her that I could never cease to love: — nor was She offended; — and I find myself greatly relieved by that (however unavailing) confession. The opportunity So unexpected — the reception so favourable — may it not prove a happy presage of future felicity? — The gout is not quite so quick in dispatching those it attacks, as a cannonball, but is osten as sure— — and unworthy Sentiments! — but, alas! they are the Sentiments of my heart.
The good woman, on returning from her departed guest, was alarmed at the paleness and horror of my countenance. “Your honour is ill, cry’d sbe j what ‘‘ can I do for you ?”
“You must not be uneasy, returned I;
I shall be better presently. — I will spend“ “afternoon with you, if you can but « procure me a dish of tea; — and we

I will not trouble you with the grateful professions I received from this worthy creature : — the human heart in its natural state — where vice has not struck root — is truly amiable. — I derived more real pleasure from the rude civility and genuine gratitude of this cottager, than I ever experienced in any tete-a-tete, except with yourself, and one certain person, who must ever be excepted,
I took down her fon’s name in my pocketbook, and have agreed to correspond with this humble friend. — She is to inform me, from time to time, of the good or ill fortune of her fair neighbour; — and L am to remit her news that, as nearly concerns her. I am by no means the wretched thing I was j perhaps, indeed.

On entering the parlour, the first object that Saluted my eyes was that very
impertinent Surgeon, of whom I gave you
a short

Short description in ray cottage adven
ture.
The Sight of him So unexpected — some recollections — I however blushed, and was unable to conceal my Surprise, or, if you please, in the baronet’s own sweet words, guilty consufion!

and cast a look of meaning upon the doughty Sir Matthew.
“Yes, madam, ” said the knight, “it “Seems you was most extraordinarily af fected for so common an occasion, as “well as the gentleman who did me the “honour to Show you great civility. — I understood, indeed, that he was arrived

Astonilhment — contempt — mortification and anguisti for some moments sealed my lips; — and recollection occurring,

previous to the power of utterance, I disdained making a defence at So despicable a tribunal, — but, bursting into tears of indignation, relieved my own breast, and,
I believe, both disappointed and stung the other wretches.
The baronet stared — stamped — and was perfectly frantic with rage and resentment.
t
Mr. Surgeon in vain endeavoured to account for a Silence So far different to
i
what he expected the affair would have produced. — Sits, revilings, and every species of low fury, he had prepared himself to encounter upon the occasion, from a good woman’s having fallen to his lot, who was by no means sparing in either violence or ill language, on the stightest
provocation.

her a few hours to her own inventions; — Ihe began immediately to exercise her authority as mistress. — The chaise by her orders is drawn out, — and away She drives with pleasure enough i’ll answer for her.
The fellow had his cue. — deep laid artifice! — You or I could by no means have acquitted 'ourselves So cleverly upon such an occasion. He takes a route that brings them pop upon the colonel, who was either returning from a review, or some preparatory parade; — and, the more effectually to conceal madam’s forward ness and indiscretion, at the hazard of. his own neck, overturns the carriage, — and well was he paid for it without doubt!

The poor ignorant woman gives a strange account of that part of the Scene she was permitted to be witness of. > such loving, such Sighing, Such whining, and Such dying, as Surfeits one but to think of. The Servant, at length, returns with the Surgeon, — who was led into an error by (at least) the colonel’s Sond behaviour, that I suppose occasioned my delicate cousin Some very delicate sensations. As Sure as you are alive, he concluded they were man and wise.

It Seems the gentleman Snapped him
I
up very stiort, on his communicating the ' opinion he had conceived; — which, by the way, was very impolitic, as it only opened his mouth against them both. Madam was brought home in a fine condition j — but as Sir Matthew Sorbore being
in
 9
inquisitive, and the Servants told no tales, she hugged herself with the hope that all
i
would blow over.
:. The baronet, by his lady’s perverse .stars, was engaged that very day fortnight in a hunting match j — and who stiould belong to the fag end of the company, but the very surgeon already mentioned?
I
'V
The whole party dined together, — and; the fellow happening to be naturally volu ble and communicative, and not personally acquainted with the baronet, gave them the cottage adventure, as an addition to their entertainment.
The ears of all present (except those of the dull floating husband) were Suitably tickled; -- but that unfortunate gentleman (who does not postefs the brightest understanding) unable to support the mirth of the company, though by no means ' pointed, as the surgeon had prudently

named no names, — was So mean and ri diculous as to besbrew his own nest.
ft
The company immediately Screwed their
s •
, features into a less risible form, — asfected to condole their neighbour’s misfortune; — who, casting about for revenge, and a proper unravelling of every horrid circumstance, gave Mr. Surgeon an invitation to dine with him the next day. In Short,
I
my lady, to her unspeakable confusion, was confronted; — and Sir Knight fuihci ently convinced of his disbonour.
/'
So far for information. — He then in
/
my mother to do him the justice to believe him incapable of taking a brutal or rash revenge; — but hopes neither she, nor any other of his wife’s relations, will condemn him for strewing Some resentment, where the provocation is So flagrant: — that he found the colonel was embarked; but nevertheless he had retrenched her la dysbip’s liberty, and could not Say when
he
I

. he should prevail upon himself to enlarge it: — that Ihe had deceived him in a very gross degree; for, notwithstanding he was sensible she had some liking for Dingley, be had ever considered her as a woman of the nicest honour, and the last person who would have brought either herself or him into dis reputation.
He then concludes with wisbing he could prevail upon mamma to visit hamp iliire, in order to Satisfy herself that he has not exaggerated matters j and, if pos fible, trace out Some Savourable circumstance to deliver his mind from the horror with which it is oppressed— — cannot bear to be stigmatised, as is usual in Such cases; — and he is convinced no person but herself can obviate that misfortune.”
My mother insisted upon my returning the curious epistle (which I did without one comment the instant I had perused
F 4 it)
f
72 - The H T o R Y of
it) or I would have presented you with a faithful transbript,, - ^ ^. ^

Something may perhaps be struck out of this incident. — Suppose I Should be able to prevail upon her to let me be her proxy, — and by that means facilitate your journey j — for, though you are many miles distant from Sir matthew’s, it Shall go hard with me but I will make you a visit. What a happy adventure, if productive, of Such happy consequences!

My cousin has unhappily rendered herself the whole country and town’s talk, — is a prisoner in her own house, — and, as her indiscretions have been most glaring, it is very uncertain when she may obtain her enlargement.
For my part, I cannot conceive wsbat end Ihe could propose to hersejf in granting

error. It seems the colonel was So very unguarded in his behaviour, as to give sbe alarm— — old cottager called in a neighbour,. — who being So Situated as to ©ver hear their whole conversation, made Such a report, as I would much rather you should conceive, than I describe.
It was at all times evident, that your fisher w5s by no means indifferent resped ing her colonel, — though sbe delighted in displaying her power, and rendering him
r
uiciculous; — nor was it necessary to in sbrm> any beholder how steeply .he was caught. I only mention this circumstance

and, notwithstanding all my efforts, am capable of making but an indifferent defence.

Suppose my uncle was to exert himself upon the occasion? — Perhaps he might be able to effect a tolerable accommodation; — otherwise God knows what may be ' the consequence. — Her reputation, howevercln all events, is utterly demo lisbed; — and though I may be So unhappy as to incur your displeasure a Second time, in return for my concern for a thoughtless
relation, I must presume to repeat my’’ wish, that sbe had still remained Safe in, your harmless village. — A dispofition that is naturally mischievous, cannot be better restrained than by pure air and narrow precincts.

Her language was ever the language of Sincerity, and, however She may have descended to err, sbe Scorns to deceive.
As to the wretch who is now most unhappily master of her fate, sbe is abundantly his superior, even, in her present disgraceful circumstances; — for; at least, her manner of supporting his ill treatment of her has a merit in it, that his ungenerous Soul must never pretend to. I have hitherto dealt out reprehenston and instruction with a liberal hand; — but I must acknowledge, notwithstanding the advantage a mere stander by has, upon every occasion, over the parties engaged, (from being free from passion, and devoid of prejudice,) that sbe Could not have acted more properly by the best advice I am capable of giving, — than sbe has now done from the dictates of her own prudence and understanding. — Yes, my aunt, I am proud to • ■ think with how much dignity and pro,

heart (the bad effects of too great indul

I wrote to her ladysbip’s miserable moping Sister previous to my journey, but did not mention one Syllable concerning it:
I knew her too well to expose myself to the danger of an impediment. I really question. Such is her dislike of my hard
i
nature (as sbe politely calls it), and dotage of her sister, but that, rather than not have prevented my going, sbe would have torn herself from father, spouse, and beloved chimney corner.
Well, but I am arrived. nothing worth mentioning occurred in my journey. Sir Matthew gave me a most genteel reception. — We talked the matter over, — shook opr wise heads with great judgement, — lamented our share in madam’s disgrace— — laid the groundwork for some future detections.

A black bandage over the left eye, an intolerable stoop in the shoulders, and a pair of awkward dangling arms, are all the personal perfections this John Jones can boast. — How strange a metamorphosis of your quondam strutting friend! — The good wife is to continue only one five minutes longer in this corrupt place, as sbe has relations so visit, in a distant part of the country j but John is to be conducted, immediately after her departure, to jackfon’s cottage, there to enjoy pleasures unknown to aspiring hearts.
However colonel Dingley, by one singular attachment, suffered his life to be a continued gloom, in the person of John Jones, he is far from being an object of companion. He can boast as indulgent a master as ever fell to worthy lad’s share; has free access to his purse; their wardrobe
is in common; and when John is disposed

Restored tonewhfe, how agreeably
was I surprised, my dear, this bjeffed morning, to find a well dreffed officer in So mean, So dismally Situated, a church, as the one I at present Srequent.

I had the pleasure soon to perceive that he was a man of gallantry. — He Singled me out, not in preference to the Hottentots, but her languisbing ladysbip, as best meriting his attention and contemplation.
I protest the unexpectedness of his presence, and the distinction he was pleased to pay me in the face of all beholders, inspired me with uncommon vivacity. — I played off a Sew attractions j — had the Satisfaction to perceive they were not thrown away upon him; — and in our return home, putting my head out of the Window, from a curiosity I could not restrain, with rapture discovered that he was jogging aster us in close conference with one of Sir matthew’s servants

He says, “he never law me feofuchadvantageinhis life — perfectly ir ‘ “^refistible j — but it is both cruel and un j; iiftifiable to attack a stranger in so close, “■so vigorous a manner, as to deprive him ofail possibility of resistance or defence.”
ft
Th is piece of raillery was Suggested by the buz that ran through the family, So sbon as we reach’d our gloomy habitation, that miss Hutchens had made a conquest J. — but as we are most horribly remote from every amusement, and the baronet keeps but little company, except his companions of the hunt, I almost despair of this charming adventure pro •ucing any happy effects.

I own if he is a than of spirit and address, it would not be an unconquerable difficulty to introduce himself, and a little flirtation highly eligible at this juncture, on my part; for the colonel’s abrupt departure, — unabated dislike ■ — every mortifying and discouraging circumstance of that most disagreeable affair, have sunk my gaiety to So lovv an ebb, that I even languish for dissipation.
Show me the woman, either in town or country, that can behold a red coat with indifference? — There is a bewitching je northeast Lai quai in the very colour, — and ast your fine tall Sellows, from the uniformity of their honourable livery, are in much the same degree striking. Indeed, I must allow that the colonel has infinitely the advantage of this stranger in both features and figure; — but his stubborn neglect has piqued me unspeakably, — and 1 begin to

way, — that I protest I shall be Somewhat chagrined, though I cannot say entirely
if I never behold him more.
Sir Matthew resumed his raillery after dinner, far from disagreeably, and has promised to do everything in his power, towards procuring me the additional pleasure of a gay acquaintance : — he Says, he is So extremely sensible of the heavy dull life I lead, and how uneasily in reality (though patiently in appearance) it must be Supported, that he thinks it incumbent upon him to pursue every step that is in the least degree promising of amusement.
I consess his conversation was never more pleasing to me than at that period, as it communicated a cheating hope to

Seels a growing tender for the wife of his friend) are the only persons I have had an opportunity of conversing with ever since my arrival. — I have had a distant prospect, indeed, of a whole crowd of bucks, with heated complexions, and all the rapture of eager pursuit dancing in their eyes; — but the hounds have Soon forced them from my sight, and nothing has remained but odious ina

She has picked up a swain (with the baronet’s kind aflistance) that sbe is apparently delighted with. I was greatly apprehensive that her satisfaction would have been productive of much uneafiness to me, but have been most agreeably disappointed.
My persecution for the three days this young fellow has been with us, has almost totally subsided.

Captain Briton, though by no means handsome, is really very agreeable; he seems naturally to have more of honesty and humanity in his composition, than folly, or effeminacy; but in order to please Such ladies as his present flame, he renders himself not many removes from a finished
A
coxcomb.
His behaviour, however, is at times very inconsistent and contradictory, from his adapting it with great judgement to the
f
humour and inclinations of his immediate companion. — With Sir Matthew he Sings' a good Song; — takes his glass freely, tho'’ not indiscretely and throwing off the.
fop both in appearance and conversation is quite the plain downright Soldier (a character he fias heard that gentleman greatly extol); for, however fribbling him

not greatly mistaken, frankness and can

are his most prevailing characteristics. — Yet on kitty’s approach he So instantly and naturally assumes that idle gaiety peculiar to her taste, that, I consess, I know not what to make of him.
ft
Sir matthew’s acquaintance with him was mere accident. He brought him to tea with us; and after the first ceremonies had in some measure familiarised us, — he began to trifle so prettily with miss Kitty;
'— amused the baronet So agreeably; — and at the Same time bestowed Some little, not unacceptable, notice upon your poor long

As an instance of his goodness of heart, I must mention the humane attention he expressed to this favourite domestic’s hap'

This Same John Jones, Ned, is a lad of inconceivable resolution. —
He had a temptation cast in his way a few days ago that brought it to a Severe test, : — ■ the conflict was great; a whole army of passions endeavoured to shake it; — but it, nevertheless, came off victorious.

mounted : — for as the world is So ingeniously malicious as to strike deadly strokes without even a stiadow of Soundation, it was but natural to apprehend its Severest censure, if circumstaiices were once ambiguous, or unguarded; — and it was far from being improbable in the present instance, if ever a certain frolic Should get air, that many would conclude there was more of love for the one lady, than a desire of humbling another in the cafe; — especially if such an advantage was taken of it, as introducing a suspicious and highly improper person under the baronet’s roof

every other attendant on cruel disappointment, shrink behind my chair, in visible apprehension of being totally discarded.
Never was woman more extolled for infernal graces than miss Pittborough by my happy friend 1 — Her person I have reason to believe has undergone a Severe alteration, but the beauties of her mind shine forth in all their native lustre. Vi
ft
vacity has given place to matronly decorum; but as her reserve is adorned with iweetness, Sensibility, and politeness, not the result of four dissatisfaction, or Sly hypocrisy, it is unspeakably amiable, and must be permanent.
The captain, from a too forward zeal to communicate a ray of pleasure to miss pittborough’s heart, as he would conceive her dejection to be chiefly on the colonel’s account, ventured to mention him. — Oh, Ned, vvhat lovely, though I apprehend

painful confusion did it not occasion her! — but it was the consusion of friend iliip, not displeafure.
She listened with willing attention to a fictitious account of his wandering resolution;; imagines him by this time on Some distant part of the continent; — ■ where Briton assured her, her image would be his companion; his undiminished love, the quickest pulsation of his heart, and a knowledge of her happiness, the most essential information for his peace.
She not only permitted but desired him to give his friend assurances of her good wishes, her gratitude, and approbation of his conduct. — How Salutary, how reviving, how flattering this condescension!! — with a prudence that does honour to her Sex, begged, that the Subject might never more be introduced, for reasons his. own good sense could not permit him to be iq.norant of; — and Such traces of Sal
2 tis faction
/
148
tisfaction have ever Since been visible in her afpectj as evinces the success of this friendly attempt to comfort her, by putting a period to her fuspence, respecting a fugitive’s fate.
Delicacy, Ned, is a prime, nay, an almost peculiar perfection of the fair Sex; we admire, we suhscribe to the excellence of it, even in the disappoinrment of our - willies.
Though nature may have been sparing of personal charms, yet with this endov/ ment, the young can never fail to please; and without it, the utmost loveliness must Sink into, disesteem : it is as imperceptible in its operation (where an innate principle), yet as active and inexhaustible as the blood, that now quits, and now returns to the beating heart; and its beauty is equally concealed from its posteffor.
Did
 49
Did the innocent and inexperienced but know its value, what a happy regulator it would prove of their conduct:! — Instead of making unworthy concessions to gratify the importunity of the ungenerous and designing, it would teach them to look them into confusion, and awe them into virtue.
How fatal that tender sensibility, that artless apprehension of wounding the peace of a lover, by judicious rigour! — it is a wound that heals without any application and So far from proving of bad consequence to either party, ' confirms the attachment of the one, and displays. the worth of the other.
Such are its effects in a single state; — but in the married it becomes of still more importance. — The double trust a wife is charged with (her husband’s honour, no less than their own, depending upon her good conduct) demands a double exertion
L 3 of

nf this all faving virtue; — for it is not enough that her conscience is free from hlaine, but her behaviour must bid defiance to fuspicioil.
What, in appearance, can either be more natural, or innocent, than that miss Pittborough should have expressed a friendly curiosity concerning the colonel’s fate? — Where the offence against modesty or decorum? — She was alone with a friend; — sbe knew him to be at an immeasurable distance, and incapable of every thought to the qrrejudice of her honour or reputation; — sbe could rely upon her own integrity of intention: — therefore, why not for a moment indulge the remembrance of his love; — and hear his Sentiments and declarations once more repeated by this
chosen confidant?
♦ >
But, no : her delicacy Secured her from acting so indiscreet a part. — Might not; the captain conclude sbe had a more
tender
 51
tender motive than friendihip for making him the Subject of her conversation?? — > he not communicate both the foundation and nature of such an inference? — Might not the colonel be more than half inclined to confider them as an indirect encouragement to flatter himself that on
one contingence fly was ready to be his, if he even resisted the temptation of casting himself in her way, from being assured he was Sar from being indifferent to her.
The captain has many friends; takes his glass with a freedom that warms his blood, though many degrees inferior to
intoxication. — Might he not in the' over
\
of his good-humour betray the distinction Ihe paid him by her confidence, — as from the very nature of the ’ subject would Seem to imply, — especially, as it was ever introduced at stolen periods, from a consciousness of its unfuitableiiefs for every ear. — these friends, in the course
L 4 of
9
152
of their connexions, would probably be as unguarded as himself j and for the Sake of embellisbment, exaggerate the whole matter; — until he would be absolutely constituted a go-between, a person introduced merely for the convenience of interchanging, or communicating the parties Sentiments; — whilst they themselves would be So far from suspecting the consequence of their indiscretion, that they would even Shudder at the private idea of such a practice. Notwithstanding which, every unfavourable report would again be revived, every little circumstance recollected j — until it was worked up into the very worst that could be propagated; — until the very worst would be believed.
I need not trace the consequences, as they are self-evident j — not even an incident common to humanity, by giving the colonel a justifiable opportunity of renewing his pretenflons, could wipe off

Monday Morning.

Six o’clock, P. M.
In what w’ords Shall I relate this day’s adventure! an adventure, which, respect
ino'

ing my Share in it, ought to be wrote in letters of gold : — but the blackest of characters are abundantly too fair to mention the infamous author.
ft
I will only alk one question, and then give it history wise, — and command your attention. — All is well, and now my pen is at your service.
How reluctantly I yielded to captain briton’s arguments, respecting the necessity of my attendance, you are already well acquainted withst happily, however,
I did at length yield, and with palpitating heart, or rather, in pretty much the same condition in which a poor criminal (to
ft.
the emolument of each unfeeling spectator) is dragged along by slow degrees to Tyburn, did I follow the gaily dressed captain to Sir matthew’s j^for as the ladies had offered him a seat in the coach, from an over strained point of complaisance, he did npt think it sufficient to

meet them upon the road, and be taken upi, but he would needs Hart with them in the.
ft
first instance,
By the time we arrived, the coach was in readiness; and the Surgeon (who had slept there the preceding night, and was to squire them on horseback) had mounted his proud steed, which was pawing about
w
the courtyard, impatient of restraint; and I could xperceive that Miss Kitty, brimfull of vanity, and the knight grinning with felf complacence, only waited for the loveliest part of the company, to be ready alfp,
A hag, greatly resbrnbling Mrs. salmon’s mother Shipton, entered the parlour
with precipitation, I thought I Should

have fainted. — “No accident, I hope?” cried the Surgeon, as She palled the hall door in her return. — “No: only my “lady finds herself a little indisposed, and “as file would not be an interruption to

I revived inscnfibly on hearing a language So punctually repeated, that was by no means strange to my ears; — but casting a look upon the Surgeon, Saw disappointment and chagrin had driven the ruby from his cheek, and that he was preparing to dismount; though for what pur pose, I was unable to conjecture.
Some little distatisfaction in the parlour was the consequence of the mestage they had received. — Miss Kitty flouncing into the coach, declared aloud, that she loved airs in her heart. — Sir Matthew followed, protesting he was quite of her sentiments; but he would endeavour to. make her amends for the slippery trick his vt^ife had played her, by procuring her a more eligible companion, at a friend’s
house, at some little distance, — The cap

tain cast a significant glance upon me; whilst Mr. Surgeon, on being offered the vacant place in the coach, until they reached the other lady, declined it with
visible confusion- -- -- -- out,
“That perhaps her ladyship might be so ill “as to require his attendance; and there“ “he would wait an houp or (o; and “as the sight was nothing new to him, “he should be no loser, as he would do himself the pleasure of joining them at “dinner.”

Captain Briton again looked upon me with meaning; — my heart understood him, — and I got off my horse unobserved by a fellow, whose deep designs, and unexpected success, absorbed every other consideration.
f
I entered the house Soon after, at the invitation of Sir matthew’s huntsman; who found me So disordered, that he was by no means Surprised I did not follow

iny master : — he kindly conducted me to the kitchen fire, and giving me a salutary cordial, I began to be more composed. The Surgeon, in my hearing, desired Mrs. Hag to furnish him with proper apparatus for bleeding her lady; — telling her he would wait in the dreffing room for her commands: — “And as it is very early, ” added he, “perhaps her ladyship may not ‘‘ be disposed to rise j — you had therefore “better get your own breakfast, before you “insorm her for whar purpose I remain “behind.” I desired my friend the huntsman to go with me into the garden, as I hoped the air would be of use to me; he did so, and so soon as .we had gained a
i
handsome terrace, that was extended each way beyond the front range of the apartments, I began to inquire into the situation of the rooms, for entertainment, c— — huntsman, in gratifying my curiosity by a description of the house, informed me, that Sir matthew’s chamber windows commanded that walk, a cir

I believe it was only one quarter of an hour in reality (though an age in appear, snee) that I remained so unhappily agitated; — when the huntsman starting, cried

“Where, where, my friend, ” exclaimed I, and staring with horror, let uafly to “her aflistance.” “we’ll call the maids, ” returned he. The gardener’s ladder happened to stand against a jessamine tree at a little distance, that wanted his care. — The

however, by his timely interposition, both were luckily prevented. — The bandage indeed, by his struggling, was torn from my " eye; but, in order to guard against a misfortune of the Sort, I had that morning, by Captain briton’s advice, put on the additional covering of a large piece of sticking plaster, which remained unmoved. We instantly bound the rascal hand and foot, and locking him up in a secure closet, left ■ him to his meditations.

At length the housekeeper came down, — and gave me the comfortable information, that her lady was much better than could have been expected, considering the fright; but that her nose and mouth were greatly hurt. She had with her usual goodness inquired who She was indebted to for her preservation; and on being told it was captain briton’s Servant, ordered this woman to beg, that he would wait his master’s return at her house, and command everything he should standpn need of; — adding, that as Soon as fly was tolerably composed, she should be glad to thank him herself for so singular a service.

The gay, the all prevailing Kitty had formed a party for an idle excursion; and I was destined to participate, or at least dis fcmble a participation of her pleasure; but when the morning arrived, I found myself So ill affected to the journey, that I ventured under the Sanction osmy friend captain briton’s presence, to beg the company’s excuse, and the baronet’s perpiistion to stay at home.
He Surlily complied with what he called my perverse Sancies; — Kitty was Smart, as usual upon Such occasions; neither of which reached my repose; and as it was very early in the morning, and I found.

I never at any time was suspicious myself; and in order to avoid every Species of fuspicion, or disagreeable treatment, 1 had made it a point ever Since my disgrace, to leave the door of my apartment at the mercy of my inquisitive duenna, and equally. inquisitive husband.
How long I had slept I am wsbolly ignorant; — I was however at length awakened, though not alarmed, by Some one’s entering the room : — but before I had time to inquire what her diligence sought after, (concluding it was the housekeeper) and why I was disturbed, contrary to my orders, — I heard the door bolted, and locked on the inside.

He drew instantly to the bedside, and violently seizing me, cried, “My dear creature Shall be informed; — only don’t betray ‘ yourself, and your honour is Safe; — but if you are So weak and Simple as to “disregard the voice of reason and love, “you must take the consequence both of my roughness and the world’s censure; a world that is prepared to judge you with the utmost Severity, from errors in “your conduct in which I had no Share.

Do not now leave the victory incomplete— — well regulated corps receives repeated Shocks undaunted; and it is that composure alone that can Save them from becoming a prey to the enemy. — If they but once turn their backs j — if the order of their ranks is but once too much broken; — a precipitate, confused, and fatal retreat must be the consequence; and after having Sustained the heat and fury of the battle, until the ijgnal was already given for flying before their conquering
arms, they in one unguarded moment suffer the palm to be snatched from their hands; and their lives and liberties become one Horrid Sacrifice.
My patience, I consess, in one respect is perfectly exhausted. — Your native air, and the soft foothings of friendship, would he highly salutary in your present circumstances. — propose making us a Speedy visit, to your haughty monarch; he must

He either knows not your value, or his heart is most basely corrupt, to suffer you thus to wither in your bloom, unsheltered and unpitied. Indeed, my good girl, your day of probation has been of long continuance, but depend upon it your reward is at hand. I have watched over your conduct with both a steady and anxious eye, and have had the happiness to find it, ever since you became a wife, such as I could have wished;; one and twenty is but an early period, to have run the race of folly to an end.
My father, my husband, join with me in beseeching you not to disregard my request of coming to us. Our affection for you is increased by your increase osmerit, and I once more repeat, that is it is pos fible to Save you, you Shall not be lost. As to your ambition of standing Sair in the colonel’s opinion, it is both natural

and laudable. — How Providence disposes everything in your favour is strikingly evident from your accidental acquaintance with captain Briton. — Not one of your perfections are to be unknown; your prudence, your resignation, - your delicacy, and your love of virtue, even for its own lake, are all happily evinced by your late conduct; and I think it is most advisable; to leave the concealment or divulging of it entirely to the captain’s own option : — he undoubtedly knows the man he has to deal with, and whilst he does justice to your reputation, must be incapable of wounding your repose.

I am greatly puzzled to divine what So good a kind of man can find in our strange unfeeling cousin Kitty, to attach him. — How will his friend ever be brought to approve Such a choice r — Will it not occasion an infallible breach between them?

Nor will that last Scene, I am afraid, afford either more instruction to her acquaintance, or honour to herself, than those sbe has already passed. I am Surprised my aunt can Suffer her at So early an age, to be thus giddily mistress of her own inclinations, especially as sbe has not only an extensive knowledge of life, but human nature itself— — in short, that is her foible: — sbe is too

STRANGE news, my dear sister!! worthy appearing captain Briton has descended to so mean, so Scandalous an action, as carrying off a raw unthinking girl, who, regardless of the consequence, has consulted no other monitor than her vanity, and is captivated by no other charm than a gay outside.
L am both mortified and astonished at being made the dupe of his artifice. — How did he impose upon my easy credulity, —
%
engage my approbation and good opinion, by a conduct So unisorm and unexceptionable, that I considered him as abundantly too good for the creature he has made choice of! — But to steal away in so un genteel, so ungentleman like a manner, —

practises, — or he would never have entered a family in the disadvantageous, the despicable light of a runaway and Seducer; for such I am persuaded my poor aunt will confider him. I every day was expecting proper proposals to be made by him, or I stiould not have Suffered matters to proceed the visible length they even had done.
I am grieved to think, how the fond mother’s heart will be wounded by this premeditated act of disobedience— — can I give her other consolation than as furing her, that his behaviour was the behaviour of a gentleman, — his conversation agreeable to every tenor of propriety and honour. — But this will little avail
vol. II Q, her,

her, when so recent an instance of his deviation from every favourable appearance, — contradicts what he would have intifnated were his real principles.
I know not how to conduct my self upon ' this occasion— — the hint he once gave me respecting the colonel, cam he of no service to either the afflicted mother or misjudging daughter, and might too probably draw ungenerous reflections upon me.
The world we know is malicious, and has so fruitful an invention, that I should not be Surprised (on. such a circumstance’s transpiring) if it was to charge me with being accessory to the whole Scheme, if not the Sole concerter of it;;; — with encouraging the captain to visit at our house ~ him to recommend himself to Sir Matthew, in order to secure his footing; — and by displaying the charms of Miss kitty’s handsome fortune, inciting him to the bold step he has So fuccefe fully carried into fexecution..

I am So weak and low, that I will not answer for the consequences of an addi tional Shock j but if you think it necessary I should expose myself to it, I will gladly run all hazards. My faculties are really so impaired, I dare not rely upon my own judgement in any case; — therefore shall come to no absolute determination, until I receive your friendly and judicious advice. sirmatthew, by his invitation of her to his house,, rendered himself in some measure answerable for every evil that may befall her; — nor am I Sorry that he should bear the burden.
As to your very kind, your very agreeable request: of feeing me at your village, I own it grieves me that I cannot comply with it; but I will give you my objections, and exculpate myself from every undue charge by anticipation. In the first place, then, I have reasbn to believe that I am fb
much reduced in my strength and spirits, as to be unequal to the journey; — and as to obtaining Sir matthew’s consent, I am

convinced I could as easily level mountains, and restrain the impetuous waves. I would not be uncharitable, but the man who could for so long a time behold the visible decay that has overspread my countenance unmoved, — must be incapable of giving into any proposition merely to prevent its fatal continuance.
Be content, my sister;; — and this
«
world are irreconcilable : — I fall a martyr to my own indiscretion— — what my bloom and years have lost, I hope my mental part has gained. — I have made the best preparation I am able, as I can perceive no possibility of avoiding the blow, to support it with due resignation.
But I have a stronger motive to detain me, than either of the foregoing.
Sir Matthew has so heated and fretted
himself for sometime past, that he has
thrown his whole mass of blood into a fermcnt. “His head and stomach have been
more than once severely attacked, though
for
 29
a short period; and unless the disorder can be brought into the extreme parts, and terminate in a good stiarp fit of his gouty distemper, the odds are greatly in his dif favour; — and notwithstanding I seem to be in almost the last stage of my existence,
I may yet survive his dissolution. I have hitherto supported my character of a wife, with all the decency and propriety my unhappy circumstances would admit. — I certainly injured him, in making him only a tool of my resentment, and have much to be forgiven. The prospect of death may occasion a change in his sentiments— — if we can mutually pardon, and mutually afisst each other, — in this most trying, this most important of exigencies; — we may, perhaps, in great measure atone for our mutual transgref
Sions.

I believe Sir Matthew has been very faulty in the beginnning of his life. — May all his errors not only be recollected, but expiated! But So Sar however from pro

moting this necessary work, by yielding to selfish considerations, and absenting myself at this juncture, I should drive him to all those passionate extremes a weak mind and suffering body are so liable to fall into. I know the goodness of your heart too well, to apprehend you will either disapprove or attempt to shake my resolution— — as you may rest assured of this melancholy truth, that it is beyond the power of medicine, or the most friendly assiduity, to restore me. — I am a mere walking ghost, and actually totter on the verge of eternity.
Adieu, my best beloved, my most valuable of sisters— — Separation will be only momentary; — when you have sought your goodfght.^ andfinijhed your course— — shall again be reunited for ever and ever. Do not let the dropping off of So miserable a weed affect you beyond measure; the fault was in the soil; — but by being tranfplant cd, its rancour will be lost, and it will then

pardon; acknowledging in the face of the whole mob, that he was the most hardened of Sinners : for that he was already married to an honest. Sober woman, who loved him to distraction. T. he mob, enraged by this confestion, having learned his bustness at Edinburgh from the delighted matt’s officious communicativeness, were for treating him very roughly; but the colonel humanely prevented their intention, by beckoning his servant, who he perceived on tip tee at some little distance, a happy Spectator of the whole scene, and delivering him to his cafe until further orders; who, with the assistance of two fellows he had some little knowledge of, conveyed him Safely to the colonel’s inn, though not without a rude salute or two from the attending rabble, who with loud huzzas and hiffings accompanied him to the very entrance.
The story was in every body’s mouth; — “How that miss Kitty Hutchens, a - young lady of great fortune, had narrow“

every possible aggravation j “and all by the “accidental interposition of one colonel “Dingley.” The mortification and confusion of kitty’s aspect; is unspeakable r the colonel was apprehensive, lest the violence of her passions might have some bad effect, unless timely di (charged — he therefore addressed her in a sneering kind of accent, and offered her his protection, until ' ffie could conveniently return to London.
“Take me, ” said stie, “take me but out of “this mob; I have nothing further to alk.” — He tucked her arm under his, (as she apparently stood in need of Support) and conducting her in Such a manner as to gratify the Spectators with a view of her person, lodged her Safe in a house of reputation; when ordering coffee, he most pro vokingly congratulated her upon her happy deliverance.

LETTER XXXV
V ...» \
Dingley to Mr. Brooksbank.
ft
*. V ^ »
Gome, my friend, we will fouse into the tale, without either preface or introduction.
On my arrival at Portsmouth, in order for my embarkation, in the same house where I was accustomed (and on. this occasion lodged) lodged also this worthy young man. His aspect was clouded with dejection, — his mind visibly disturbed, and his fortune, from some hints my landlady had obtained, to the last degree desperate.
An air of gentility in his person, and engaging candour of his countenance, inclined me to wish for some conversation with him. — “He is unfortunate, ” said I, “confequentlycompaffionate; and by find“ “a comforter himself, may be taught to “astume that character, and in Some mea“

* ft. •,
“Sure contribute to heal my deep woundt “ed bosom.”
I in vain, for several days, sought an opportunity of casting myself in his way without abruptness j his modest reserve and honest shame] ] him to fly an, however, kind pursuer
\
mentioned my ill success to my landlady; who having conceived a high opinion of her guest, and at all times desirous of obliging me, very readily undertook to bring us together.
V
The first interview was mutually painful; a diffidence on his part, and a fear of oppressing the unfortunate on mine, laid us under great constraint.
We repeated the same Scene again and again; until I by a frank communication of my own circumstances, brought him to disclofe the nature of his.
He was, I found. So unhappy as to lose a good father in his twelfth year; — his
R 2 mother
244
/
mother naturally gay, and only then isb the prime of her life, looked out immediately for a second partner. Nor was she long unsuccessful: — a fellow of great volubility, and some small Skill in physic, paid his addresses, and Soon became master of her person and fortune.
f
Her first husband, a mercer,, was So infatuated as to leave her a discretionary power respecting all his affairs; as likewise of the education and dispofition of this his only fon. She, with the Same genero rofity, made no terms with his Successor;; became, with her child and fortune, entirely at his mercy. The man was, however, far from ill natured, though prodigal and foppisb : he instantly parted with the honest stock in trade, — setup his equipage, — and was dubbed physician. He continued the boy at fchobl until he attained his sixteenth year, and then removed' him with great eclat to the university. Tom (for that is honestly one of his names) concluding from his father’s manner of
living,
ft
\
 45
living, and the almost extravagant Supplies he received, that his fortune was confider able, did not scruple to indulge a youthful inclination. His studies, indeed, were not neglected, as they proved his delight j he purchased a handsome library, dressed with elegance, gave pretty entertainments to his brother students, and was well received by every female within ten miles round. The vacations were spent in London; at one of which periods his father kindly intimated, “that he did not require him to apply, himself to any particular branch of “literature, as he was far from intending “to clog so promising a genius with the “trammels of business; but when he was “sufficiently qualified, would purchase a
“genteel employment for him under the government, that stiould not fall stiort.of “his most flattering expectations.” Thus entirely released from every doubt or apprehension respecting his future provision, and naturally gay, facetious, and entertaining, he devoted a larger stiare of his
I
; time to pleasure, than he had ever before
R 3 ven
\
246
ventured to do; nevertheless always keeping to the windward of extravagance; or in other words, regulating his expenses by his remittances. In this round of dissipation, love, however, paid a visit to his heart: — the lady unexceptionable; — the relations of each party upon amicable terms. He made no secret of his prepostef fion in her favour, and was encouraged to, hope she would one day be hjs j her father only prudently promising, that he would see what Mr. Blake would do for him, before he consented to the matter beina:
o
carried further than friendly visits: — which visits were little less than Spending their whole time together, and could not - sail of increasing their mutual approbation. Thus Smoothly did they glide on for four. successive years; when Tom having attained the period of three and twenty, began to press his father for the promised
^ mm
establishment; who with an agreeable Smile assuring him, everything stiould be fettled to his entire Satisfaction within the ensuing Six months, rendered our lover completely happy.

'vthe coxcbnib had ever affected to boast: of his great interest: with persons in power. — My lord duke was Spoke to upon the
occasion, and no doubt remained but that
0
Tom was born to be a great man. His • mistress’s father, delighted with the prospect of his daughter’s shining at court, redoubled his careltes of the young fellow, voluntarily telling him, “That the day ' “that put him in posteffion of such a “place as would fuit his purpose, stiould “put him likewise in posteffion of three “thousand pounds, and his fanny’s “hand.” What could be more flattering than his prospects I — My lord duke pustied with great vigour, — every hour was expected to bring welcome tidings; — and in order to be prepared to keep his word, the old fellow had Miss fanny’s clothes made, and held in readiness, But, alas! that day of happiness had never been enrolled in the book of Fate; — for, on returning one evening from visiting the young lady, and anticipating in idea the felicity that awaited him, he found a surly
R 4 fellow(
(
The HI s T o R Y of
\
fellow seated in his father’s hall, who roughly demanded his business.
provoked by his insolence, yet disdaining to answer him, he would have rustled into the parlour when an ugly Salute from the gruff meffenger’s club felled hirn to the ground, from whence he was raised only to learn the story of his ruined fortune, and fink again beneath that more
powerful blow.
<
The case was, that execution upon execution was out against his father, who I had thought proper to abscond that very afternoon with his wife lady, without giving him the flightest intelligence; — carrying off everything of value they could lay their hands on.
The kind of night he passed is much caster to be conceived, than described— — repaired early the next morning to the house of his mistress, in order merely to acquaint her with the cruel change he
had
 49
had experienced, and take a last farewell j for he was too sensible of her father’s turn of mind, to flatter himself, that any circumstance could compensate the loss of fortune, in his Sight. But the talk of revealing his unhappy fate was not reserved for himthe news had flown Swifter than love; and those very doors that were wont to open almost spontaneously at his approach, were now as strongly barricadoed against him, as if he had been a robber.
As he well knew the narrow soul he had to deal with, this shock was by no means So Severe as might have been expected; — but to lose Sight for ever of his beloved Fanny, the object of his tenderest affection, was not So easily born: — he, however, resolved, upon Some little recollection, never again to expose himself to so gross an indignity, but to Shun the face of every former acquaintance. He wrote to Oxford to his tutor, begging him to dispose of his books, furniture, and apartments to the best advantage; and after
discharging
250   :
I
discharging a few little bills, remit hiin the overplus immediately. This bufiness was Soon performed, though not at all to his satisfaction, as he had promised himself a much larger Supply than he found he was entitled to : — for ignorant as he was of every method of procuring a livelihood, and entirely friendless, he found his whole possessions did not exceed two hundred and Seventy pounds.
He took himself a little lodging, where despair was his only companion; — nor had he sufficient strength of mind to fix upon one Scheme of future provision. As he was musing late one evening in his chamber, with distraction, horror, nay, guilt in his heart, — for it had occurred to him, that his life was of no consequence to any one; — that he had a hand to execute, — and was entirely in his own power; — when the maid of the house, gently tapping at his door, delivered him a letter.
‘ The hand was not unknown to him; he broke the Seal, trembling with a variety
of
 51
of passions, and to his unspeakable asto nifliment, read that his Fanny waited in the parlour, until that note had prepared him to give her a welcome reception.
Half frantic with joy, he was flying to receive her; — but was prevented by a female figure that stood without the door, and in a low voice entreated him not to betray himself— — can guess your feelings, ” said she, “by my own; — but our prudence “is all we have at present to rely upon.”
They then Sat down to consult what step was most eligible, under their critical circumstances. She informed him, “That “one of her father’s servants having by “accident seen him in the street, and out “of mere curiosity traced him to his “lodging, had mentioned the circum stance only that very day in confidence “to the upper maid, who kindly revealed “it to her, though far from suspecting the ‘‘ consequence it was of to her, or the effect: it produced. — She Said, she had
“lono:
2^2
“long been clear in her resolution of “Sharing his fortune, if she ever was so “happy as to learn the place of his re“ “that she had brought away in “money and effects about three hundred pounds, which she considered as no less “his property than herself; — that their “engagement was not of such a nature “as to be dissolved either by misfortune, “or the prudential views of a father, who had no one reasonable objection “to offer; concluding with begging he “would think of leaving England with “all possible expedition.”
A
Poor Tom was So struck by this proof of her attachment, and So greatly affected by Some reflections upon the misery he Should reduce her to, by availing himself of her partiality and generosity, that he w’as unable to reply. She, who possesses an uncommon share of vivacity and good nature, rallied him upon his gloomy reception of an offer, that fly expected would have procured her many fine compliments;
. - — when,
ft
y
 53
— when, recollecting himself, and being abundantly convinced that Ihe could not return again to a roof sbe had abandoned 5 and from some other convictions, the propriety of which he had not leisure to confider, he at length yielded to the tide of joy that he had been labouring to stem, and all his soul was gratitude and love.
She had given hersels for his sister to the people of the house, and as Such was treated with great civility, during Some part of the next day, in which time he prepared a proper place to convey her to,, but judged it best to remain himself in his old lodging, to prevent suspicion.
ft
He inquired at the Jamaica coffeehouse for a passage in the first ship des tined for that island, and by the expira tion of that necessary period (or rather, what the new and extraordinary laws of this country require, previous to the performance of the marriage ceremony), met with one to his wish: : the third day after that event had taken place, em'

254
barked in high spirits with his lovely wifcj at gravesend j mutually flattering themselves, that they should leave every misfortune behind them.
But unhappily there was another difficulty in store for them, which they but
1
little apprehended; — they were wrecked a few leagues beyond the Nore, and with the utmost hazard escaped with their lives, and the little money they had in their pockets; their danger having been So extreme, that no one thought of anything but personal preservation. Unknowing what to • do in this exigence, and meeting with a conveyance, they had come to portsmouth, from whence Tom proposed working his passage to some of the new colonies, — and there establisbing himself in the best manner Providence should enable him. He had applied by the name of Brown to some persons in London, whom he knevr were acquainted with the necessary steps, and was waiting their answer with a great degree of impatience, when I became acquainted
 55
quainted with him, from the double apprehensions of his unprotected fltuation’s exposing him to being pressed on board a
ft
man of war (a circumstance his wife declared she could never survive), and the certainty that they were exhausting their little fund, without the least degree of probability of obtaining a fresh Supply; — but as they conceived a decent appearance would be their best Security, however cutting their reflections, they had perfisted to Support it, except Some intimations, which in the anguisb of his heart Tom had let fall, and had not escaped the observation of his landlady.
Such is   Tom Bristow, alias Brown, alias Briton; you cannot, therefore, be surprised to hear he found a tolerable friend in me. — I easily persuaded him to become a volunteer, as I promised to Support him with my friendsbip and interest.
Content
k
256
Content soon bid the roses resume their former Seat, and never was there a more pleasing or agreeable companion than the reanimated Fanny. — Her vivacity has frequently beguiled my misfortunes, and the Scheme 1 have So recently carried into execution, was entirely of her planning. To heighten the ridicule, Tom enlisted himself, on a vacancy happening, as drummer; which office he occupied one whole month before our return to England, when I civilly presented him with his discharge, having by the interest: of a friend of mine in Ireland (to whom I related the story of his misfortunes) obtained him a very genteel post in the Irish cus toms, to which country he is now repairing with all possible expedition. fanny’s father, overcome by ny intercessions (or rather by the all prevailing appointment his fon in law had procured) consented to receive a visit from his child (my reputed wife). He returned her with his blessing, and five hundred pounds in her pocket,
promising

promising from thenceforward to confider her, as her husband should continue

to de Serve.
You must and shall See them before they quit England, and to them I refer you for a more minute account of our plot: and I am certain you will acknowledge more amiable couple cannot exist.
\
He was formed by nature for the com mifiion I entrusted him with, as he was not only master of every necessary qualification, but loved a frolic at his heart. — Had we by any perverse accident failed in our design, and detedlion, instead of success, been the fruits of our labour; it would have been evident that no real evil could be intended the adorable Miss Kitty, as her lover was not only predisposed of, his wife attending on his every step, but most unquestionably in all his former conduct:, a man of true and nice honour. But as her whole punishment will depend upon the affair being kept a secret— — reflect with pleasure, that no one has been in the vol. II S smallest)

The His Tor y of
smallest respect: entrusted, but those who can be relied upon.
To this couple I owe every satisfaction I have So unexpectedly tasted; they have proved the indirect means of preserving me from the most dire destruction, in the person of my miss Pittborough; you will not, therefore, deny them the next place to her and you in my friendship and affection. I must add, that, notwithstanding I had not the least reason, to doubt the young man’s veracity, I So far acted
the suspicious part as to write to his tutor,
#
and some persons in London, to inquire
9
his family and character. From them I received many lights into his real merit, his modesty was far from communicating, as never mortal was more extolled for every valuable endowment, or more compalhon ated under misfortunes.

Another happy point gained I for I could not have exulted, if her peace had been destroyed. she informs me, that Sir matthew’s health is in a declining state. — I am a man, Ned, not an angelbut as pleafure’s cup is ever dashed with care, so this piece of intelligence is accompanied with most alarming accounts of Miss pittborough’s decay! — She is, alas, supposed to be far gone in a consumption.

HARK’E, Ned, I command you
to throw open your cellars, to cheer the hearts of your poor neighbours, — and let Tom, my Fanny, and yourself rejoice in the returning happiness of your friend! — happy beyond’the power or possibility of description!!
