TH E eafhsrn way of writing hath been justly admired in all ages. The bold metaphors and noble simplicity al most peculiar to the orientals add a lustre to their compositions, not to be rivalled jby the greatest orators of Greeee and Rome. those who are in the least conversant in the oriental languages can evince the truth of this; and even the English Reader may form fomo idea of their Sublime writings, by the tranjlation of the jcrip tiiresy which yet falls infinitely short of the divine original. The blooming fiow r of the eajl lose a great deal of their fragrancy and liveliness of colour, become more languid and Sickly, by being transplanted to the colder climates of the North, The Arabs justly claim the preeminence

eminence in polite writing among the eajiern nations : for a great number of excellent authors have flourished among them, wliose works are extant to this day. Arabia hath produced many renowned philosophers, mathematicians, poets, orators, historians and physicians, who were the envy of their owny and the admiration of future agesa This may partly be attributed to the * liberty they enjoyed above their neighbours; which, according to the Longinusy conduces very 
much to fine writing, and partly to the copiousness and purity of their language, which remains almost uncorrupted down to this time. 
I have, in the following pages, endeavoured to shadow out Some of the beauties of the original Arabic, and if I have Sailed in the copfy I hope the reader will pardon me, since the pidurc is almost inimitable, at least a very dissi i cult tash for an unexperienced hand. i

This illustrious Arabian was born osnobic parents, and had an education Suitable to his rank and quality, as we (hall See in the Sequel. 
His Sather, the renowned Hamid, was no icss famous for his knowledge and virtue, than he was for the loveliness of hia person, and his fiiill in the art of war; for he dedicated a great part of his time to the study of the Belles Letters, and the improvement of his mind, and united the ffkholar with the courtier and the general. His mother wras descended from the illustrious race of the Caliphs, and inherited all their virtues, tempered with a certain fostness peculiar to her sex. Her exquisite beauty chamied the eye like

Her eyes had a Sparkling vivacity, and darted innnmcrous rays on the behohers like the fun in his might, insomuch that (he was compared to one of ihr. daughters of paradije. Caflem wa the only child of this happy pair, and partici pated of the persedions of both, whether of body or mind. 
He was born at Lima, a city of Arabia selix, (now called Ayaoaao) situate on the Persian gulf, which is known at present by the name of the guls of balsora, and near the desart of elcatis. As for the exaq time of his birth, we have no certain knowledge of it, my author being Silent on this head. However, we may suppose it to be about the 316th year of the Hegira, or Mahometan ra, which answers to AC. 938. 
But for the Several circumstances of caffeniv^ fife, of which this is but a Short Jketch, theyh?" ' to be found at length in the history of Abdallah. fien ali, from whom we have extracted this ac .count of the time and place of his birth. Pie

further obsertes, that the inhabitants of Ayaman# especially those near the Persian guls, arc much more civilised than the Bedouins or wild Arabs, •who live on prey and rapine, moving their tents from place to place as it best Suits their cotl vcniency for pasturage and plunder. But these have a taste for arts and Sciences, dwell in cities and encourage trade and commerce, f this being the plcasatucst part of Arabia, and abounding with Spices and odours. During caffem’s insan cy he was attended by twelve of the Sairest of the daughters of the land at hi sather’s house, nd under the care and infpe^tion of his pother. Zeboide, (for that was her name) as he grew up, feasontd his Soul with the early love of virtue. She cheristied every good idea, and impressed it the more strongly on his mind; but timely eradicated, or at least checked the bad. The pure iinfullied mind is equally qualified to receive any ..j^mpreffions, like the unwritten page, and is apt to retain ihosc ideas it first receives during its

present, and perhaps future existence. Zeboide, with a joy which mothers only feel. Saw how greed ily he imbibed every precept; and how the first dawn oshis reason portended a strong and clear judgement, as the brightfiar osthe morning sore tells the approach of the dazzling lustre of thi fun. She never Suffered the tendrejfe of the mother to make her Sorget her duty to his noble part : for (he thought it not icss incumbent on a parent to cultivate and improve the mind of a child, than to nourish him with daily Sood, and to protect him from external injuries. 
When he arrived at the tenth year of his age, Hamid assembled all the wise men of Arabia, and out of them chosey« persons who were versed in all the learning of the eajl, to form the mind of young Gaffem, and to make him acquainted with the polite arts and Sciences; At the Sam time, he had an eye over him, and at proper intervals gave him all the instrudsions which, hist long studies, joined with a persed knowledge of the world, had made him master of. Under all these advantages, it is easy to imagine what great improvements a youth of caffem’s genius 
'and 
( ir) 
and capacity made. I stiall theresore pass over the occurrences that happened during the sollow years; only observing that he Spent that time without any interruption, ifi following the wisest men of the age in their researches aster truth. They conduced him through all the/a lyt inths of the creation. They Sunk to the centre, or ascended above thediars, beyond the vast circumscrence of nature, till they were lost in the boundless regions of immenjity. Hence they Sormed a great, but inadequate idea of the Supreme Being, and ended their Sublime inquiries in the adniiiration of his incomprehensible nature, and transcendent brightness. 
I am now j(s^y® author) going to relate an incident in cafsem’s lise, which, in my opinion, is no ways disadvantageous to the idea I have Sormed of this great man. For noble minds ari not inscnfible of the soster passions;; are rather the roost susceptible of love and friendfhip, as their sensations are quick and lively. It is an account of his amour with the lovely Selima, whose death, which happened about the nineteenth year of his age, put a period to his love; 
B the 
( 6) 
the origin and cause of which vere as lollows^i In his childhood he entertained a particular esteem for one of the twelve virgins that attended him, which still increased with his years. This Sair Arabian was descended from an ancient family, and surpalted all the daughters of the east in everything that coirld render her amiable in the eyes of the other Sex, or excite the jealousy and envy of her own. Her body was Sormed \vith the exaftest Symmetry to charm the eye y whilst the harmony of her voice ravistied the ear. Add to this the beauties of her mind, and her taste for the bel/es Letters, which was infinitely Superior to that of the generality osher Sex. For file had been instrufiled in virtue aust philosophy from her infancy. Her sather’a fortune was reduced by repeated losses at Sea, and a numerous family; for he had ten Sons and twenty daugh' ters. Selima and her parents parted with great reluftancy ob' imlv Sides; but the liarrowness of their Sortane, and the kind? invitation of the noble Hamid, obliged her to do it, at least Sora time, till Ibrahim (for that was her sather’s name) should in Some measure repair the breaches cans 
J( 
() 
pd By cruel chance. caftem, who at .first was charmed with the swectness of her temper, and her tenderness to him during his insancy, as he grew acquainted with reason and philosophy, doubled his esteem for the lovely maid when he perceived the nobler beauties of her mind. Zeboide was So pleased with selima’s conversation, that live begged of her to continue at hamid’s house, aster the other .virgins were discharged. selima’s gratesul Soul could not deny So easy a request, as (he had always met with the kindest usage In hamid’s Samily, and had cantrafted a great esteem for his Son, who was now in the Sixteenth year of his age. caisem was overjoyed at this proposal;; the Sear of being deprived of the agreeable companj’’ of this lovely virgin, by her quitting Cima, had given him an iineafiness nnselt besore. By this means caftem had sre quent opportunities osseeing and conversing with 'his beloved Selima, at his hours of recreation, svhich he generally Spent in her company, Zeboide was not appt ehenfiye of the consequence of those interviews; for Ihe attributed his love and ^t^findernefs to a childisti fondness, which he had 
^oatraisicd 
( 8) 
contracted from his insanqy; and was pleased to see this early instance of castem’s gratitude. Selima appeared more amiable in his eyc8 every day; though he could not account for the growing passion: : he looked upon it as an esteem for her learning and conversation, and never could attribute it to love, which insensibly stole upon him. Alas! how difficult a thing it is for man to know his own heart, or the latent fpftngs and causes of his own happiness or misery. Selima, who was more advanced in years and experience, easily perceived his love, but caresully diffenstled her own : for the flame was reciprocal. She theresore Summoned all her philosophy to her assistance, in order to check the course of this little Jlream, which, without proper care and prevention, would increase into a Surious torrent, that Sorces its way through all obstacles, and bears down every Scrupulous thought besore it. She osten entertained young Caflem with lating the pernicious effedis of love; how it ei ' ervates the mind, and hinders it in its pursuit C philosophical inquiries. But this, instead of abating, increased the flame j for he was charip 
'' €d 
( 9) 
ed with the greatness osher soul, the strength of her reasoning, and the justness of her Sentiments. 
Gafiem and Selima were in this doubtsul Situation for three years, without coming to an echirdtjfement, though they had frequent opportunities to discover their Sentiments to each other; for they met every day, about Sunset, in a «vro« grove, on the banks of the river that flows by Lima, and waters the neighbouring gardens with its winding meanders. The limpid stream formed Several murmuring cascades, and the Sanning %e phyrs bore fpicey odours on their wings, and ivftjpered whence theyflok them. The Seathered choir joined in the concert, and completed the harmony. This was the Scene where the lovers met to communicate their thoughts to each other. Philosophical points were commonly the Subject of their conversation, which he discussed with great judgement, and a becoming gravity. 
"Selima was all attention to his Surprising discoveries, and every truth came mended from Caffends tongue. On the other hand, pftlofophy in So Sair a Sorm to him appeared doubly amiable; for (he Softened the Severer studies with a peculiar grace, 
and 
( JO) 
and strewed the path to virtue with the flowers of rhetofte. Perfuqfion dwelled on her lips, and honey flowed in every harmonious accent of her tongue. He never interrupted her discourse, but was al ways extremely attentive; till at last her virgin modesty would check her freedom, and make her stop stiort : — For (he thought it imprudent to engross the conversation to hersels; especially as (he looked upon it as her greatest happiness to hear his stronger reasonings, the result of hi? closer application, and masculiue judgement. 
Thus the happy Caflem and his beloved sell ma continued in this mutual intercourse of the sublimest friendstiip Sora considerable time; till at last an untimely Sat Snatched the beauteous Selima, in her early blpom, and in the Space of one hour Separated them for ever. Alas! how precarious is human happiness 1 How fleeting are the joys! how transitory the pleasures of the Sons of men! — The all wise Allah has given us a' ^ mixture of pleasure and pain in this world, in order to make us aspire to the happier climes of pa. radife, whok ]ojs are unfading, and vvhose inhabitants are immortal. We must not therefore 
think 
( ”) 
think oursclves fixed or fettled in this present state; it is rather a cara’uanferah where we must take up with numberlcss inconveniences, and meet with many rugged difficultiee in our way to the lowers of blifr, our happier and more durable Seat. 
It unsortunately Sell out one evening, that the unhappy Sdima, according to appointment, came first to the citron grove, and happened unwarily to walk among the arowai/v reeds, which grew very thick by the river fide. She was unmindsul of the danger of Srcquenting Such places; her mind being wholly taken up with the thoughts of Seeing her beloved Caffem. It is well known that Arabia abounds with seraphs, or winged serpents, which are Speckled, or of Several colours, but not very large : they love Sweet Smells, and frequent Such trees at, bear Spices, and the marsties where the cajjia and aromatic reed grows. The Arabians cover themstlves with fliins, and burn fsjrax when they gather the cajfia, in order to defend themsclves from these Serpents; for theif

Venom is So averse to the animal economy, that It destroys the principles of lise in a Sew minutes, by coagulating the blood, and abrading the solids. Selima, by the rustling of the reeds, routed up one of these serpents, which stie no Sooner Saw, but (he Selt a fatal wound in her Snowy arm. She started back — but it was too late to elude the winged death. The Subtle poison Soon insedied fluids, and (hook every fibre in the beauteous frame; which threw her into Such an ^gony> that Ihe could no longer Support herfels. Stic Sell down languid and pale, like a blooming flower that is blasted by Some balesul dew, and droops to rise no more. A heavy torpor Seized the extremities of her body, but had not as yet reached the vital parts; for (he still retained the fense of her present misery — and Sormer happiness. She was in these dreadsul circumstances when Calfem repaired to the usual rendezvous. Ashe approached the place, he Snw the Sair^ Arabian stretched on the ground, which made hinr start back with horror; — but recovering himself, he advanced, and Sound her just expiring; and Soon, too Soon, perceived the Satal

tause. Words Cannot express the griet that harrowed the wretched caltcm’s Soul. It was too big for vent. -- All the love and tenderness 
which he had besore concealed, and hardly understood, notv rulhed upon his tortured mind at once, and checked his Saultering tongue. At last his Sorrow forced utterance, and embracing her in his arms, while he bathed her with a flood of tears, he thus Spoke : “Alas! my dear Southeast 
lima! ’tis (he 1 Art thou gone Sorever? Shall the fineerest friendstiip, the purest love that ever warmed a human breast exist no more? witness heaven! that I would willingly die ** to Save thy precious lise, which now like a dying lamp quivers on a point just ready to leave its “lovely mansion— — a briny torrent intcr rnpled his Speech. — Thrice the lovely virgin assayed to Speak, and her last struggle gave her utterance. She held up her dying hand, and whilst her eyes overflowed with tenderness, Ihe thus Spoke in broken accents; “Farewell Sorever! — My Soul “hovers about thee as loath to quit its hold I hasten to the immortal bowers of paradise ** are prepared for the lovers of virtue. 
C unless( 
() 
“unless ow, the fineerest, tenderest lo’oe for Caflem be a crime." — Here her Speech Sailed her, the purple Jlream of llse ceased to flow, and the icy hand of death closed her eyes. caflem’s grief was So great that he could not quit the breathless corfe, and the house being at Some distance, he in vain called for Some help; till at last one of the eunuchs, who was sent to call him to his studies, Saw this mournsul Scene, and alarmed the house. Caflem stifled his gries as much as possible, In order to conceal his love; bat Hamid and Zeboide easily perceived the difle.m blcd flame, notwithstanding all his efforts to the contrary, but out of a good-natured tenderness seemed to overlook it. Selima was much lamented by Zeboide, and all who had the happiness of her acquaintance, and was interred with decent pomp. 
eaffem’fr grief gradually abated by a close application to his studies, and his conversation with preceptors about the government of the pas fions. pftlofophy almost entirely engrossed hia mind; which, together with the loss of the lovely Selima, made him kf&fufceptible of the Softer 
passions( 
() 
passions than he had been heretofore. The latter gave him a more melancholy cast of mind, and made him more Inclined to (hades and Solitude; however, he thought himsels very happy in enjoying alternately the company of the wifejl f men, and the befl of parents,. 
He continued in this Situation till Hamid thought he was arrived to years of maturity, and that the conduct of his lise might be lest to his own judgement, which now discovered itsels in the justness of his thoughts, and the uncommon strength of his reasonings. The ages were of the Same opinion, and Srankly owned that he was capable of no further improvements from their instrikstions. 
Being now arrived at the twenty jirjl year of his age, he was lest to follow the hent of his own genius. He closely pursued his studies in a country retirement, (which he had made choice of) about a parafang from Lima, wejlerly towards the deserts of Elcatif. He Soon got the reputation of a great pftlofopher, and was called Cajfem the Wife; which name is fresh in the memory of the Arabs to this day. His love of 
Solitude 
( *6) 
fplitude made him prefer this little retirement to the noisc and hurry of the town; however he repaired to Lima every day, in the cool of the evening, to visit \d\%pqrents, and to communicate his new discoveries to his father Hamid. He went on for Several years in this way of lise, giving and receiving the most; exquisite pleasure; a pleasure which none can be sensible of, but those who have experienced the inexpreffiblc delight accruing from a true discharge of the du. tics osparent and child, and from pursuing light and truth to their Source. 
But alas! — this happiness yvas too great to be of any longer continuance. The bitter cup of Sorrow allayed the Sweets of the unhappy cas fem’s lise once more : for Hamid and his lovely consort resigned their breath within the Space of one moon, and lest hirp, notwithstanding all his philosophy, almost inconsolablc. 
Having discharged the last offices to his de ceased parents, he quitted Lima, and confined stimfels entirely to his rural retirement, where he spent the remainder of his days. His gries gradually wore off, nd every boisterous paffiop 
subsided( 
() 
Subfidcd by the force of reason and philosophy. He at last acquired Such a Serenity and calmness of mind, that he applied himsels almost wholly to reveries and meditations, without perplexing him fcls too much with the Severer studies. He osten made little excurstons into the deserts of Elcatif, in the cool and dewy evening, and made the fi lent mom the witness of rhapsodies. The works of nature were osten the Siibjeft of hii contemplation, from which he gradually ascended to the Great Creator, and concluded with praise and thanksgiving to the all wise Architect of the stupendous uniyerse. 
Though he lived for many years in this retirement, (which grief and his love of Solitude brought him to) Sar from the conversation of men; yet he was quite averse to those who, out of philofopftck pride and arrogance, hate or de fpise the human fpedes. He still retained the tender Sentiments of Sympathising humanity, which are inseparable from a great and generous mind. The Sollies of mankind moved neither his hatred nor disdain; but he endeavoured to irai tistc the Great Author of our hhg, who extends 
( i8) 
tends his mercy to all his creatures, though infi filtcly below him; and rather pities than derides their numerous foibles : in Short, he was So accustomed to philosophical contemplations, that his thoughts were in a manner Spiritualized; insomuch that the neighbouring (hepherds took him for one of the spirits of paradise, who arc disen gauged from matter; or, at least, one that con versed with the genii. Indeed his venerable aspect made him appear Something more than hu man j and by his goodness and benevolence, he seemed little inferior to \dxokguardian genii, who are constantly employed by the Supreme Being for the good of mankind. 
Although Caflem was a great admirer of the Works of nature; yet his speculations were not confined to material obje3s, the intellectual world being often the subject of his prosoundest contemplation. He observed with admiration, that he immaterial soul operated on an organised body, and received all its pleasure and pain by the Senses;; as the great Allah and his holj prophet had promised eternal happiness to all true mujfulmans, * he could not conceive how the nakea 
soul 
( o) 
soul could relisti the pleasures of paradise. He thought it more than probable that immaterial be trigs communicated their thoughts to each other; but whether it was by discourse or mtutdton; or whether they had any other inlet to happiness, different from the corporeal senses, he could not determine. This excited his curiosity, and Set him upon a striker inquiry into the nature of the rational soul. — The pleasures of paradise, according to the Mahometan religion, Seemed to be adapted to the grosser Senses;; as flowery lawns and waving woods, Sunny hills and stiady grottoes, bubbling Springs, warbling birds, fields eternally green, and Spicy odours wasted by Sanning zephyrs. these were to regale the Souls of just men while they caressed the daughters of paradise, who being divinely Sair, immortal, and blessed with perpetually renewed virginity, were to complete their happiness. 
Caflem, whose Sentiments were elevated and Sublime, thought these pleasures by no means adequate to the vast desires of an immortal Soul 5 at least a Soul like Ms, whose thirst aster kpow ledge was insatiable. However, the deserence 
he 
( 20) 
he always (hewed to the holy prophet made himi conclude this might be Some part of the pleasures of paradise;; the Sublime idea he had Sormed of the Supreme Being induced him to believe, that the infinitcly wife and good Creator had In store other pleasures more adapted to the nature of immaterial beings, to consuramate the felicity of good men in a future state. theresore from the constderations of the goodness and omnisci enee of the Deity, and the strong desire aster knowledge he experienced in himsels, he could not help thinking that the gratification of that dejire must be the chies ingredient in the happiness osparadife. these reflections led him into a labyrinth too intricate for his most abstrafled and busy thoughts. He Sormed many curious hypotheses and wild conjeflurcs : but all could not satissy his wavering mind. He osten prayed to the great Allah to cast a beam of light on his Soul, and irradiate his glimmering conceptions. He longed to pry into the intellectual system, and earnestly willed that one of the winged Spirits would vouchsase to descend from the empyreum and Ihcw him the mysteries of the otherworld 
The 
( 2i) 
The omniscient Allah (Says my author) who never slumbers nor steeps, and whose ears are always open to the prayer of the pure, untainted, mind, heard his request, and Sent one of the winged meffengefs who always stand besore. his throne to satissy his doubts, and calm his Soul. The heaven born mestenger, quick as lightning, darted from besore the throne to obey his high behests : for those benign spirits that are Sent to Succour and relieve the good and virtuous, for greater dispatch, are begirt with a thousand wings; whereas those that execute vengeance otl the wicked having but ten wings are not So Swift in their flight through the fields of ather. The genius lighted on the top osa mountain near Lima, and altumed the Sorm of a venerable old mani Here he waited for an opportunity to address the happy caftem, who now approached the place immersed in thought and contemplation on the works of nature. His mind was gradually elevated, till he was lost in a thousand sruitless inquiries about the fpiriitual world, and the state of departed Souls. The genius perceived the perplexity of his mind; for fpiritualfeittgs can easily 
D discern( 
() 
discern the thoughts of men without the help of discourse, either by the outward lineaments of the body, or the different modifications of the soul, or both together. I cannot (continues my author) give a more lively description of this happy interview than in caffem’s own words, which arc as follows. 
Evening Meditation ben hamidy being an emblematical de -- Jcription of the Refurreflion. 
* T Was walking, a Sew nights ago, over the ‘ hills in the western and unsrequented paths 
* of the city of Lima, which looks towards the ‘ desert of elcatis, in order to resrelh mysels after 
* the studies of the day. As I grew tired with 
* walking, I Seated mysels on the head of one of 
* the highest among that verdant range osmoun 
* tains, and gave mysclf up to a profound con 
* on the works of the Great Creator, 
* which at that time presented themselves to my 
* view in the most charming prospc£s imaginable : 
* the height of the place, the fitness of the sea 
* 
( 23) 
* fon, and the majesty and Solemn nity of the (hades, 
* which were then Silvered over with bright ‘ moon stiine, Spread through my Soul a tranquillity not to be Selt, but by a mind free from ‘ guilt, and raised by the raptures osreligion and ‘ devotion. On the one hand of the Summit where ^ I sat, the town appeared buried in Sleep and 
* silence, and produced in my heart those tender 
* overflowings oscompaffionate humanity, which, ‘ arc natural to a generous mind : on the other 
* fide the desert of elcatis extended its wide, un 
* cultivated dimensions;; by the vastness and 
* ruggedness of the landscape struck my imagina 
* with a kind of pleasing horror. I could 
* observe nothing throughout its Savage wastes 
* but caverns and precipices, broken recks and 
* mountains, hollow vales, Sandy plains, and gloo 
* my Sorcsts, with which it was covered. At the ‘ Soot of the hill the river which watered Lim^ 
* flowed along in a Serene calm, whose waves ‘ Seem to murmur in their steep, and nod gently 
* to the Shore. Over my head the Iky shone 
* a lively blue, whence the beautisul empress ^ of the night dispenfed her influences, and the 
. ‘ stars 
( H) 
* stars twinkled round her throne, like So many ‘ diamonds in an arch osfapfire. In a word, the 
* place, the season, and the objc6i of my medi^ 
* tation, all conspired to fix my thoughts, and ^ kindled in my bosom the flames of an holy 
* transport. As I melted away in these delights, 
* I could not help imagining, that the Same em 
* I was then pleasing mysels with, bore 
* Some analogy to ihose, which regale the depatt 
* ed Spiiits of good men. O Caflem! (Said I ‘ to myscls) do not the inhabitants of paradise ‘ thus admire the works of God? Does not the 
* harmony of their praises rove through the bow ‘ ers of bliss, and Soften the murmurs of the 
* streams of lise? Are they not overflowed with 
* a flood osjoy, when they Search the lahyritnths 
* of creation, and range through the dominions ‘ of the Supreme Being? Methinks I behold 
* them listing up their admiring eyes, from the ‘ fields green with an eternal flburifh, and with ^ strengthened and enlarged ken, penetrate into 
* the remotest parts of ather. They view the 
* •vdixiow^ systems that comppfe the umverfe; their ‘ iniellecis are stretched and crowded with ample

* my thoughts grew warmer, and fired by de ‘ grees, 2. philofoptical thought, which had often 
* perplexed roe, and which I did not find easy to ‘ answer, started a srefh to ray mind. How (Said ’ I to mysels) can the Spirits of paradise, stripped

* and indulgent climates P How will the 
* naked Soul be able to behold the wonders of

* mortal eyes behind them? Or how can they be ‘ ravistied with a concert of warbling birds, rill 
* streams, and bubbling fountains, without

* While I was losing myscls in these inquiries, ‘ I Saw a man sitting on the head of a mountain, 
* and at Some distance, who with a look dawn 
* with celestial love, and a voice Sull of majesty called me up : caltem, (Said he) draw ‘ near; be attentive to what I utter. cease to 
* perplex thy mind with the unsearchable mystc ‘ rics of our world. Know thus much — I am

* and darkness intercepts the light of it — asture 
* thysels, thou Son of Hamid, that the unembo ‘ died spirits amongst us are persedlly holy and

( 27) 
‘ happy beyond thy glimmering conception

This mwfiufcftpt Was found among castem^s papers aster his deccasc, written in letters of gold. The original is preserved with great veneration to this day; as it contains a treasure of natural and moral knowledge, which the Arabians were 
E entirely 
{ 30) 
entirely ignorant of besore. • Castem ia theresore reckoned but little inserior to the great Zoroaster, for his learning and knowledge, or to one of the prophets, for his piety and Sandlity. 
aster this agreeable vision, he Spent the remaining part of his lise in case and tranquillity of mind, and in preparing himscls for the happier climes of paradije, which he considered as approaching nearer, as his strength gradually decayed. He departed this lise in the 70th year of his age. He quitted the beauteousof a well spent lise with a gracesul .• for he met his Sat, with an heroich constancy, and a great ness of mind almost peculiar to himsels. He Serenely Smiled at the approach of death; for his soul longed to be on the wing, and to quit her earthly mansion, not without the comsortablc hopes osbeing reunited one day. 
He was greatly lamented by all the wise men of the east, as his death was an irreparable loss to the commonwealth of letters. Castem enjoyed an uninterrupted state of health, and a vigorous old age. No violent passions rustled his mind; no dtfeafe racked his body. He was a stranger to 
intemperance 
r 31) 
intemperance and debauchery, to anger and revenge, which are the latent causes of almost all the pain and uneafiness incident either to body or mind. Nevertheless he always exp rested a compassionate. Sympathising tenderness for his fellow-creatures, zwa pitied those miseries he never felt. He was equally ayerse to nrroroseness, epicurean gaiety, andjloic apathy, taa word, he assted agreeable to the didiates of right reason, and the laws of the Great Creator. He'confidered his^o/? in the umverfe, the Several relations he bore to other beings, and saithsuliy discharged the duties incumbent on them, in order to preserve that universal harmony, by which all things fubfist. In h im were united the nrosoundest lofophy with the greatest affability, chearsnlness and good nature. He was equally qualified Sora hermitage or a court; though he had riot the morose severity of the nor the trifling levity gs the other. I cannot conclude this imperseft Jketch of the illustrious eastern’s lise with a nobler euhgium than that, which Abdallah'bcn alt gives this great Man : “He Was a friend to himself, 
a friend to mankind, and a friend of God.^’

I Hope it will not be thoiight impertinent her to Subjoin a Translation oscastem’s Letter to Helim, his late preceptor. It was written a Sew days besore his death, and contains his most private Sentiments, w’hich he Sreely unbosoms to hia friend; for it Seems he always had a tender regard for Helim, and communicated his thoughts to withless reserye than to any of his preceptors. We may, in the Sallowing letter, trace the sublimest friendship, cemented by gratitude, virtue and philosophy; and Samiliarized by the oriental (itnplicity. Helim lived to a very great age, and Survived Caflem a Sew months, whole loss he deplored to the day of his death. 
To the illustrious Helim, the wisest of men, the favourite of Allah, the mirror of know“ “who knows the power of Simples, and the influences of the moon and stars, the instruflor of the ignorant, and the delight of the eyes, the most hurabk of his Slaves, and the roost“

“Deign, O ijelim 1 to leave thy fublimerstu * dies for awhile, and to peruse a few lines “which thy Caffem lays at thy feet : Deign to accept the grateful odours of an humble Jlotver which was planted by thy hand, and watered ‘ with the fragrant dew of thy lips.
