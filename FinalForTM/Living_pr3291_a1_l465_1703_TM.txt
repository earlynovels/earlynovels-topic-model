The Matters Treated of, are fb Obnoxious to every one’s Cognizance, and brought into their Remembrance by Such late Occurrences, that they have no Trouble flung upon their hands to 
Consult History, or have Recourse to Times long past, to explain the 
Meaning of "em. As for the De

not a Soul but what is under adi fturbance for late Disappointments, and the Recovery of the Church arty in their former Esteem, will find Fault with them, they presume, on that account. 
But as for their Sins both of 0^ mijfion and commiijimy to peak in thelanguage of Some people who will be Angry with them, they are Manifoldy yesl Multifarious; The Authors have theirs, the bookseller ought to be call d in question for hisy and they question not but from theperufal of his own, the Printer will not be angry if he comes in for a Share of the buh lick Censure.

Though the same vro^idence that Seems to acquit the bu linels at Cadi., comes in for their Justification and they that had been undone for Fortune teller^ but for thclnckyaccident at Figo, would have been almost in the same Condition with those that came from it, but they wanted Courage to come in for part of the blunder.

Tihefecond, which is the sook feller^ whom Authors are Tender of Disobliging, Should have his Faults too made known to the 
^uhlicky but they may have oc calion for hini again, and Men of his ^rofej/ion are often Serviceable to 'em, wherefore they leave him to the Mercy of his Jury, and whatever Twelve Honest Men Shall Decide in his Favour, they Shall be Joyful to Acquiesce in it. 
The third and lasty which is the Printery Should be left to the same Treatment, but the Reader will think 'em Partial from the many Erratas which abound in the Body of this Volume, Should they speak him Guiltlelswhat they have to say in his Behalf, is,

It might be expected that they ^ should plead Guilty for some al £5, and cry ^eccapimm^ that they Should fall Foul on those that have Written after the Same Method before em, and are now 
Busted in writing after em, but those that Read "em for that pur pose will find themselves Mistaken, and whatever ^roevoccui^ ons Some amongst the Bookfelling Trade may have given em, it is

To Instance in one articular; if these Letters in General have not that Poignancy of Wit, as Some that have been in the refs these Twelve Months last past, they are less Obvious on account of their Title to the ^uhlick 3^ marks^ stnce it s Something more easy to make the Lining episto lize one another, than to have a

For feme years fence one of the Elect but noli? under a State of Reprobation. 
I 
‘ ^ : f ' '... 
Right worf)ipful Knight and Alderman, 
Having heard of your disappointment, 
and the Concern you lie under for the illsuceeli of your late Negotiations in the City; I could not but think myself oblig’d as a Spiritual adviser to adstiini ster fbme Confblatory Phy lick to you, in order to keep you from despair that are the very Head, Heart and Lungs of the Partji which would Soon lose the Name 
B of 


of being Somd, Should excels of Grief impair your Constitution, or your accustom’d Health give way to the approaches of Melancholy which is it’s greatest e nemy. 
Take heart of Oak, I say, as Several of your Brethren have done before you, and for this once SI beseech you no more for the sake of Godliness) Set before you the Example of those who have Chiefly oppos’d you., For Instance, how often has Sr. S — D — d been repuls’d in his Attempts at the Mayoralty in the late Ileign? How many have jump’d p’rehis Head and left him below the Chair? yet neither has he defisted from his pre tenfions, nor been fb inconsiderate in his Refblves as to give himself up for lost, or to reflgn his Claim of Rights to am Honour, which his Continuance in opposing us in all Probability will one day advance him/to. 
Sir Jonathtin R — indeed like a Man of more Phlegm than Judgement, more Passion than Politics, flung off his Gown, and bid you chide whom you would to ride a horfe back with the 
I. ■.. • 
Brotherhood, for his Part he would h^ve no more Conversation with a Body of Sinners, that neither stood up for old 
Laws, 
j 


«• 
«* :. _ nor were Observers of old Customs in giving the Precedency to the ' eldest Alderman. But this Gentleman was much in the wrong of it as to his favouring the Church Party by it. They lost a Member by the Bargain, while as i take it, Sir would be thought feme Body, jumped into his Pdace, and strengthened ours by the Accestion of a Member who was never backward in talking for usj ' but as busy as a Bee, and a perpetual Advocate and Solicitor for us and the Government than in being. 
Oh! Comfort yourself dear sird ^ with the Success that attends his Accom 
^ Lite 
plilhments, and abate of your Sorrows for your own loss at the thoughts of his Advancement. Perfeveranee^ yea, an ob ftinate Perfiveranite m the Faith which you have hitlierto bravely adher’d to, in the doitfmek you and your worsbipfus Brethren have approv’d of from my liiouth, and attested your thanks in Print for; in the you have formerly 
been ajstickler for: This invaluable Gift 
of Per sever ance^ will change Matters for the better, and in time fb alter the very Constitution of things So as to bring ’cni bnee more to your Purpose 
B s If 


'\ If you would Suffer a Man that has eaten Cuffard for Some years last: past with the Mayors of London for being Master of ins imomf/trahle Receipt this grand Elixir for Men of fbber Intellectuals, ^ to advise you, I say, if you will take honest Jofbms word, who never took any Parishioners' ' was always for the ready Penny, not a Preshription in the world is able to Vie th this refreshing Cordial : This obstinate and ir refistable Draught of Perjeverance will accomplish your Expectations, 'and bring you to the Poffcstion of what you are at present to Seek for.) 
Think of me. Sir, for I imagine I make no inconsiderable Figure in the world both in my Intellectual, and perfbnal Appearance, * if it had not been for this wholefbme Doctrine I had as fbon jostled myself into an archiepil copal See, as had this piece of Lutestring hanging down each fide of me,, I durst, have Sworn ray namesake of gre/bam couedge^ that instead of handling scotch cloth, now fall’s a Shaking of Urinals had been a Prince to me, evsh in his first Occupation, were it not for my Permanence and Constancy in pursuit of those Refqlutions, which I always follow’d and adher’d to. Had

Had I ne’re oppos’d Passive Obedience never preach’d up for reftbmg the Powers, never stood to my Text in decrying the very Ordinances of a Chiirch, I % was a pretended Member of; never continued stding with the Enemies of the Hierarchy, nor oppos’d the Divine Authority of Kings at the Same time as I own’d ' one whole Authority was question’d, '' of God's Appointment', where had been my Gifts and Admirers, my Tankards and Silver Spoons, my Fiocho and Title of D. D. to stamp an Imprimatur on my Sermons; my Recommendations as Chap' lain in Ordinary to the Society of reform mers, my lebmes and Preferments? 
Alas nowhere 1 I tremble to think of it, 
I must have written myself another Luke Millbourn, AA carry’d all the Tokens of my high deserts in being a plaiofm^ 
tev of the Church of England 
But now it comes in my Head, the Ministers who then Sat at the Helm were all, or for the Generality, Gentlemen of my own Principles, I withstood no Persecutions *, was afraid of no Fire or Faggot, and had no Martyrdom in View to put me out of Love with the Doctrines 
I made Such a Stir about, So that it’s no 
■ / 
great matter whether I insist any more 
B ^ on. ♦ 

on myself for an Example of that Excellent Virtue which I have propos’d to 
yourctmitation and Practice. 
We that are Dispensers of the Word, and fell Divinity by Eetale, must have fbrae regard to our Bodies as well as Souls, and I Shall not deviate from mofi of my Brethren the Clec: ^yj if I keep a little Mental Refervadcri to myself, and make my Court to the Religion that has now got the upper hand of us; iflpre tendedly join with those People that stand up for the Decency of wear mg the, ’ Surplice aild praistng the Lord with loui 
tuned. Infiruments: I may come to be a bi stiop by those means, and theii, Sir, you, cannot but know, that the greater Figure I make in the Church, I am enabled, and have it in my Power to do the greater harm. I can stilt under the Rose advise with hir’d Constables, give a Blesting to the Righteous undertakings of Informers, and converse Secretly with the Disaffected that are remov’d from the Lieutenancy, notwithstanding all this; and my Hypocrisy will infallibly be of more Service to the Cause, than my Integrity., since I disgrace the Church esta blifh’4 by taking it’s Habit, and reading 
it s Liturgy, only to serve myself. And. 


I widen the Divisions that are form’d against her, by the private Cabals I enter into with her rnost profess’d Enemies. 
But you, Most honour’d Patron, arc. arriv’d at your Zeiiith of Power, and your Wealth So prodigiously great can Icarce Suffer an Increase, as you Act in another Sphere; lb your Actions may have a quite contrary Motion. You that are Equal to the greatest Nobleman now Living, may take the same Liberty, and publicly Show your self a murmurera Republican; a Smalh Beer Churchman, a Predestinarian or what you please, and though you have not been preordain’d to Serve in Parliament for the Year 1702, may keep to your old cut Sleeve appearance, and stand up for Doctrines you have strenuously asserted in fbme Reigns. 
Success is not always the Attendant of the Wife, nor is the best Man breathing certain to; be Fortunate in ev’ry Undertaking; your wor^ip had your Share of the blind goddefte’s Distributions, and you are not to Repine at the Discontinuance of her Favours. St. Jufimy A * quimsy and the rest of the father’s and Schoolmen, give Advice to the contrary. Perhaps, you’ll say, what are the father’s 


and Schoolmen to a Son of Pen, Ink and Parchment? Or what Communion is there between a rich Man, and a parcel of Lean hungry Cameiions that liv’d upon the Air of Faith, and were of a Religion contrary to what you make Profession of? Upon my Veracity, I forgot, Sir, they were 
Papists, mere down right Sons of Antichrist; but forgetfulness I hope, is not among the unpardonable Sins, if it was, woe be to me, that have often forgot my ' self to be a Church of England Man, nay fbmetimes a very Christian, and to go farther, have forgot that I had a W — at home, which is the hardest thing postible 
to be forgotten; and which is a Mans 
LA / 
chtefest Remembrancer, a njiidst the disputes which I held amomzst the Females for their Conversion and admiffton into the Congregation of [! rue Believers. 
But I need not enfhrce the Doctrine of 
4 
Perfsvermce any longer to a Gentleman of your Kidney and Persuasion;; refer you to Baxter and Bmiyan^ to put you in Mind of the Cause you areembarqu*d in, and which, must inevitably be cast away without your utmost Endeavours who sit at the, Helm to preserve it You are the Hopes of the Party; though you have lately been baulk’d of your own 


Expedations; the very Brutus of the re public to Establifli it upon it s wonted Foundation. 
it’s agreed by all Hands, that Riches are the Sinews of War, and they must be expended when the common Necest ficies require it. Open your Heart, your 
Heart then and^wear puyy^r.zuri^ firings, by continually drawing em. A Bond or two will do the Bulinefsj^ and half of one of your deepest Mortgages will bring things infallibly to bear against the next Election. Whisper about your charitable Intentions by your emissfary*s tell em you’ll build Pallaces like a certain Brother of yours, and keep to our old Maxim, that Treats make the most pro felytes, and 111 lay ray personage to an 
Assembly s Catechism, that we shall get t 
the Day at the first opportunity. 
In the mean time, whether IF ovfeab amongst the Society of Reformers whether 1 whisper Sedition at dicps or Gar rawa/s, whether I am made chair man at a Christening or Marriage • or put on a Melancholy appearance, as chief Comforter to the disconfblate at a Burial; the Sum of my Difeourfe shall be rending towards the Promotion of your Temporal Concerns, as for those that are Spi *

'dobor, 
f FTER my Thanks for your Ad x\ vice, and the Concern you leeni to have for my not being Elected, I cannot but lend you word I have long since been Master of that Obstinacy, you take upon you to prelcribe to me; and frorn the Day of my C — — mor the Night which you please, to this very Minute, have done nothing that, made the least Appearance to the contrary. I begun to hare King Charles the Second from the fir st hour, I heard he was in Love with 
my W" —, and ask any one that has had 
any 
/ * 
ft 
t 

any knowledge of me since, if I have not continued it down, to thole that bear his Name to this very Day. I told the parson of the Parish where my Country house stands, who came to Condole with me t’other day, that he was Bopiflily affected for offering to Speak in the Praise of the Religion that has got the Uppenhand, and if I had not been afraid the Fellow 
*' • I r 
would have complain’d, and made me ' leave my Estate behind me, would have laid as much of the Queen; but I had the Gift of Continence and I thank my own Prudence for it, I can tell over my Money every day, and whatever Shift I have made to get it, can say Poffestion is eleven Points of the Law, and have Courage enough to affirm, that I came honestly enough by it, and that ev’ry individual piece of Money is my own. 
Certainly good Doctor, your Reverend Noddle is fbmething forgetful, and you have been troubled with a Vertigo in the Brain, or you might remember what a Bustle I made about the City Charter, what Caballs I form’d against: the qm wttrrtintoy not out of Love to the City; for your Man that designs to be Rich can Love no one but himself; but out of perfect Hatred to the King 


who then reign’d; and how busy I was to Form Parties against the Court Interest. King James had no more of my Affections than his Brother, and I was fb violent in my Difbbedience to him, that my Brother fvarti and I thought it high time to cross the Water; and vi sit Hogan Mogan to eat Sea cod and Pickled Herring, lest our Mouths Should be put out of Taste here, or rather for fear our Heads Should have been exalted amongst the brethren’s that kept Guard upon London^bridge ^ and our Mouths Should be no otherwise employ’d than in being made Nests for Flyes to breed in 
The Dutch can bear me witness, that 
during my stay there, I was not idle in paying my Respects to the Family of the Stuart s., and in Particular to that Branch of it that suffer’d me to make my / Eshape uripunifh’d, when he had it in his 
Ppwersto intercept me. I was, still whispering in their Ears how easily Presbytery might be establish’d in England., and what a trifle of an Undertaking it would be, to make it a commonwealth, and hold it’s Dependency from the sevenprovinces;

Short, neither Prayers or Entreaties were wanting on my part, and I cry’d out Fire where there was no Smokcj in order to call the Mob together and prepare em for a Mutiny. lean tell you thus much for myself, I was reckon’d ho Starter amongst the Burgomasters; and I had many a Merchant with a Dukes Coronet on his Coach, that came to Consult with me about the proper’st Place to Land in. 
People may talk as long they please of a general Invitation from the Nobility and Gentry; but I know how Mattets would have stood to this very Day, had not I bestir’d my self to a Miracle, and engag’d for Some Friends of mine in the West, who 
had borrow’d.money at fourteen 
of me, to aslist the then Prince of orat^ge, 
And yet it Seems, I stand in need of 
being recommended to make that my. Practice, which I have constantly adher’d to from the Date of my B d fell s incon tinency. 0 Tempora, 0 Mores f May I never finger Guinea or Pistol again, if it was not beneath the Gravity of a City

The two Hundred Maidens at th

You have heard of pur Calvalcadp 
at the Reception of. the Queen, and the Gazette has inform CL you that the Spirit of Continence has been visible increas’d at the Bath within these few year. Pardon us, we Speak of the Ladies under a State of Matrimonial Bondage, for the Citizens; Wives are still the same, the Country Gentlewomen keep up tp their 
old Interviews, and the Gamefier, and Man of much address with little Fortune, is as assfiduous at the Bedchamber and Toy let, as ever has been known. 
How Shall we do to Entertain Fler Ma sty on the next Occaston, fbe Shall be pleas’d to favour this Town with, he only knows that first made Maidenheads for the Courtiers are fb pressing with us, and thci Stars and Gaters have Such an influence pver our Constitutions, that yy.e iimch fear a general Surrencjry, and \, T. ..... that 
\ 
r 

that the Enemies Artillery will force us to yield at Discretion;; formidable appearance, makes ns believe their 
Guns are well mounted, and its a terrible thing if you’ll believe the Western jlajfesy to hold out a Siege till the line my storms the Body of the place Sword inhdnd. 
All that we have to say is, that if we should turn backflidersj it’s no more than our Mother s have done before us, and tho’ we decrease in our Number for the 
< / i 
present, we Shall make it our Endeavour to add to it nine Months hence, by the Accestion of many a pretty Innocent by way of Recruit. 
But it seems the Ladies of your Town have had more Modesty, than to put upon hermajesty as we have done, and make 
mrs mouth water to write them down 
also young Maidens. A Fumbling sort of a Spark, he believ’d what was sent hint to a Tittle, though Some of us can prove to the contrary, if it be true, That a certain Shopkeepers Daughter, entrusted, her Secrets two years since;; the hands 
of her Father s journey map, and virtue ous Mrs. Betty P — m dropped fbraething which the Ignorant still think her pot less’d of in a great House .not far front Qolden^square* 
• t 
 
However we have the Reputation and Fancy goes a great, way towards at foundation for a Ladies Character; we appear’d all like Amazons, perfect man haters; but Some Gentlemen that have Read us otherwisethan in the Public News, can attest from our Private Conversation, we are not what we are taken for, and are as inclineable as Nuns at a Grate to think well of a Sex We cannot be angry with, while they do not ruri away with What they prize us for, and leave us in poftestion of the Goods that for Some years will be (carce the worse for their’s, or other Folks wearing. 
twas a merry Ibrt of a Project that it was, and a Plot well laid to let Her Majesty know, what a Heav nly sort of a Place Somerfetjhire was.' The Story of the Seven thousand Virgins Was ejefer vedly held for Fabulous, and receiv’d as a Popish Legend; but our Wifeacres that took Sr. Charles cottereu's Office upon ’em, and marfhalsd us Rank and File according to Order, pick’d out no more than Two hundred to be the more readily believ’d, and have thenifelves takien for Encouragers of the Reformation now carried on amongst us.

Our Aldermen perform’d their Parts to a Miracle, with Mr. R — r at the Hpd of ’em, fb many Foreheads So many Pair of Horns to defend ’em; but we are ready to burst at the Account, two or three young Oxford Schollars that have hedg’d themselves into the Rear of the Court, give us of your Heads of Colleges and i>octors. They tell us, Dr. M — r got rid of the Spleen for an hour or two, and was pleas’d to think while Her Majesty kept her Court at Chrifl church; there was one in the uni verstty had a higher Authority than himself 
in it. That the Head of jesus and his Brimstone Society appear’d all with quick filvergirdxqs^ and fcratch’d where it itch’d, to testiste thdr Loyalty and AS Section to tne present Governtnent, and' that the Men of qjieees ^ Midi Tim

In Short, We are told there is no^di verfion like that which your grave Dons gave the whole Courts and that old Wyat had got by Heart, the Devil and all of hard Names to have call’d hermaiesty by, had it been thought Proper to have had her addrefs’d in the Latin Tongue.

B alio I and New College did enough, for they fpoke.what those that had the Care of’em, bid cm, and he that does that of their Birth and Estates, fulfiirs his Fathers, or Guardians designs to a Syllable, stnee Metre and Bomhaji does not recommend a Gentleman to St. Stephens Chapel, and he’s much nearer being chosen a Parliament Man, that can Hire others to write for him, than he that is forc’d to be at the trouble of writing for himself.

these Parts, that the Gentlemen who

Conquests may please his Fancy, but I that have no prospect of those that are Real must ask his ejtcuse; since there is no Mustek in tcd^i&{»; r, thar thank God for Afflicting us; and I would not be thought Such a Fool of a General, as to think Heavh would accept me for my Sincerity, in declaring to the World I gave Praise to the Divine Power, for ' letting the Earl of Marlborough get the better of me. 
I Shall never forget him, while there is any Breath in this Body of mine. I was told, he was a Courtier, a very Complarstmt sort of a Soldier, andone that would Show the highest respects to the Second Prince of. the Blood, and Presumptive Heir to the Kingdoms of France and Navafr, but it was all Fiction, and not fb much as a word of Truth

'' Ah Brother, I am like to fall into a 
Fitjat the very Name of him, and your Customer Prince Eugene cannot be half fb > terrible to you. Before his Arrival, whenever I thought fit to Decamp and Change my Quarters, the Enemy quitted theirs for my Service, and I cock’d up my Hat and Feather like a Fury, wherever I took a Fancy to entrench’ my self. But would he turn Tayl to me do you think, when I delir’d his Absence, and took a Fancy to the Place of his 
Residence?? Situation pleas’d me, 
and: 

nd I tiiarchd Bag and Baggage with my Mirmidons and Domestics to take pofteflion of it. But he was for stretching his Authority as lawful Landlord, and Sent me packing with my Writ of ‘ejectment at my A — fe, as if the Devil drove me. 
whats the meaning of it I cant tell 5 but a Prince brought up in Compliments, and lent into a Country to do 
what he pleas’d in it, might have expected a Decenter Entertainment. I was fed up with Hopes that he would quit his Habitation, and leave it for me to entertain the Court Ladies in; hmteouf flers was mistaken and reckon’d without his Host; and I have had nothing but the smell of gun^owder^ and brimstone was ever since in my Nostrils, which is never like to leave me, unless the Court Puhiils get the weather Gauge of the Camp Perfumes, and overcome that which has overcome me. 
However, notwithstanding all these Punishments, and my being order’d to return to Paris under pretence of sick ness; I have receiv’d the Compliments of the Magistrates belonging to the Several Towns I pass’d through, and the marquiss of Bedmar, Such another Com 
queror

I vow to God the old Gentleman was as glad to see me, as ever he wain his Life : And took me into his clo let with as much Solemnity, as if I had all the Secrets in the World to make him acquainted with, while I was ready to put Fingers in Eye, and fall into Tears for fear of his being Angry at the News Boufkrs lent me home within he Journal.

I wear nothing but Red, and other Military Accoutrements since my Arrival, and fifty Pistoles in hand to the Abbot that writes the News paper, has extoll’d me to the Skies for my Great Skill in Affairs Military.

it’s Agreed of all Hands, Dear whig love, that we have lost; the Day 
but what of thatit’s yoi^r Bulineft yet to keep your Station, and Continue 

tinue in the Place where our Noble Friends have fix’d you. Mischief may be done still, and there are other Places to bring Matters to bear in besides St 
Stephens Chapel. Other Counties have Slighted us enough, but Mr. 
G — : — izf and Mr. B — Her have Play d the Devil with our Party in the County of Cornwall by their Church of Eng < 
Interest, as the Vnfound call it. 
One might have thought, you might have stuck in an Obstacle or two, and hinder’d the First from flinging out of the List of Parliament six of our best Friends, or given fbrae obstruqion to the Latter, in his being either made Choice of himself, or in < the Election of those he put up. 
But in all Changes of Government,; Things run on with a high Hand at jfirst, and you can as fbon Still the Winds, or bridle the Fury of the o cean, as stop the Raging of the Multitude in its full Career. We have Money enough to Maintain us, and lie quiet till Matters Cool, and come again into their Natural course, and thanks to our slippery Fingers in the late Ministry, we are not without wherewithal when this Nine Days 
Wonder 

Wonder ce^fes, and the People ar gone Home to their Homes, to call ‘em out again, and Purchase a Mutiny of any Price whatlbeven. 
Sedition, Boy, Sedition is thy known ^ Tallent, and a Whisper or two in a 
Country feilow*s Ear, with a Piece of old in his Hand, will do Miracles. Your Instructions therefore that bear this Company, and are Signed 
with the Signets pf the Committee of Riots and Tumults, are nicely to be pbferved, and put in Execution. The way for us and our Noble Friends to come again into Play, is to put on the Appearance of Sanctity, seem mo deratly inclin’d, and prctendedly Affected to Church and State, though we Hate both, and Wish nothing more than cither’s Ruin. 
You are a while to Commend the Proceedings of that Parliament, whose Elections you have hitherto oppos’d, and Insinuate yourself by Degrees into the Conversation and Affections 
• r 
of those People that have been your chiefest Enemies, du Matters Ripen, and the Season gives you an Opportunity of coming to Action. This Gen 
tlmttn U our Friend says the Mob in 

a Trice,. Cnw, Siry Here s a Health to 
the Queen and Parliament; Drink ir, though it goes down like the Poyfbn of Afps with you, and give cm to understand with what a Sincerity you Wish the Continuance of the Government, and the Three Estates now Astembled 
at vveflminfier* 
However you may give a Sigh by 
the By, and ask em whether they have heard the News, tell em you are loath to give Credit to it, but if you are 
in devonjhircy Glocejlerfhirey Somerfe> 
Shire, or any of, the Clothing Countries, that you have it from Good Hands That the Members belonging to thole Counties are great Sticklers against the Woollen Manufacture; If you keep your Residence in Cornwai, or Wales, 
That you are well aftur'd, Lead and Tin will be declar’d Contraband Goods, 
_ 4, ^ ^ 
this Session, and a Penalty put on Such ^ as presume to Work in the Mines; If m torkjbire, That Horse Racing will he out of Doors, and that there must he no Such thing in Being as a Collier or a Jocky after Such a time, because of an Act of Parliariient in Agitation, for People to Burn Wood, and Walk a Foot; and the like in other Countries, 
 
as you she their Genius and way of 1 rade. 
This will infallibly put the whole Kingdom into a Fit of Petitioning, and coniequently we may have Room to Hope for another Dissolution, since without doubt the Parliament will again Assert their own Privileges, and not permit themselves to be preshrib’d to, by a Parcel of ^nshlefs Fellows that know nothing of the Matter. 
This is the Effect of our Consultations for Ways and Means to get into the Ministry again, it’s left to you to acquaint your Deputies therewith, as Occasion Shall offer. But you expect to hear how Things are at Xo» 
and whether the Dice rim fb low on the partys Side as they have done in the Country. 
Why truly, I wish, your Country Chaps were So well Affected to the Caush, and that you had no more reasbn to Complain than we have, tho’, Sir Sam Dajhpqd is at last got into the Chair, and our General Officers that Appeared like fb. many Paul Diacksy or Prince Eugenes, must henceforth, if tfiey destgn to Appear at bum/l Fields, 
or the Artillery groundyvivn their Canes, 
or

■tis true we most sagely cry’d Popery

But at the same time were by Whigs over run. 
The Mitre was tumbling, the Nation 
undone; 
And we fufer’d thole ills, till it came to that Pals 
The Church was revil’d while distenters

While Saints in Pretence with their Faces awry, 
Gave their Hearts, and their Tongues and their Actions the Lye,

And Men of no Faith were esteem d for Beliefy 
As Cal'ztwy and Lmher^ and the rest of that Sort, 
Were receiv’d all like Angels in City and Court, 
And abundance of Postures and Whims in devotion. 
Made Religion appear nowhere elfe but in Motion. 
Our pious Lay elders kept a Rattling and Roarings 
To cry down the sin of Adult ry and 
Whoringy 
But all to no purpose for their words were but Wind and 
their Teachers themselves have been fleshly inclin’d,

And who ner sows his seed in another ‘ Mates Ground. 
So for want of Example their Zeal was in Vain, 
And we still did relapfo to our Vices again. 
Our Youth were train’d up like a parcel of Fools, 
And went out of the Road in purfoit of their rules, 
By the Means of their Guides lost in Darkness and Night,

things right. 
But thofo of more fonfo saw how matters were varied. 
How Precepts .Drew lame, and good Manners mifoarried. 
How Canaan (once blefs’dj grew a dif folute Land,

How Canaan too long under this Burden stood,

the Fortune of a Soldier, I have 
travel’d safe hitherto through all the four Elements since I last Saw you; Earth and Air have been all ways familiar to me, but So much Fire and Water as I have run through since my Departure from engund^ without receiving the least Damage, has almost persuaded me to believe I could live

ing, and like a Salamander in the Fire without fcinging my Corps, fb many whizzing mestengers of destruction have terrified my Ears in Some of our Attacks, that the greediest Usurer in Christendom, had he known the danger I stood in, would have been unwilling to have given six house pur chase for my Life in an Annuity, when the Front of the Assailants were fi) woundedly troubfd with the Falling

Thus do they behave themselves with Such undaunted Refblution, that they Show no more Concern for the lost of a Member, than if they thought it Criminal to return home without stcrificing a Leg or an Arm to the Service of their Country; and that no body would give Credit to their Courage and the difficulties they have struggl’d with, except they bring home a maim’d Carcase, as a Manifejlo of their Behaviour amidst the Dangers they have run thro’. 
I suppose by this tin^je you have beard strange stories of fbme part of 
M 4 rbg 
 
the Soldiery and the Nuns i I know not how much the snow bau may have gather’d in the rolling, but I alture you the devout sernguo had no other ufase from us than what I am const dent they were well pleas’d with, and were fb highly Satisfied with our Deportment to them, that after we had oblig’d them with all things in our power, to gratiste our Civility, they offer’d to change their Religion, and would have follow’d the Camp; and therefore, whatever was done to the dishonour oi Popery, and the Glory of the reform’d Churches, I hope can be thought no evil by a Tme blue’ pro^ defiant. Some of t>ur Brethren, I must: Confess, after the Inhabitants had de x ny’d us Necessaries for our Money, 
made bold to drink the Queen of £» gun^s Health in Some of their Wine 
fellars pretty plentifully; and when they were merry, perhaps, like true con querours, they might Seek out for a few Female Captives, to exercise their Fury upon; but what ever they administer’d to the sptmi[b Ladies I affure you was perform’d with that Modesty and ten dernefs, that I never yet heard one of them Complain of her usage. But on 
the 
 
the Contrary, the Nuns lik’d us better than their Priests, and the towns wo wen better than their Husbands. 
I have nothing farther to entertain you from St. Maries of my own; but a Brother Volunteer being troubled with a Rhiniing Scrubbade, has ventur’d to exercise his starving Facultie amongst us upon the foregoing occa ston; and to Show his Wit in an Army, has run the Hazard of being thought a Coward. Whether it will Relish with your nice Pallate when it Comes to your taste, I know not; but I affure you the Bullet headed Critticks among us, notwithstanding the Scarcity of Paper, have hitherto preferv’d it 
from being made Bumfodder. Therefore 
I hope, as it is well intended by the Author, it will be So accepted from your astured Friend and humble Servant.

of your old Companion as well as myself, have made themselves merry over the bottle with your Amphibious Epistle, which partaking of two kinds, and running into 
thole 

those different Elements, Prole sod verse, we thought, might very reasonably admit of fb uncommon an Eph then We are all very Glad to hear that the Goddess has showed 
her self fb much your Friend as to Protect you by her Shield under all those dangers it has been your Chance to struggle with : But cannot forbear thinking that when the fatal Reaper of the Bloody Field was fb bufis a amongst you in getting in his Harvest, how heartily you wish’d yourself (notwithstanding your Bravery) in a snug Room at the i^ofe with two or three merry Companions over a good Fire and the Bottle, where you would have no worse Enemy to encounter with, than a Battalion of Bumpers, and iio other danger to fear than staggering Ebriety. 
I must cdhfess I know not how great a pleasure, you wandering Heroes may propose to your selves in the Glorious fatigue of War and Battle; or what a 
Felicity you can find in the Smarting Experience of Blood, Wounds and Slaughter, rewarded perhaps at last with a Wooden Leg, arid fb hop back again and fhovy your rnaim’d Member as a

But for my part,. I must ac knowledce I am made of a tenderer "Mould, and never could reconcile myself to the Mercenary Trade of man killiog in my Life; and rather than to have fail’d So many Leagues as you have done that had no occaston to run the

liv’d under the Instuence of venusy and would have been true to the Bottle, and Loving to my Mistress, contented with my present Allowance, and have waited with patience for the ' Deatii of the old Curmudgeon, who 
must 

must leave you when he dies, what’s Sufficient to make you happy. 
All Your Friends, I affure you, are very much surpris’d at your going into the Army, and think it wonderful that you, who had as many fine Ladies under your Command, as ever had solo mon^ could on a Sudden forsake that Charming Seraglio y Oil wcrs .Viiiflcr of f ' at home, to hazard your Life abroad for the Embraces of a froufy Nun, who ' its likely, has been Friest ridea as often before you had her in Captivity, as Madam P — • was by the Officers of the horse guard, before my Lord — gave fifty Guineas for her Maidenhead. 
We none of us can Imagine what the Motives were that could induce you fb privately to enter upon a Military Life, when all the pleasures of en gunls Metropolis, waited upon your Appetite, and daily Courted your Inclinations. I heartily wioi you may Succeed well, but I can scarce forbear to think it was none of your own free Choice, but rather a Fate or compul five Necessity upon you, for I cannot believe a Man of your Discretion, if you’d had the power of free Will, yvould have scarce forfbok the Charms 

of English Beauty, for Cloistered sptt m(h Gravity, bead boiind to theii; Devotion, the pleasures of domestic penance for the fatigue of foreign War, the Safety of Terra jirma^ for the danger of the Seas; the Conversation of your trusty Friends, for the Company offa ladoiis Strangers; the delights of the Bottle, for the hopes of Noifie Honour, and hazard the welfare of your Limbs, for a budget of Spamfh snush, which .you ‘naay feast your Nostrils with at home for a Penny a day, and oblige your Friends into the bargain. 
I know you will expect I Should en 
/ you with fbme novelty or other from old engli[h Sodom, that may give your fancy titillatiohj but I protest the whole Town is at present lb deeply engag’d about the success of your Expedition at Cadiz, that Scarce anybody will afford themselves leifiire to mind' anything but the News Papers. The coming in of every fresh Mai! puts the whole Town in an uproar, and People assemble themselves in fiich Crowds at the Old Exchange, Pauls Church, Covent Garden Piazza, and Wefiminfter Abby, upon the arrival of a Packet boat, and the noise of a new 
Express, 

Fxprels, that the Multitude in the' Fables, who waited round the Mountain to behold the Monster, could not be in ' greater Expectation of a wonderful prodigy, than we are here of fbme stu pendious News or other, of fbme notable Exploit perform’d by the admirable Courage and Refblution of you strolling Heroes; there is Scarce a Crafy Alderman in the City of London but " 
has ventur’d half what he is worth 
\. 
about the taking of Cadiz,, and it is infallibly predicted by Coley, Gadhtivy, and Partridge; That there will be a greater Rot among the Merchants and Traders of the City of Londm upon the Istue of this Affair, than ever was known among the Royal Snippers upon the alteration of the, Coin; Nay the very Ladies pf the Town seem to be fb highly concernd*about ypur taking of St. Maries, and administering humane Unction to the holy Sisters of the Monastery, that they busy their israins about nothing elfe but your manly Exploits with the s^amjb Ladies, and cannot forbear asking every Man of Intelligence, when the Nun firkers come home, as if they were afraid the dextrous deportment of the devout Hin 

pocrites (who practice Fornication in Cloisters, and have the Advantage of being well instructed by their lafci vious Priests) should fb far excel the Correspondent Activity of our English Ladies, that they Should quite alienate your affections from your own Country Women, and cause you to have as great a Liking to the Spamjh cur tizans, as a covekf‘garde» Beau has to "Spdmjh Snuff; and that you like Cuckolding the Holy Fathers fb well ' abroad, that when you corn home no 
obliging Punk' will bear the Price of half a Crown, except she has been first Constcrated by a Priest : As of late no Harlot could pretend to come into a Gentiemanis Company, except she had been debauched by a Nobleman, and would leap over a naked sword, and swear she had rub’d her Modicum with Quality. 
I have little other news to tell you' 
'that the whole Nation is fb una 
V » % « 
nimoufly satisfym with the Conduct of the present Government, that the very Citizens of London as a Testimonial of their Loyalty,, have, thro’refpect to Female Sovereignity, refign’d to their 
much Wiser wiyesj, the fble Domination 

tion of their Families, and have for Several Months last past, granted them the outside of the Bed, as a Token of their fuprernacy. Pater Noster Row which was formerly one of the most trading Streets in the City, is now inhabited by none else but Pesty coat 
Shopkeepers; and they begin very much to enlarge their Territories on the right in Cheap Aide; fb that it is Verily believ’d by most of the Moor 
Astrologers, the City in a little Time (if the Stars can foretell anything) will fall under an amazonian govern nient, and that the Husband must stay at home and Cook the Pot, whilst the Wife takes a Walk to Cuckolds Pomty to get an Appetite to her Dinner. The Meeting Houses, which used to be crowded as full of Hatchet Faces, as the eighteen penny Gallery full of Vi,, > at squintibeuds Play, begins now to look as thin every Sunday as 2l Saturdays Change; for most of the Dist lenting Bucks, who us’d to brandish their Horns beneath the Umbrage of Toleration, beholding a storm xof per fecution at a little distance, have wisely taken Sanctuary in the Church betimes, lest when it falls, i Should break through 
that
I 
that Paper shelter by which they were before protected. The Members of the Church must Consequently be very much enumerated; but whether to her 
Glory of Disgrace, I will not presume to determine; but certain it [is) that abundance of Knaves who wer never wishers of her Welfare, are of late crept politicly into her Communion, 
for fear of being render*d incapable of Employments under the Government, by an Act against Occajioml coftformp ty, which is now on Foot; (b that an unlucky Brood of a wrong Feather, hover now under the wings of the Church, purely for an opportunity of picking up thole Crumbs, which ought in Justice only to be distributed among those harmless Chickens, which stie truly knows to be of her own Hatching. Its enough that the charitable Pelican feeds her own voung ones out of her own Bowels; but if Ihe Communicats through her tender Companion the lame Reliefe to her Enemies, Ihe can expect nothing but to be fuck’d to death, or that her self and, her own Native progeny must be much weaken’d, by luceouring a foster’d Brood with what Should add 

to her own strength and prosperity. 
But these are matters, I am a little fenstble, tooferious fora Man of your Airy disposition: Therefore I shall not trouble your more fpritely Genius with things of this Nature, more becoming the Consideration of a Plodding Cit or coffeehouse Politician • but relapse again into that Levity, which I lee now is much more welcome to a Man of your Kidney. I must needs tell you, Friend, there are three sorts of People, that very much want the Return both of the Army and the Fleet ( viz,,) Whores, Viduailers, and Vintners, who Complain So heavily for Want, that if you tarry much Longer in spaifty youir Absence will work a grear er Reformation in engund^ without the help of Informers, than ever has been yet done by my Lord S — and all his mercenary Society; for Drinking and Whoring, ever since your departure has been growing out of Fashion, for want of Rakes to keep the old Staple Sins of pur Native Country in Countenance. And I affure you as an old Bottle Companion, that the La.... of Admittance are not yet able to creep out of their old Indian Satins, 
for 

for want of your accuftomary eenevo lence; but look as Trapfing as a Par. fbn*s Wifes Chamber maid, drefs*d up in her miftreltes old Cast Offs, to grace a Solemn Anniversary, who notwithstanding the flumpness of her Buttocks, yet looks So Taper about the Heels from the Sleefinefs of her Gown 
* ft 
and Petticoat, that a body would think her whole Garment might be drawn thro*a Wedding ring without the least damage to her Condescending Ap 
parrcl. 
The Vintners alfb are in a want of you, for towards Charing Cross and vicadtuy^ they have had litcle elfe to do in your Absence, but to transfer the Scores you left upon their Bar boards into their Books, and make ready their Bills, wherein they are very Subject to Prolixity, and put themselves in all Imaginable Order to Salute you, and give you a hearty Welcome Sir, upon your Return to : Whenever 
they hear you have been upon any desperate Enterprise, the terrible News makes them melancholy for a fortnight, fearing Some unlucky Bullet or 
"‘ other Should have given them a Receipt 
in full of Some long Catalogue 
of 

of Articles which they keep, in hopes of being cancell’d after a Better manner. Tailors and Shoemakers drink every day to your Success, and Seem to have as Great a dependance upon your Safe arrival, as the Good People of England, the Rabble, have upon your taking the Plate Elect therefore whatever you do, come not home empty handed; for if you Should, you will find an Army of Moabites stand ready to engage you with little Pocket instruments, that at fbmetimes will make the ' stoutest Hero Tremble, and are offuch an invincible Faculty, that if, even they lay hold of you, they certainly take you Prifbners, and with one little Tap of the Back, will stop a Man s Journey, though he be never fb hasty. Sheriffs. Officers and marfhasmen say, they never knew Such a Vacation in their lives, and Swear they believe all the People that owe any money are Run out of the Kingdom. 
I happened the other night to be steering my Course from the Tavern home about Twelve a Clock, and at the Corner of Brooh Street ^ Stood a. 
Female Conveniency, leaning hgainst a Post, drefs’d up in White, as if ffie had 
been 

been going to beg a sweet heart from the gauoms S it being a dark Night, her Lewd Garment appear’d fb wonderfully bright, that I could not well tel] whether She was a Living Mortal, or Some'intangible Hobgoblin; To satisfy my Curioufity, I ftep’d Closer, and soon found by my feeling he was Flesh and Blood, and fit for any Humane Excereife a Man could put her to. Prithee, sweat heart, laid I, what s the meaning thou art standing in' this Melancholy Posture, at this time of Night? Sir, says she, I am waiting for my Husband. What profession or Trade is your Good man. I farther ask’d her, that he tan have business abroad at this time of Night, and put his poc>r Wife to the trouble of waiting for hint in the Cold, at fb unfeafbnable an Hour. Sir, reply’d She, if you must know his Profession, he belongs to the Law. What! says, I Sure he is not an Attorney? No Sir A Solicitor then I suppose. Noi Gad take me, said I, now I be., lieve I Shall hit it; i’ll warrant he has the Honour to be a Bayliff.^* No I was yet out of my guess;; then said I, he must be a Counsellor which is almost the Top of the Law; or a Bai 
fist 
> 
liffs Follower, which attends the very Rump of it. No Sir, laid She, he is not a Bailiffs Follower yet; but I hope in a little time he will be, for he has been an alsftant to one this four Years; and though I lay it, he is look’d upon to be as honest a Man as any of the whole Fraternity. And pray, Forlboth, laid I, what business may he be upon at this time of Night. I fuppole breaking open a Houle or stripping of drunken Gentlemen of their Hats and Wigs, as they are reeling home to their Lodgings, and lb you stand ready here to Carry off the Booty that he may go upon a fresh Enterprise. In Answer to which ibe rcply’d very Scornfully; I would how you to know, Sir, although we are poor we are honest, and to tell you the truth on’t, there being but little Business stirring this War time, my Husband, like a lawful Man picks up a penny now and then by assisting of the Night Men; and having forgot to put his Brandy Bottle in his pocket, I stay here to give it him as he goes by with the Cart, or the stench of the Vault, poor Man, will be enough to stifle him. But in Grace of God, as loon as the Fleet comes home 
from 

from Spain, he does not question getting a more cleanly Livelyhood by following his old Profestion. Madam, Good Night to you, laid I; I with you a good Stomach to your Odoriferous Bedfellow; and thus I parted with her, but could not forbear Smiling to think what wonderful hopes they had from the Return of the Fleet, as if most of the Debtors in the Nation were gone in quest of the Spamfh Fiota^ and refolv’d not to return till they had got enough stiver to stop the Mouths of their Creditors. 0) 
I am apt to think, now 1 have fiif stciently tir’d your patience and cannot but fancy, I have behav’d my self very much like a Talkative > Gostjp^ who when fly comes first into her Neighbours House, talks of nothing but her Going, and Seems very unwilling to 
be perswaded to tarry, till at last, by one Story bringing in Another, She falls into a Tittle Tattle, and quite forgetting what She before Said, lengthens her Hasty Minutes into tedious Hours, not knowing when tp rise from her Seat, or draw her impertinent Talk to a Concluston.

AS fortune old have it, I have 
now Such a Banquet of News to entertain yois with, that there is northeast 
ter t hiltiffs iffef Novctty in the 
ti whoti 
 
whole Town, bm: what will be glad to pick up Such straps of it as your distretion Slmll thiok fit to shatter a inongil: the Listening Crowd, but before you sit down to the Feast, I fancy it wonk be unnecessary to give your Stomach a whet, lest you should fall to but wdtli an indifferent Appetite; Therefore I think it proper to tell you II st, it is Great News, Good News, ' Glorious News,, and the Best on’t is, it is true too, and that I reckon is as great a Rarity to find in engund^ as Fat Beefs in Scotland or a Rich yeo rnan io Wales, Should I fall too hastily upon the Matter, I know not, but like a Woman over a dead Husband, your excels of Joy, may fling you into Tears, and Cause you to weep Nature into a disorder; therefore I would adyist you to prepare, and arm your self with as much Restlu 
'non, as if you were Just leaping into 
Bed to a Beautiful Woman, Whom you would have half bang’d your stlf to have enjoy’d before your admittance; nay to have had but Finger Coned: with her harmonious : For 
I must needs tell you, it is Such sur prifing, Amazing, wonderful stupendi 
ous 

ous News, that rather than it fhoiilcl be as false as now it is infallible, we would have fed Spamfh Mackeril with our Carcasses, and never have liv’d to have come home without doing this mighty Exploit, So worthy of being canvas*d, cuff’d about, and applauded in every Sober coffeehouse Through her Majesties dominions. By this time I liippofe you are troubled with a more uneaiy Itch than a Scotch Pedlar, and are as Sharp let after the happy Tidings I have to impart to you as ever was buxom Widow for. the vigorous Embraces of a Second Husband, therefore I will keep you, no longer in fuspence, but like a Cunning Harlot, let you slip into the Secret, now I have rais’d your Appetite. 
'You must know after we had done i&un'frking at St. Maries, where every Beau had replenish’d his Sniifn Box with Right Spanifffj whilst those that had more Cunning took care to line their Pockets with a more valuable Commodity, and whilst the Common Crowd of Heroic Clodskuls were drinking Healths to their engufjj Whores in Spaniflj Sherry, their Wiser Leaders were tapping full Chests Meo 
s xtco 

xico and Peru., in order to improve their Fortunes out of the Spoils of the Enemy; Thus when Some had made themselves drunk, others made them islves rich, and every Soldier that was Landed had met with either Plunder for the Belly or elfe for the Pocket; we were Commanded by our supe riour Officers to reimbark, and finding it but an impradicable. Adventure to attack Cadiz, by Sea, and having little p.^ospect of flicceeding by Land, we a bandon d all thoughts of endeavouring to do by force, what we had hopes of effecting by fair Means, till we found ourselves very much deceiv’d in our groundless Expectancy, So weigh’d Anchor, hoisted up Sail, and made the best of our Way as we thought horn wards, biic meeting with Intellii gence tlrat Monsteur Chateaurenaud., 
with a Squadron of French Men of War, and the. Spamjh Plot a, were arriv’d at Vigo; upon the Reception of 
the Joyful News, a Councel of Flag Officers were call’d on board the Admiral, who very Speedily determin’d the utter destruction of the Plate Fleet with all their Cowardly French Convoys and adherents, when this Gallani: 
Refo. 
#
Rcfblution was dispers’d thro’ our Fleet with all the orders that were necessary to he obferv’d, in fb Noble an peditionj Such a General Huzza was bellow’d thro’ the Navy, both by the Seamen and the Soldiers to expreis their Gladness, that at Hockley io the Hole, when a young Puppy Fivos the Old Game Ball, even then a parrallel Shout was never heard at the bear garden', thofemen that had it, Run now to their Brandy Bottles, and Swore by a dozen hearty go downs every One would have his Weight in Silver, or he would fall a Sacrifice to the Crabs that Crawl at the bottom of the o cean; fb universal a Joy was legible in every man’s Countenance, as if Frovi» dence before the Action bad given them Assurance of Siiccefs, and that every Seaman was well satisfied he Should live to see old Wapnwg once more, and there to Spend amongst Sat Punch gutted'bawds, homely Whores and blind Alehouses, the pleasing Fruirsof his hazardouslabour, a Tar Seeking after nothing further on Shore to comp!eat his happiness, than a Buxom Strum per,

Thus we cheerfully fail’d forward under a Brisk Gale, till we came within gonshot of the Town of V'igqy who by reafcn of the haziness of the wea t^ier, were unable' to dishoyer us till ws were just upon em, and then their ' Guns Spit Fire, and kept Such a Roaring at us, that the very Noifewas enough to have made a Coward leap over board and hice his head under water, rather than endure to have his Ears terrify’d with iucli darigcreus Claps of dreadful Thunder; Yet we' past'd by the Angry Town with as little regard as if our Rtogiify Carcafies had been Proof against Spamjh Artillery; or as if they only fir’d their Cannon out of a Compleraenr, and never designed to hurt u3 • Sailing forward till we came within four Miles of rodendeuo, where the whole Fleet drop’d Anchor, to give the General oiti®ers time to Consult what were the best raeasures of proceeding, now we were fb near the Booty we had Such wonderful hope? of getting into our poffestion, whilst the Seamen had recourse to their Spi; lit of Hogwasti, and Qualified both 
Soul 

Soul and Body with an enlivening Dram for any notable Enterprise, though never fb desperate thro’the Wistiom of our Chief Commanders, it was advis ediy thought fit to detach fifteen of our English Ships, and Ten of the Dutch out of the line of Battle, with all those terrible Emblems of the Ge,, 
Conflagration the fireoiips, and to send them in upon the Enemies Plate Fleet, and the French Men of War, There to use their Endeavours, like true English Desperadoes,, • take or destroy all they could overpower, and leave the rest to the Management of those who fhonld corhe after, which were our Great Ships, if there stiould be any Occasion;; all the Flag Officers to give greater Life and Spit it ro the Action, went on board of the detached Ships, and nothing was heard among the Seamen and Soldiers, but Hey boys for a Capful of Cobs or a Wooden Leg, Now Jack sparjard^ have a care of yourmustachoes,! can but laugh says another, to think how Sober John in his Gioke will run away from his Gravity, when he Sees a fireship on board of him, Tom, Tom, fiys another, how do you intend to disposh of 
O 4 your 

yolir arse, if your Head Should be shot off! Blood, reply’s the other, you raay give it a Spamfi Captain to make a Snustj Box on. I have a strong san cy, says a Jolly Seaman, though we are come out but poor Sailors, we shall return home as Rich as Princes; May hap it may be So, says his Mess Mate; but if it Should, prithee, what shall we do with our Money when we come into enguna ^ Do with it, replys the former, why, we will buy Brandy ENOUGH to make the whole Thames into Punch, and for fear we should want Tobacco, we’ll engross the whole Cargo of the Virginia Fleet, and when we have funk’d out our Weed and drank off our Liquor, then we’h come again to Vigo, and knock the Spaniards pn the head for more money. With Such sort of Dialogues, the Seamen made themselves merry. Showing no more Signs of Fear or aprehen fion of danger than if every Man had Shook off the flesh, together with the impresiions of Nature, and was already enter’d into his Immortality, which nothing could divest him of. 
The Great and Generous Duke of Ormendy according to the Refblution 
of 

of the General Officers in a Couofel held on board the Admiral overnight, Landed the next Morning with -2000 Such invincible true etngujh Hanibals, that had an Army of Goliahs stood in their way, they v/oold have pick’d their Teeth with their bayonetsymd have made the Gygantick Loobies stretch’d their Legs and straddpd over Mountains to have efcap’d their Fury. They were all obferv’d to leap upon the Shore with Such undaunted Willing? nefs, as if every Soldier would rather Choose to have his Bones bury’d in an Enemies Country, than to have return’d into his own without performing Some Remarkable piece of Service to her Majesties Honour, Eng Unds Good, and his own Credit. Their Landing by the Extraordinary Management of his Grace the Duke of Ormond was Effected with that admirable Expedition, that had So many Algter Slaves been brought into their own native Country, to which they had been Strangers feaven Years, they could not have quitted their 'Ships more Speedily, or have pursued the Shore more eagerly than the whole force that was Landed did the Gloria

ous Enterprise they were appointed to engage in : For as (bon as they had got footing upon Terra Firma, The Lord Shamon, by the Command of his Grace the Duke, led the Grana diers to the Sort that guarded the Entrance of the Harbour, who at one Resolute push, made themselves Masters of the Enemies Batteries; Upon the lost of which, the Faint hearted spamar^s in great Confusion, retir’d, for their better Security, into an old Castle, flying from the Fury of our Granadiers, like fb many Cowardly Sheep terrify’d with the Siglii of feme approaching Woolf, whole Ravenous Looks threaten’d nothing <

Whilst the Detachment of our Fleet were thus desperately Em ploy’d in Taking and Destroying the Enemies Ships and Galleons in their Harbour, our Forces by Land, through the Wisdom and Conduct of his Grace the Puke of, Ormond had made So Sue *

In a few Hours Time we had finish’d 
\ 
our Success both by Sea and Land, with the Loss of but very few Men, and without the Miscarriage of one Ship in the whole Action, Taking and Destroying I $ Sail of French Men of War, with 22 Sail of other vestels, 17 of which were Spanifl?

Our Land Forces with their Plunder, are just now reembarking, and in a few Hours time we ball tet Sail for our Native Country engund, where we hope after so Glorious an Enterprise, to meet with a Joyful Reception, and that our distenting Country Men will now Scorn to Relapse into their old Ingratitude, and Ascribe the Honour of this Great Design, and Successful Undertaking to the Living Conduct of their Dead Hero, but give alone the Glory of this Fortunate Project, under Heaven, to the Queen, who is by God admitted to the Throne, as a Peculiar

I thought myself well Posted for the Advantage of the Common Caufcj and in every one’s Opinion, Capable of doing more Service to the Party where I am, than if I handled my pen never So dextrousty with you in England.

We had a Report, a day or two Since, that Her Majesty was with Child again, and its beyond Defeription to tell you what an Alteration it made in feme Peoples Countenances here at Court; Such a Courtier drop’d all his Hopes at the very mention of it, and bad Adieu to the Thoughts of an English Peerage for ever; This Favourite look’d as if he bad been Thunder 
I 
struck, and Domitte miserere mjlri vj2^s 
as visible in his Face as ever it appear’d in mine at the Censure of the Five 
Gentlemen, and their Commitment to the Gate Ploufe* That German Count, who must be a Noble Man, forscoth, without a Foot of Land, and who had before the News came, nothing in his Head but Meddows of Great Britain and Ireland and large Tracts of flourislring Acres in the most Fruitful Counties belonging to ’em, fancy’d to himself that he star’d Famine in the Face, and must have Hunger and Thirst for his Familiar Acquaint tance.

Brethren, Her majesty’s most tlnduti full Subjects, to leave the Place of our present Abode. 
Said I to my feist 'John thou art one of the unluckiest Dogs now Breathing, and whatever Side thou adher’st to, is always that of the Unfortunate. I could almost perswade my Seif to turn Church of England Man this very Moment, in hopes that it will Ruin that Interest, notvhonefl titmoatsf 
of Everlasting Memory, has Shown me thi way, and if he has brought an e ternal disgrace upon that Religion by wearing the Habit that belong’d to it, 
without all manner of question I must, 
come 
 
come up to bis Character in Scandal, by making Profession of it’s Principles which are the very eftentials of it. 
When in comes a Courier with the welcome Notice that it was a false a larm, and that there was nothing at all in the Report. That the Queen indeed was well in Health, but the Prince her cohsbrt was as good as given over by his Physicians, which would in all Probability give a mighty Shock to Her Majesty's Constitution, whole Life, by her Conjugal Affection to him, was almost bound up in His. Nay then, thought I, Matters still go well enough of our Side, and the Nobility may continue to run in Debt for their Equipage, Their younger Brothers without any Danger of losing the Intents of it, rnay learn ^ngltjh again, and their Tutors Trust origin hopes of Payment in their own Country Coin, when the Joyful Day Shall come in which one of the Electoral Family Should fill th Throne of Great Britam* 
But notwithstanding this, I had my Fears still, and it was not beyond a possibility but his Royal Highnels might Recover again; While there is Life there is lipfes^ fiiys the Eftglijb,

and I was fb Zealous for the Cause that I have So deeplyembark’d in, 
I could have even wilh’d that his Pulse 
/ 
had no more Motion than theii; s that keep their Royal Residences amongst the Tornbs at 
My Fears were but too just, for the next News we had from your Parcs, brought us his unexpected Recovery, and dasts’d our former Joys with a mixture of Bitter sadner We are told here that his Royal Highness is, much better than for many years past, that his Looks are more lively and vigorous than ever, that his Appetite is come to him again, and that both Houses of Parliament have Congratulated her Majesty on this great occast on. That her Majesty continued to look like her self, full of Majesty and sweetness, that file had wholly parted with Sorrows for her Dear Princes Sickness, and in all Appearance, the Kingdoms govern’d by her, would have a lasting Enjoyment of Blestings under her Auspicious Reign, and the Protection of his Royal Highness; that ' her Majesty would for many years be of an Age yet to bear Children, and the Prince in a Condition of Health to 
Bless thp Nation with em 

Confider Man of Imprefftonj what tn Influence fiich Afflicting Ideas had upon my Spirits; I arh but Skin and Bones at the besti but I grew a mere Skeleton at the very Rehearsal of these 
Melancholy Tidings: I no more thought of Preferment now chan of being Clerk of the Closet,, qi^en Am, or Lord High Admiralin the Rpom of Prince George; and all the glorious Conceptions I had entertain’d of the Downfall of Episcopacy,, making patiis Church a Livery Stable for Horses, vanish’d in an instant. 
However it is our bufiness to make the Best of a bad Market, and yours that are within the Reach of the Laws of engunk, to congratulate her Majesty after the Example of her Parliament on this Lanientable Occaston. Tis but playing the old Game again, and Addressing Her ( as our Party did her Father) on an Occaston which they were heartily fbrry for. Jack Tut chin has Shown you the Way, and I cannot instance in a more Hopeful Precedent for your Imitation. 
Now L am Speaking of our old Acquaintance Jacky stippofe you put [the Union between Scotjan^ and England 
in 

in his Head, and advis’d him to Bellow forth in fbme of his next ■ observators against the Re establifhing of Bishops in that Ancient Kingdom. What if those Gentlemen in White and Black had a Right to ofbciate there as Such; from its very Original, and the Kirk was never heard of there almost, before the Reign of James the Sixth; He has Impudence enough to prove the Legality of their Expulsion down to adam and the Antiquity of our dearly Beloved Faction, to be as far off as the Chinese hold the Doctrines of Confutim', and would be very Serviceable to the Party, could he be persuaded to leave off the Pursuit of his Friends at the Victualling Office, and finding Fault with the Commissioners of the Navy, and the irregular Practises in the High Court of Admiralty, and give Heart to the Party by fetcing the Scotch and Engltfh together by the Ears, and advising the First not to give way to the least Demands of the latter. 
This would do fbmething' indeed and increase the high Esteem, most Perfbns in this Country show for that 
author’s Writings. I begin almost to 
be 

be Jealous of him, and Afraid that upon another Revolution he should have a better Post than iny self, he stands up fb gloriously in Defence of our Dissenting Brethren. Some People a amongst us here, are Transtating those Admirable Pieces into the Language. A Lutheran of Quality a mong us here, has feiit for me to b teach him Englijhi on purpose to Read 
em, and every Man that has the least Infight into the Public Occurrences, dwells upon the Name of the Sieur 'Tutchm* 
As for my Part, you need not doubt my Astiduity, to bring Matters again to their former Crisis. Bernard Lintot Shall not want Copies while he continues his Value for me, by not letting me want Money. ' In the mean time, fet all Hands at work amonst you to carry on the Good Old Cause, and Show that you deserve Preferment in a Change of Government, from the Diligence you make use of to bring i^a bout.

’tf^ls a Sign of good Breeding to be 
Communicative, and I would as Soon cease to be number’d among the Living, as among thole that are either Talking or Writing. There is Something beyond a common Pleasure in those excellent Offices, and Handing down Occurrences from one Peribn to another, is the most Agreeable thing in the World. 
My Friends in the late Reign being most of ’em out of Place in this, I have left off standing Sentinel at the Parliament house Door, and holding People by the Ears ( that led me by the nofevin the Ln, with Stories of making good Deficiencies of Funds, 

cffor a Place of as much Profic every, whit to me, which is that of a re tainer to a Coffeehouse, an Indefatigable Tale Bsarer, and Porter in Ordinary to all the News Writers in Town. 
Nothing goes amiss to me, and as I rim at all, So I burden my Memory. wlih everything I hear, whether Matters of fbme Moment or none. Having told you my Trade, ir is but na tural for you to expect a Cast of my Office. To the Bufinest in Hand then, there's not a Dust of Tobacco in Town, but what bears the Name of Right 
Snuff; and one single Galleon is Reported to have brought home more Pigs of Silver, than the whok Spamjh Plate Fleet had in it. I was afraid at first, there would have been no occasion for Ways and Means to Raise more Money, and that Men of my Business would be wholly fet Aside, but it teems things go quite otherwite, and the Four 
Shillings in the P -- TIS likely to 
Pais, notwithstanding my Fears to the Contrary. ' 
Even those that were Some Hundred Leagues distant have got Plunder by means of that Glorious Action, and the 
vqyy Swcetners, Guinea droppers, and 
2 Sharpers 
k 

Sharpers have made their Advantages by it. Fortfmouth zna Gosport have experienc’d if, and the Men of Dealy who are almost Capable of putting Tricks upon the Devil, have been Outwitted by it. Under the Disguise of being Sailors, they have.dut off false Money, Watches, Rings, and what not, and there was no need of Trying whether Gold or Silver bore the Touch, did those that offer’d 'etnto Sale, af firm they came from Vigo, 
But thebufinefs at that Place has been fb rauchtaik’d of, and our News Papers so mightily taken up with it, that it will not be improper to Divert you with other Subjects. 
For the State of Learning then, which must be a Novelty with you in the Country, since even the very Man that Writes the History of the Works of the Learned knows nothing of the Matter. Books are grown a mighty Drug, at the very time the fress is So much employ’d with ’em, and you no Sooner hear of the Death % ■ fan Eminent Divine, Lawyer ou Physician, but an Action comes after it, or an Advertisement in Print of the Fair Way with the Price in the first

, Yet your Authors keep on working for the Grocers and Tobacconists, and White K — tithe Anti convocatiocist, though he is at the same time a Member of the lower house, surnishes ’em ai most every Week with Innumerable Rheams of Wall Paper; were you to see him stride the Street, you would take him (boner for a Fellow come from the Plough Tail, than an Arch deacon, or to read him in hismagisterial Style, imagine be was rather a Bishop than one of the Inferior Clergy, from his Arrogant Didacticks. Dr. Atterbury has no more occasion to stand in fear of him, for as much as I see, than of his Antagonist the Dean, with his Huge Unintelligible Folio, and the Judgement of the whole University in his Favour, will have a greater Influence with Men of Sen, than that of a (ingle A— — and a few of his diocesans in theirs, especially stnce the House of Commons have made a Resolution to stand by those whose Prerogatives that Author has So justly Asserted.

As the Men of God are falling together by the Ears, So are the Men of Belial likewise, and the Divisions crept in a mong those that bear the Name of DP vttte, have alio their Influence on, them that bear die Name of Profhaney I mean the phjficum^ that for want of Diseases to Combat withl fall foul on one ano there. A certain Gentleman, I dont care if I give you his Name, one Dr. Pint, having lately fallen out with his Benefactors, and Shown a Piece of Gratitude,. to the Apothecaries, that is common to People that are Raised without Desert, by Exposing their Medicines, and making the World believe they were Guilty of Extortions, in a Book of his, that only for the Malice it abounds with, has born a Second Impression. Dr. jo feph Browff has taken up the Cudgels a gainst him, and made fiich a Reply to him, as will be Valued by the Judicious, while either good Sense, good Manners, or a good tile will have a Repute in the World. 
I cou’d wish the Doctors Fortune was equal to his Deserts, or that the Company, whom he has taken Pen in Hand to Vindicate, wouid give him due ibcouragement, that they may not 
lessen 

lessen their Antagonists Ingratitude by their own, for its my Opinion, the Bookseller whom it’s Printed for, may Spare his Eighteen Pence for a Quart of Wine for the Author of the History of the Works of the Learned, though I understand that Gentleman takes it, as his due for a Line or two in Praish of any Book, and lam credibly inform’d he commended the History of England in two Volumes without Reading it, for the abovefaid Constderation. 
This Pen and Ink Duel, in all probability, will bring both Armies to a General Battle, and tho’ Dr. G — — • in his Difpenlary, has already given the Day to the Collegiate Mortars, it is not two to one but the Society in bucv Friars will sting a Bomb put of theirs, as far as those in Warwick lane^ stnce they are fb well provided with Ammunition and Artillery. 
New Plays fall from the Stage as thick as Hail, and half the Nation is running Mad after Poetry, A Snuff Box and a icrap of French and Latin lets you up fora Judge, and accompu ihes you for a confirm’d Critic. t’other Day, I went to see one that went by the Name of She wouldy and She

give you a farther Specimen of the 
Taste that Audiences now in Fashion, have for Oramacick Performances, who but T — D — — stbould come upon the Stage Pother day, with his weuern Lass, and a Hundred Cork Nick Knacks and Whims to keep it from Sinking. The Play Bill for the Poet s Day, was as full of Merry Conceits, as a Quack doctor’s with the Names of dtfeafesf and answer’d Expectation to a Miracle, for he had a House as full as it could hold, and notwithstanding 

ing the most Abominable Prologue that could be thought of to Welcome Home our Heroes from eunders and which those chat came from thence ought to have broken his Head for, he won the Day, and triumph’d over his Audiences Judgments and Pockets at the lame time. 
Whether it was out of Compassion, or Infirmity, no one knows the Audiences design, but I have oftert seen the puin Dealer zndth.q Committee Pieces of Inlpiration if compar’d 'with his hungry Jejune Lines, without a Third

When I was in London last, I left thee a down right Projector, a Thinking, Talking, Plodding Dog as any in England; but now it fecms thou hast alter’d thy way of Living, made an Escape from the Confines of Cogitation and fell into the
