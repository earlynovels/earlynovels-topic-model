IN that delightful feason of the year, when nature throws forth all her hoard of charms, and puts to shame the weak efforts of art; when the groves were adorned with verdure, the meads and gardens enamelled with fiowersi when the little Warbling choriffers of the woods begin to make their nests in the thickset branches of the shady bowers. In the reign of our late Sovereign George the istj there came to letdc vol. I. B at

at a Small village near Plymouth, a French gentleman and his lady, whose names were Le Montague, they left France, their native country, upon account of their religion. Monsieur Le Montague had been master of a vessel, with which, making many prosperous voyages, he had gained a pretty fortune; and was now resolved to pafs the remainder of his days in .a country of liberty, where he might enjoy his religion without molestation, having dispofed of ail his cffeds in France, and remitted the money by bills to England, into the hands of one of his correspondents at Plymouth, where he chose to settle; he having '.Some acquaintance with the most: considerable merchants, with whom he had traded.

She was at the expiration of her time happily delivered of a child, which proved a girl, whose life in the Subject of this history being full of Such strange misfortunes and wonderful adventures, that it well deserves the notice of the public : ’they gave ' ■ her the name of her fond mother, which was Harriot; the child was So beautiful, everybody that saw her admired her.

Poor Harriot was left to the care of her father, who was deeply

wise, looking upon the child as the dear pledge of which was left him, of their mutual affection: he was so doatingly fond of her, that he was resolved never to marry again, but to make it the bufiness of his life to instruct and provide for her on the mosh advantageous manner he was
able.
Nor was his good intentions frustrated, for Harriot as she increased in years showed so great a capacity, and So quick an apprehension in all she went about, that he had reason to expect great things from her; nor were

bis expectations without Soundation t for before she was twelve years old she could play on the lute and harpsichord dance finely. Speak French and Italian perfectly, Sung delightfully, writ delicately, and used her needle with So hiuch art and skill, as if Pallas had been her governess. Monsieur Le Montague offered praises to heaven hourly for her, and was more fond of her than he ought to have been, fancying he could not outlive the loss of her: she in return for his excessive fondness, was So obedient to his will, that his commands were always punctually obeyed; fly never offended him. But man is a frail creature, and there are unlucky hours in life, which, if not carefully armed against, give us opportunities of being undone. A merchant of London, in whose hands Monsieur Le Montague had a great Sum of money, died, and he was obliged to make a journey to town on purpose to look after it, and get it out of the executrix’s hands

keeper, to manage the Servants and wait on his daughter : he Set out for London as Soon as he had provided everything necesfary for the journey, and took up his residence at a friend’s house in the city, where he was joyfully received. When he had trans adted the business he came upon, he was resolved to stay a few days to enjoy the pleasures of the town, where. he had not been for many years : he went to court and the playhouses. His friend and he being together one evening at the play, two very hand some vvell dreifed ladies came into the pit and sat down before themi, one of these ladies was very beautiful
and genteel, the other Seemed to be
her

her companion. Monsieur Le Montague felt a strange .alteration in himself, at the sight of this woman 3 he fell into difcourse with her, aud presented Some oranges and Sweetmeats to her j h found her conversation as bewitching as her fiice and mein : his friend kindly cautioned him, but in vain. In fine, the phy being done, he prevailed on the ladies to be admitted to See them home, and aficed his friend to accompany him, which he, after great persuasions, unwillingly consented to: they ushered the ladies into a coach, the ladies bid the coachman drive to a street in Piccadilly, where being come they alighted, and the gentlemen were invited into a house furnished very genteely. They staid Supper, which was Served up by two maid Servants, consisting of cold meat, tarts, and wine.
Supper being over, they entered into a free rnanner of conversation j the lady, who appeared to be the

mistress' of the house, was tlio' youngest and handsomest, told thenv (he was a widow, and had buried her husband about two years before, who was'a country gentleman j he had. kft her a moderate fortune, and died without issue. She finding the country too melancholy for her, had come to London with this lady her aunt, who was a widow alfb; but having had an ill husband, was not so well provided for, as one of her birth and iortune deserved: they had taken a house in that part of the town, as most airy and retired, and had but few visitors: then She excused herselfwitk a charming air of modesty, for having admitted, these strangers to this freedom, which indeed Monsteur Le Alontague had desired with great importunity. They Spent the remainder of the evening in a very agreeable conversation, and then refpedffully took leave, after having obtained of the two. ladies permission to. repeati

their visits, and continue the acquaintance chance had fb happily begun. The Servant having called a coach, Monsieur Le Montague gave her half a crown, and entered into it with his friend, over head and ears in love with his charming widow; his friend pleasantly ridiculed him all the way home, telling him these ladies were doubtless kept women or jilts, but Monsieur Le Montague was So inflamed with love for the young widow, that he was deaf to all he Said, yet Seemed to hearken to him, and turn the adventures into a jest, Saying,, he did nof intend to visit them any more.
When he got home he was very desirous of going to bed, but the thoughts of his charming widowto deprived him of rest, that he lay awake all night, thinking on nothing but her. He visited her the next day, and was entertained with So much modesty and wit, that he lost all consideration, and resolved, if possible, to gain her for his wife. And now it is fit that we
B '5 Should

Should know who She was, and that we relate this fair one’s life, whose true name is Melinda.
She was the younger daughter of a country gentleman, of a good family and estate, and though well educated, and very witty, and accomplished:, yet being wantonly inclined she at the age of fifteen fell in love with a young officer of the guards, who carne to the town her father lived in to visit Some relations. This gay young rake, who had a wife and two children in London, made love' Secretly to this young lovely une perienced girl, and having prevailed on her maid to let him meet her in a grove behind her father’s house, where he pretended honourable love to her, and promised to marry her. In fine, having gained her affedfions and ruined her, fearing her father would revenge the injury he had done his daughter, if he came to the knowledge, of it, he one evening took leave of her to go for London, pretending it

But alas! the deluded malin da, young asxfhewas, too well discerned her lover’s base design, and was distradsed with Sliame, love, and revenge; She reproached him (letting fall a Shower of tears) in words so tender and so moving, that had he not been a hardened wretch, and one of those heroic rakes that have been well versed in every vice, that this famous city can instrudl youth in, ffie would have relented; but he was a complete gentleman, and had the tongue of a lawyer; was as deceitful as a courtier, had no more religion than honesty, was handsome, lewd, and in -- constant; yet he pretended to be much concerned at leaving her, and made a thousand protestations of his fidelity to her. He fet out for London the next morning before day, and ^
left the poor undone Melinda; in the

utmost despair; she was afraid to drc' close her grief to any but her treacherous maid, who had been the confident of their amour i Some months past without one line from him, whicte convinced her of being more unfortunate than She at first imagined; she found herself with child, which put a thoufand dreadful designs into her head, Sometimes she was resolved to put an end to her wretched life, and prevent her shame, but then refiedf ing on the miserable state her soul must be in for ever,, those thoughts made her desist from her dismal purpose;; finding it imposhble to conceal her misfortune much longer, she was resolved to go to London infearch of the wretch the author of her miseries.
In order to’ this she got what mo iiey she could together, and one evening, having before acquainted her treacherous confident with her de stgn, she packed up her deaths tyidi what riilgs and other things she, had;

At midnight the maid got two of the menservants habits, which they put on, and So disguised themselves, each carrying a bundle, they went away from her father’s honfe by break of day; the maid having ordered her brother, to whom she had told her design, to meet them a little way from the house with horses, on which they mounted; he being the guide, went with them twenty miles, which was near halfway to London. There they parted with him, well rewarded him for his trouble, and he took thchorfes back, after bribing him well to be secret j but they did not fear. he would make any discovery; he being so much concerned in assisting,

She wanted not wit, her youth and fine habit She had on, informed him She was a person of no mean degree. He asked her many questions, and made her large offers of his Service, and She was nobly treated by the old gentleman at dinner.
. They being now within a few miles of London, the unfortunate Melinda, who knew not where to look for a lodging, nor how to find out the base author of her miseries, ventured to tell the old gentleman that Ihe was a stranger in town, and Should be highly obliged to him if he could help her to a lodging in Some private house of good reputation, and a sight of Frederick, whom she fupposed he might
have

have Some knowledge of, being an officer.' The old gentleman was indeed no stranger to him nor his vices, and immediately guested the condition of the unhappy Melinda by her blushes : he joyfully told her, that he was well acquainted with him, and belonged to the same regiment, and that he would introduce her into the house of a lady who was his relation, who would study to make her as happy as she could destre. The unfortunate Melinda joyfully accepted his generous offer, looked on this as Providence, and him as her only friend. But alas, stis was greatly deceived, for it was Only a forerunner of greater misfortunes which proved her entire ruin; for the captain believing her now entirely ruined, had his own satisfaction in view, and pitying her condition, knowing the villainous Frederick was already married, thought it would be a deed of charity in him to keep her for himself, In order to which, as Soon as the stage came to
the

the inn, he hired a hackney eoach, into which he put his nephew and a Servant that be had with him, who rid up one 0 his horses; Sent them home to hi own house; and went with the lady and her maid to a house in Piccadillyy where dwelled a useful lady, in plain English, a private quality bawd, who' used to lodge a mistress for him often. This private procuress was well-bred, and a Saint in appearance, she lived in Ib private a manner, that her neighbours was unacquainted with her pro feshon. She passed for a married lady, and gave out that her husband waa first lieutenant of a man of war, and that he was at the East Indies, where the ship was stationed, and that she let her lodgings to people of fashion; she kept a maidservant, and always had a handsome attendant or two which pasted for relations, who came to visit her out of the country. She was called aunt by one, and cousin by another, as she directed the poor creatures to
style her. The house was neatly furnished.

nished, and there was no young creature in it at that time but our unsor tunate traveller, and a lady whosc name was Lucinda, a young girl a bout eighteen years of age,, who had been trapanned there, and ruined by a nobleman at that time famous for such villainous actions; this was the person that was with her at the play, when Monsieur Le Montague law themv The captain presented the unfortunate Melinda to this good lady, giving her particular charge to be careful
and kind to her; but the old infinuat
^ /
ing bawd had no occasion to be told of that, for feeing her So young, hand some, and So well dressed, was well pleased with her company, and was determined to pradlise all her arts to gain her esteem and friendship, hoping in time she would prove a good bargain to her. Supper was soon provided, and our unfortunate traveller eat very heartily. Being a little fatigued with her journey. She drank two or three glasses of wine, which made her

for the present forget all her misfortunes. He pressed her to know her eircumstanees, she freely told him.
- that the base Frederick had promised her marriage and ruined her, but she would not tell him her true name, nor from whence she came, but with tears entreated him to bring the base Frederick to her, which he promised. to dp the next morning., He then took his leave of her, much charmed with his valuable prize, hoping he should soon obtain his desires, but in his heart he could but condemn his friend’s villainy, as he knew that he was already married.
He went to his own home to his wil^j, for he had one, a very amiable good Sort of a woman; he had likewise two children, but had never shown a parental regard for neither, nor a sincere love for his wife, but used her very ill. The poor unfortunate Melinda was condudfed withsher maid to a handshme chamber, the maid undressed herself and was soon asseep,
but

but the miserable Melinda could not close her eyes, She refledled on her own actions. It is impofiible to describe the uneasiness, or more properly Speaking, the agonies Ihe underwent, when she considered that She had left her tender parents, blasted the reputable family She belonged to, since none could but help guesting the cause of her Sudden flight; that she was now a stranger in the place, in the hands of tshose she knew nothing of; that in cafe Frederick, from whom she had little cause to expect any good, refused to marry and take care of her, she was ruined to all intents and purposes; vv^as Scarce Sixteen years of age, in a strange place, and lay open to all the frauds that are practised in London, and amongst strangers that she was not the least acquainted with. She could not return to her friends, nor had with her but a small matter which could not long keep her from starving; and how was she to provide for the poor helpless infant she was then big
with?

with? This thought almost broke her heart; she shed a flood of tears and thought death a great happiness if she could be blessed with it; thus she pasted the night without clofe ingsher eyes; thus by one imprudent action we then ruin the peace and quiet of our lives for ever, by one false and imprudent step undo ourselves. Would mankind but reflect how barbarous a deed it is, how much below a man, nay, how like the devil it is to debauch a young experienced virgin, and expose to ruin aird an endless train of miseries the person whom hia persuasions hath drawn to gratify his beastly lust, to oblige him at the expense of her own peace and honour to gratify his desire. It certain that if our laws be just that punish a man with death who kills another, lie certainly merits that or Something wors^ that ruins an innocent helpless virgin, unacquainted with the frauds of mankind. What an abominable detested villain is he who betrays a

fholish maid, that credits his false oaths, vows, and cursed deceitful tongue, and at last abandons her to Shame and misery? Is he not worse than a Savage, nay, the Savage has more humanity. And if women were not infatuated, doubtless every maid would look on the man that proposes Such a question to her as her mortal enemy, and from that morhent de fpise him. Forgive this digrestion, our unfortunate girls condition and wrongs must inspire every generous mind with some concern and resentment against the greatest part of mankind.
The captain, who dreamed of hall night, and was on fire to possess her. Sent for his friend Frederick in the morning to a tavern, told him of his adventure, and asked him what he meant to do with her, and who she was : but to this last question he was dumb, well knowing that the wretched Melinda was the captain’s own niece, being his fister’s daughter. He laid Ihe was a country fquire’s daughter
.2  01^
ter in another town, that he could do nothing for her, but give her a purse of money, and remove her to a cheap lodging, and Send her back to her father’s when she was up again. The captain reproved him, and Said he would himself pay her lodging, and contribute Something towards providing for her: nay, in Short, that if he would quit her company he would keep her. But Frederick was startled at this proposal, fearing he would difeover who She was, and that it would be a quarrel betwixt them, and his ruin. He desired Some time to confider of that, and concluded to go immediately with himto her. They found her up, her eyes Swollen with weeping: at the moment Frederick entered the chamber, She Swooned j his love revived, he catched her in his arms; the captain, disordered with this sight, went downstairs, and left them alone with none but the maid, who Shutting the door, left them together, ’tis needless to relate what

f>a fiionate expressions pasted on her Side, and excuses on his. In fine, he told her She was in an ill house, that the captain had bad designs upon her, and that he would that evening fetch her away and take care of her; that She Should not discover who She was, as She valued her own peace and his life. In fine, poor Melinda, born to be deceived, gave credit to all he Said, and followed his diredfions. The captain and he went away together; and in the evening Frederick, having gone to an obscure midwife’s near chelsea, and took a lodging for her, fetched her away and carried her thither, pretending great fondness. Here She continued Some time, never stirring
out of doors. Hceontinually visited her, and told the captain Ihe had Sent her into the country. At last she was delivered of a dead child, and lay long ill of a fever,; and Frederick, being quite tired with the expense, proposed to her to return home. She urged
his promises and vows to marry her,
till
2
till he was obliged to disclofc the fatal Secret to her, that he was married already. What words can express her resentments and disorder at that instant.? In short, he left her in this distraction, and that evening Sent her a letter to call on him in a coach alone at a tavern he appointed, saying he had thought of a means to make her easy. She imprudently went, there he had hired two bailiffs to arrest her with a false action. She was by them carried to a sponging house, and there kept while he sold his post, and with his family went into the country j having the night he trepanned her took away from the midwife’s her deaths, money, and jewels, and discharged the maid; who not daring to return to her friends or mistress’s father’s, went down to an aunt she had in another shire; when Frederick had dispatched his bufiness and was gone, the officers told her he had released her, and she might go where she pleased, She was So weak she could Scarce

walk, nor knew one step of the way, or the name of the place stiewas in.' 'One of these fellows was So moved with her complaints, that he led her to the midwife’s house as She di '^rected, having learned the name of the street during her abode with her. The midwife, who knew nothing of what she had Suffered, received her with amazement, and Soon gave her an account how Frederick had taken away all her clothes, and Sent away her maid, which So affiidted Melinda, that she went half dead to bed. In the 'morning, not knowing what otha 'course to take, having neither clothes nor money, and the midwife being poor, giving her to understand (he could not long entertain her, she re solved to Seek out the generous cap tain. In order to which she desired the midwife to go with her in a coach to the lady’s house at Westminster, to which he had at first carried her: they went, found the house, and were received by Mrs. -- -- -- - with rhuch

civility and kindness, The colonel was sent for, and came before dinner; he took her in his anm.with transport, protested never to part, but take care of her tist death. Sh related to him Frederick's base usdge of her. Tie told her he had sold is pst? and
left the town. And in Short, the mid wife, bdng treated and rt Awarded for bringing her thither, took leave. The best rooins in the house were ordered for Melinda, and the captain did that night steep in her arms : thus her first misfortune involved her in a worse. Some months She lived in this manner, being richly clothed and bravely maintained by her gallant, who doted upon her. In this time She contracted a great friendship with a young woman in the house, Lucinda, who was very handsome, good-natured, and about the age of twenty : they were continually together, and lay in one bed when the captain did not come to lie there. By this means they became So intimate, that Lucinda gave
her
\
 7
her an account who She was, and how She came There.
She told her She vas the daughter of an eminent divine, who had le ven children, and very good preferment in the country; but living very high, and breeding his children up at a great rate, provided no fortunes for them; So that dying before they were placed out in the world, thy were left to Shift; and fiie being one of the
^ o ^
youngest, being then about thirteen, ' was taken by a lady to wait on a little daughter stie had about Seven years old, and with the family brought up to town; that in a year’s time her master, who was a young 'gentleman, ruined her; and fearing her lady Should discover the intrigue, persuaded her to quit her Service, pretending stcknefs, and that London did not, agree with her; and take leave of her lady to return to her mother, who kept a boarding school in the country to maintain herself and the children, two of the boys being yet at
'■C 2 School,
2  OP
School, and two girls at home. But she went not to her mother as She pretended, but into a lodging her master had provided for her. In this house, he for two years maintained and kept her company; but at last growing weary, gave her a small allowance; So that by the bawd’s persuafions, She admitted others to her embraces, and was at this time maintained by a merchant in the city,. and concluded her story with many tears; Saying, She did not like this course of life, and wish’d she could find a way to leave it; but that the bawd always kept her bare of money by borrowing and wheedling it out of her, and that they were always poor and wanting money, living, as she Saw, very high in diet; that she had had Several children, but had but one alive, and that was at niiiste at cheisea, being a little girl, about three years old, which she had by a young lord, who took care of it. Melinda promised to Serve her in all She vas able.
Now

Miss Harriot Montague.. 29.
Now a strange turn happened in her affairs : the captain’s brother-in-law, melinda’s father, having made all the inquiry after his daughter that was postible in the country, and offered a reward to any that should inform him what was become of her, was at last acquainted with the manner of her going to London by the maid’s brother who had procured the horses for thein. On which news he came away for London in search of her; he arrived at his brother’s, the captain’s house, tells him his bufiness, and begs his assistance to find her ouc knowing nothing who had debauched her at first, nor why she fled tho’ he too rightly guested that must be the occasion of her withdrawing herlelst The captain, who had never seen his niece Melinda in the country, having not been at his brother’s house for many years pash was a little surprised at the circumstances of time and place where he met with this young woman, and longed to get to her to ques

ti n her about it. It was night when, : hi s brother arriv’d. So he was oblig’d to delay Sativsfying his curiosity till the. morriing; then he went, to Melinda, and teliins her tbetreason of his coni ing, and that her father was, come; She Swooned, and by that too well convinc’d him, that he had lain with his own niece, and not only commitr ted a great sin,, but dishonoured his family. He at this moment felt the slings of guilt and bitter repentance; he resolv’d never more to commit the like; and now from an amorous lover, who ufed.to teach her vice, he became a wise monitor, and preach’d up virtue and repentance.; and told her, he would that day remove, her from that ill house and place her in the country, give her a maintenance to live honestly, and if poslible., dispose of her to advantage; that he would.endeavour to reconcile her to her father, provide CD she would never difclose what had pass’d between them,. She gladly a? greed to all: and here providence was
so.».

So merciful as to give her an opportunity to be happy again; but, alas, youth once vitiated is rarely reform’d; and woman, who whilst virtuous is an angel, ruin’d and abandon’d by the man Ihe loves, becomes a devil. The bawd had prevented all these good designs from coming to effect, by introducing a young nobleman into her cornpany, the most gay agreeable man in the world, who was very liberal to the procurefs, and made Melinda suck large presents, and used Such isheto rick, that she could not resist his Solicitations, but yeilded to his desires. She was for this. cause deaf to reason, and acquainted Lucinda and Mrs. — what had passed between her uncle and her: So it was agreed that She Should go where her uncle desired;; what Ihe could, and return to them. In the evening.the captain came and took her and her clothes away, and carried her to chelsea to a widow gentlewoman’s house that was histriend, The next morning he rec

turned with her father, having tolci Ifim, that Frederick had ruined her;; and that having fled to London, She had found a lady of his acquaintance out, where fly had been taken care of for four days past, having been abandoned and ill uled by Frederick that he had heard of it from this lady but the day before his arrival, and counselled him to forgive her, and take her home again, or continue her with this good lady to live privately,, and allow her something. This was what the captain had contrived, and taught Melinda to say. The father heard this with great grief, andfwore to take revenge upon Frederick j but that heaven pievented, for they had news of his death Soon after; being tiii own from ofl' his horse as he was hunting, and killed on the spot, in, which hraven’s justice was greatly manifested.
Now doatingupon the unfortunate Melinda, he cordented to see and provide
 -3;
vide for her, but not to carry her home to his wife and other daughters,, lest it Should publish his misfortune more; but resolved to allow her a convenient maintenance to live with this gentlewoman, and at his return to say, that She was run away with, and married to a person much below what he expected, belonging to the Sea; andsthat he had done what he thought fit for her, and left her in town., This, he thp^ught, would silence his neighbours and affii dead wife, who had been long indisposed with the grief stie had fallen into: on her account.
’tis needless to relate what passed between the father and daughter at their first meeting; i the. dishrder both were in was extraordinatybut having promised. to allow her thirtyr pounds a year, on condition She lived, feberly and retired in this gentlewoman’s liouse, and. dispatched Some other affairs that he had to do iotown,, he: returned home; - and She remained

Someday, s in this place, her uncle vir siting, and frequently admonishing her to live well and repent of her fol iies. But she could not. bear this confinement,, but longed to see her young lover and, friend Lucinda again.: in short, she watched her opportunity one morning, when the gentlewoman went out to a friend that lay sick, who had Sent for her; and packed up her clothes,, called a boat, and left a letter on the table for her uncle, to tell him she was gone' to town to live, at the house where, he had placed her in before,.. where she should be glad to see him; and so went away to Mrs— —
Siie was joyfully received. The
captain Soon received the news of her iiightv and the letter;, went to her,
and. used all arguments to persuade
her thence, but to no pnrpofe; so she continued there, ' and had. variety of lovers; learning all the base arts of that vile profession; till at lash having, been so cunning as to have laid up a thousand pounds, besides a great

growing every day more lovely in? her eyes, and her husband Seeming more reserved to her, and to take little notice of the child. So enraged her, that She resoived to get Harriot out of her way if possible, that Diana might inherit all the fortune. Captain Du Pre went a voyage or two to France and Holland; and returning, when he came back to visit her. She made known her wicked design to him, and in fine, gained him to afiish her in it. They contrived to send her beyond Sea by Some captain of his acquaintance, and he pitched upon a French Adaster of a Ship, who was. used to trade to Virginia and the le w^rd islands.

It was agreed on betwixt them. So Soon as he was ready to Sail to give them notice; and now the fiital day was come when the innocent lovely virgin, who was in the thirteenth year of her age, was to be deprived of her dear father and friends, and exposed to all the dangers of the Seas, and betrayed into the hands of cruel relent less men. Monsieur Le Montague, the evening that the ship was to sail,, which was about two days after they had agreed with the captain in this barbarous and unnatural project, went to take a walk with a neighbouring
* gentleman. Captain Du Pre came with
the
42 The HIS TORY of
the French captain to invite Mrs. Le Montague and Harriot on boardflie in obedience to her mother in law’s desires, went with her in the captain’‘s boat, little thinking that she Should make So long a continuance; and being come on board they were highly treated, and Something being put into Some wine that was given to Harriot, She was So bereft of her Senses, that they put her on the captain’s bed, and left her senseless, whilst they took leave of him and went on shore in a chance boat, which they called pasting by the Ship, which weighed anchor and Set Sail immediately. And now Mrs. Le Montague,, as they had contrived. So Soon as they were on shore, began to wring her hands and cry like one distraiied, pretending Harriot was drowned : she alarmed all the people as she went along, saying, that she fell over the fide of the boat into the Sea, and no help being near, was drowned: none could contradict her, because no body could
tell
 3
tell what boat they came in from the Ship; the boat being gone off before She made the out cry. Being come aside, she threw herself upon her bed; and her husband being informed of this news by the laments of the Servants at his entering into his house, and going up to her, asking a him,, questions of the manner of it; She so rarely acted her part, that he believed she was really grievedj and Harriot certainly drowned; which so Struck him to the heart, that he was Seized with a deep melancholy, and Spent most part of his days in his closet shut up. from company; and the mornings and evenings walking alone in Some retired place, or by the Seashore. Melinda, being highly pleased that she had acted her part So well in having got rid of the obstacle that gave her so much disgust, and that her husband took the loss of his Harriot so much at heart, flattered herselfthat she should Soon be a widow, and re t’^rn to her dear London, and enjoy

the company of her dear Du Pre without molestation.
It is necessary that we leave them for the present to inquire after the innocent Harriot, who waking about, midnight, was quite amazed to find Lerfelf on a bed no bigger than a couch. Shut up in a nasty filthy closet,. and hearing the Seamens voices, Soon discovered the fatal Secret, and knew that She was in the Ship. She got up, knocked loudly at the cabin door„ upon which a young gentleman opened it, a youth of excellent Shape and features, in a fine habit; he had a candle in his hand, and Seemed to‘ view her with admiration. ‘ Lovely ‘ maid, (Said he) ^ what would you
^ please to have, for I am bound to obey
‘ you, and would willingly lose mylife in defence of yours ?’ ‘ I beg to know ‘ Sir, (Said stie) ^ where my mother and; ‘ captain Du Pre are, and why I am ^ left here alone ?’ He remained si lent a moment, and bowing, answered, ‘madam, lam Sorry that I must

her. But what words Can express her confusion and gries when she found in what manner she was betrayed by her cruel mother in law; she fetched a great sigh and fainted : at which the young gentleman ran and fetched some cordial water from his chest, and gave her; when reviving, she fell into a transport of Sorrow, calling to heaven to help and deliver her. She desired to see the captain, and made use of all the entreaties she was mistress of, to return with her; telling him her father would give him treble the sum if he would restore her to him; but the hardened wretch said that he had receiv’d his orders, and was determined they stiould be punctually complied with; the poor undone Harriot, finding nothing would avail, gave way to her Sorrow, and refused everything they gave her. Leander, for that was the youth’s name, waited till her paslion was a little mitigated, and then began to reason with and comfort her; telling her, she must Submit to the almighty’s will, and

that file Should look upon his being in that ship as an earnest of god’s favour to take care of her: that he was in circumstances that rendered him capable of Serving her; that his name was Leander, and that his father and hers had been intimate friends, being a merchant who lived at barba does, but had been dead about a twelvemonth, having left him and one daughter in guardians hands, he not being yet of age: that these guar dians used him and his sister ill, having put her into a monastery against her will, she being engaged to a young gentleman whom they would not let, her marry, pretending that he was not a Suitable match in fortune, and that she was too young, being but fourteen, to difpofeof herself; which they did with no other design, as he supposed, but to keep her fortune in their hands as long as they could, in hopes that both he and she might ' die single, and leave all in their power, being his uncle’s by his fathers fide,

and heirs to the fortune which was very confiderstble, in cafe they died without issue. That his father hav ing effefls to a great value in Virginia in the hands of a gentleman who was brother by his mother’s fide, She was likewise dead, he was going to ask this uncle to take possession, and to ask his assistance to deal with his guardians, whom he had left, because he had Some reason to fear that they designed to poison him; having been informed, by a trusty Servant who had lived with his father, long, and now left in his house at Barbados, that he had over heard them contriving his ■death; that he had taken with him a good Sum of money, and Some merchandise to trade with in Virginia. And thus Leander having acquainted Harriot with his circumstances, concluded with many promises to take ■care of her in the voyage, get her out of the captain’s hands, and would make her his lawful wife when he came to Virginia. She heard him

■attentively, and answered with great modesty, that if he did protedfc her from being injured by others, and adfed in delivering her as he pretended, both She and her father, if they lived to meet again, would endeavour to be grateful to him: that She had now restgn’d herself to God, and was resolved to submit to what he pleased to permit her to suffer, and to prefer death to dishonour. He embraced her on his knees, and vowed to preserve her virtue, and never Suffer her to be wronged or taken from him whilst he had a drop of blood left in his veins, but to merit her favour by all that man could do, which he as nobly .performed as freely promised. And now poor Harriot had none but him to comfort her; and tho’ she strove all she was able, yet grief so weakened her, that in a few days she was confined to her bed. Tis neediest to relate all that the tender lover did to render himself dear to the mistrest of his heart; he tended and watched “with

her many nights. Sat on sher bedside, and told the tedious hours, alarmed with every change of her distemper, which was an intermitting fever: he fee’d the furgeoti largely to Save her, and at last had the satisfaction to see her recovering; youth and medicines both uniting, restored the charming maid ‘to health, and Leander to his repose of mind; who now Seeing the ship not many leagues from the ddir cd port, flattered himself that she should be his. But, alas, fate had otherwise determined; their faith and virtue was to meet with greater trials yet, and the time was far off before they should be happy.
Harriot being now a little used to her new way of life, began to recover; little her drooping Spirits, by being continually entertained with the company of Leander, for whom by this iime she had no Small esteem; they were continually together except when decency required them to be asunder. One evening as they were

both walking the quarterdeck with the captain, treating with him about her ranshm, the weather being excessive clear, not a cloud to be Seen, a man at the masthead cried out a sail, which was bearing down to them with full Speed, and in half an hour’s time they could perceive that She was a ship of force, which they feared, as it certainly was, a pirate. She came up with them in fortyfive degrees of latitude, bearing English colours, she mounted thirty guns, well manned; and they Soon discovered who they were by their firing at them and putting up a bloody stag, bidding them Surrender, diredfly lay to, and poured in a broadside. The French captain Du Pre, did on this occasion all that a brave man could, nor did Leander fail to show his courage, but sought both for his mist refs and liberty till he was wounded in many places, and retiring into the cabin to have his wounds dressed, there he found the affrighted Ilarriot lying in a Swoon on

floor : at this sight he forgot himself, and catching her up in his arms, fell back with her, and having lost much blood, he fainted; mean time the villain Du Pre was killed on the deck, and the pirates gave a great shout as Soon as they Saw him fall threw out their graplings, and entering the ship, Soon mastered the few that were left to oppose them, and coming into the cabin. Saw the fair Harriot and her lover holding her clapsed in his arms, as if rcsolved in ' death not to part with her. The pirates, who had taken the ship, being English, French, and Irishmen, belonging to the crew at madagascar, were moved at this sight; particularly a desperate young man that commanded the pirate ship; he was charmed with the face of the reviving Harriot, who lifting lip her bright eyes ravished his Ssul; he raised her up in his arms, forcing leander’s hands to let her go, he being still fenseless; she looked upon him with much amazement, but was Silent with fear. The
pirate

pirate captain comforted her 'with tender words, then She Sell at his feet, and entreated him to pity her companion, Leander. He presently ordered Some wine to be given him, had him laid on the bed, and his wounds dressed; then left her with, him, whilst he gave orders how to dispose of the goods and men that were left alive in the Ship, commanding the richest merchandise, Some provisions, and the guns and powder in it, to be carried aboard' his own ship, and. the men and merchant ship to be dismiffed with what he thought fuffi eient to Support them till they reached Barbados or Virginia, excepting no person but the fair virgin and her lover. Whilst he Saw these things done, and Searched the ship, Harriot had time to bewail her state and her lovers, who was now so overwhelm’d with grief and pain, that he coulcs Scarce utter his thoughts in these moving expressions: ‘ My dear har riot, stis our hard fate to be now

My dear Leander, I will die before I will yield up my virtue. Leander, pressing her hand, replied, Alas,
‘ there needed only that dreadful ‘ thought to end me f and So fainted: her shrieks brought the pirate captain, who was an Irish gentleman, (wh story we shall'relate hereafter) down to the cabin door, who Seeing he wringing her hands over the pale young inan who lay senseless, began to suspect he was her lover, and wa fired with jealousy: however, he r.

Appeased with hearing he was her brother,, the doubtful of the truth, he embraced her, and promised to do what she desired; commanding his surgeon and crew to do all that was necessary to Save the young man’s life and recover him. Cordials being given him, and his wounds carefully dressed, he got strength daily. Mean time the captain, who was deeply smitten with the lovely Harriot, entertained great fnfpicions ofleander,. had them carefully watched to discover whether he was her brother or not, reshlving to get rid of him if his rival: but Harriot being on her guard, so well behaved hersels, that

If she would eonfent to marry him when they V come ashore at the issand of Providence, which was at that time the pirate’s place of rendezvous, he would make her the richest lady in Christendom, and give her brother a fortune, having Such immense treasures bury ed there in the earth, of jewels and gold, as would purchase them a retreat, and all things else they could desire in this world. To all these offers she gave little answer, but modestly excused herself from making any promises, saying she was too young to marry yet, and would con fider farther of it when they came ashore, yet thanked him for his generous treatment of them, These delays still more inflamed him; he grew every day more earnest and im importunate, and often proceeded to kifs her in leander’s presence, whole

inward grief can hardly be described, which his face often betrayed by turning pale, whilst his enraged Soul Sparkled in his fiery eyes when he Saw his mistrfs rudely folded in the arms of a villain, who was not worthy to wipe her shoes. One day Harriot, willing to change the diff course of love, begged the pirate captain to inform her who he was, and how he came to follow this unhappy course of life; i perhaps, slid she, being convinced you^are well descended as your gentlemen like treatment of us inclines me to believe, I shall esteem you more. Glad to oblige her, he began the story of his life in this manner.
I was born in Ireland, divine Harriot, of a noble and loyal family, who fighting for King James II were undone; my father fell with honour in the field, our estate was afterwards confiscated, and my poor mother, a lord’s daughter, left with three helpless children, of whom, I was the
eldest.

eldest, exposed to want. I was then eighteen,, and had ai Soul that could not bear misfortunes, or endure to See my mother’s conditionso I took my young lister,, who was then but ten years old, and fair as an angel, and leaving my mother, and my brother, but an infant,, at a relation’s house, who charitably took them in, escaped from my ruined country and' friends to France, hoping to get Some honourable post there, under that hospita ble generous king who had received my prince. When we arrived at St. Germains, having Spent what little our kind friends had given us at our first Setting out from home, we were received but cohty. My lister, indeed, was by a French lady taken to be a companion for her eldest daughter, Something So like a Servant, that my Soul burned with indignation. I waited long to get preferment, living on charity, that is, eating at other tables. At last I fell in company with Some desperate young, gentled

men, who, like me, were tired with this uncertain course of life, some of whom had been bred to Sea; we agreed to go Separately to Breast, and iieze in the night Some Small vefisel ready vidualled and equipped for a voyage, some of us having first gone aboard as pastengers. This defign we executed, with so good Success, that finding a Small merchant ship bound for Martinieo, we Sent five of our companions, being in all fourteen, as passengers,, on board with our trunks of clothes; and pretending to take leave of them, all followed, staying till night, drinking healths with the French captain,, who fuf pected nothing, and had but eight hands aboard of twenty six that belonged to the ship, which was designed to weigh anchor, and Set sail, the next day: we Seized upon him first, and then on his men, Singing ■ so loud that they were not hearei to dispute by the ships, who were lying near us in the harbour; wc bound

and put them all under hatches, and Set sail immediately, resolving to make for the istand of Jamaica, where we hoped to sell the merchandise we had in the ship, which was laden with, rich goods; and having n>ade our fortunes there, to go for Holland, and settle ourselves as merchants, or look out for Some other way to make ourselves easy, and gain Some Settlement in the world. When we were got to Sea, we fetched the captain up, and told him partly our design: : begged, to be Set ashore with his men, at Some port of France; pleading he had a wife and Seven clildren, and was undone if we carried him thence im that manner. So we contented to his defire, and at break of day gave him one of the boats, and six of the mento carry him to land, which I fup pose he got Safely to, having heard nothing more of him.
And now we put out all the sail we could, and had a prosperous voyage,. lill we came near Jamaica; there.

And now. Sweet Harriot, I have told you my unhappy story, his in, your power to reclaim and make me happy: promise then to be mine, and I will marry you, and take all the treasure I am master of, and with your brother sail for Virginia; from thence well go to England as passengers. You (hall acquaint your uncle that we have been taken by pirate?, and left on that place; for my ship shall in the night make off, and the boat having landed us, shall return to it; So that we and our wealth shall be left without fear of discovery.

Finding that his importunities verein vain,, he grew enraged, and told her, he was too well acquainted with the reason of her coldness towards him; and Since fair means would not do, he would try other methods. At these words Leander started up and Seized him by. the throat, cried villain it is out of thy power, for thou cannot nor shall not whilst I live; but though lean der was a great deal stronger than the pirate, it was a very imprudent thing, for he was Soon overpowered, after having lain three dead at his feet they Seized him, put him in irons, and carried him down into the hold. Harriot transported with grief at this dismal sight, threw herself at the pirate’s feet, and told him, ‘ ’tis in

At these words She rose and left him, and sat down with st look So resolute and calm, that his soul shook: he sat down by her, and reasoned with her: ‘ Lovely Harriot, said he, wshy ‘ do you force meto be cruel?

Mean time the pirate captain, recovering from his fwcon, got up, so wounded and faint with lost of blood, that he could Scarce crawl to the door, from which he pushed Harriot, whom he did not at that instant know; he called for help, but Seeing the enemy driving his men back upon him.

He gazed upon her with admiration: her beauty and youth were Such advocates, as a gallant Spaniard could not refuse anything she asked: he took her up in his arms, promised her all she desired, and commanded the young gentleman should be immediately looked for, and, if living, fet at liberty.

The Spaniards Soon found and freed him, bringing him up to the cabin, where Harriot
received him with transport; and the Spanish captain, and his friends, gave him joy of his freedom. The pirate captain, at her entreaty, was taken care of by the Surgeon, his wound dressed, and put to bed, being al mosl; senfeless, and in great danger of death. And now a Sufficient number of men, with a lieutenant, being left on board the pirate Ship, Leander and Harriot, having all that belonged to them restored by the brave Spaniard, went on board his strip, where they were highly treated, and might in Safety bless God, and enjoy Some repose.

he began to hate him as his rival, and meditate how to take her from him. It is the nature of the Spaniards, we all know, to be close and very subtle in their designs, very amorous, and very revengeful: this Cavalier wisely concealed his passion from her, and contrived to get his ends so well, that he effected it without appearing criminal. In their passage to St; Domingo, they met a Small French merchant ship bound to Virginia, whose captain was acquainted with the affair: they saluted, and the French captain came on board; where, feeing Leander, he appeared very joyful. ‘ Sir, said he, I have a lady ‘ on board, who has left France to ‘ follow you, the charming mada moifelle .Damiila, your guardian’s ‘ daughter, who, sensible of the inju

Thus resolved he Seemed pacified, and in a few days they got into the desired port, and were received by his uncle with much joy.; who promised, upom hearing his nephew’s story, to assist him in all he was able, to oblige his guardians in France to do him and his sister justice.

In this time he contracted, a great friendship with a young gentleman, his uncle’s only fon, a young man of extraordinary parts and goodness, handsome and ingenious; his name was Lewis Dumarefq, which was the name of leander’s mother’s family: he was about twenty-two years old, and had travelled most parts of Europe.

The weather had till now been very favourable, but as they were sailing near the Summer istands, a dreadful storm or hurricane arose, and drove them with Such fury for a day and a night, that the ship at last struck against one of the Smallest of them, and stuck So fast on the shore that they could not get her off, which obliged them to get the boats out and lighten the ship of the guns and. heaviest things, in doing which they discovered that the ship had Sprung a,

All the hope they now had left, was, that Some boats or baishs would come to their relief from the adjacent islands. The storm being over towards evening, after baviiig taken Some refreshment of vv^hat provisions and drink they had left, which they had brought on shore, they ventured to vv^alk about the istand, on which was plenty of fowl and trees. Don Carlos leading Harriot, they wandered to a place where they Saw' Some trees growing very close together, in the midst of which they perceived a Sort of hut or cottage made of a few boards and branches of trees, and coming up to it Saw a door standing open made of a hurdle of canes; and concluding this place was inhabited by forneshody, curiosity induced them to look into it.

The conversation now turning to be general, - every per Son Spoke their Sentiments of Le montague’s adventures; Some days pasted with much anxiety, provisions were husbanded, and their fears of wanting daily increased;; Le Montague Soon ■ mended, and company rendered their Solitary way of living in this desolate place more Supportable; they were hourly in expectation of feeing Some ship pass by to the adjacent istands, having placed a white cloth on the top of a stick on the most eminent part of the istand, to give notice of their distress : thus they Spent three whole weeks, in which time most of the victuals they had Saved were, Spent, the dreadful apprehensions of famine appeared in every face, and every one walked about looking

what they could find to eat, in hcpes to Satisfy nature without diminishing the Small stock of provisions they had left. Don Carlos, who was one of the most vigilant in Searching out Something to give Harriot fit for her to eat, went one morning to the farthest part of the istand, which was about Seven miles over, and there as cending a high rock, stood looking on the Sea, and perceived a boat fastened in, a little cliff of the rock, out of which cliff a black came, and launching out the boat, put off to sea, making towards another istand. Don Carlos concluded this person lived Somewhere in this rock, and resolved to Search about it in hopes to discover Some persons there, by whom he might be astisted and his friends, to get from this dismal istand, or at least to wait the man’s return, or find out his abode, in order to return thither that evening. He found it very dangerous to descend on that fide of the rock next the sea, and was long eter

he could find the place out of which he Saw the man come forth; but at last he perceived a Sort of a door, which seemed to shut in a place that was the entrance of a cavern in the rock : but it was fast locked, and he could not discern through the keyhole anything but a glimmering light, yet he heard a human voice like a woman’s, talking to a child, but he understood but little of it, because it was a language he could not Speak much of, being English; he waited some hours, and finding the man did not return, he went away, and hastened to Harriot with the glad tidings that he had found.a boat, and persons on the issand. Both she and the whole company were agreeably Surprised with this news; and the captain, Monsieur Le montague;, Don Carlos, and Harriot, all resolved to make their evening’s walk to this place.
In the morning Harriot and the rest walked to the rock in the evening, and getting up to the top of it. Saw from

Don Carlos called to them in French, at which the man looked up; and Harriot Spoke in English to the woman, desiring her to come up and Spbak to her; on which the blackamoor pushed the woman in, and returning no answer, shut the door upon himself and her. Don Carlos and the rest concluded that they feared being discovered; So they all descended the rock and went, to the door, resolving to Source it open if they could not gain entrance otherwise, and remove tneir fears by Speaking gently to them, and acquainting them with their distress. They knocked and called at the door for Some time; but hearing a noise within, and no answer, they broke open the door with mnch difficulty, and entering,

went through a narrow passage in the rock. So strait that but one person could go abreast.. the end of which they came into Some strange rooms fastiioned by nature, thougte cleansed of moss and loose stones by labour: into these, light entered by the holes that were in Some places open through the top of the rocks; but Some part of the caves, or caverns, for they were Scarce fit to be called rooms, were very dark. In the biggest room was a lamp burning, and here they Saw two chests locked, and, bn a shelf Some platters and bowls made of calibasti shells, with two or three wooden Spits; and Some stickswere burning in a corner of the room, in a place made with stones piled round, and opening in the front like a furnace, on which stood a pot, wherein Something was boiling. There likewise hung up Some fishing tackle and a gun with a powder horn, as also a bow with a quiver of arrows. In a place which was shut with a door,
like

like a cupboard, stood bread and flower, and' on the table (for there was a very odd one, and stools, which which Seemed to be of the negro’s making) stood a basket with Some clean linen for a child, and Some canvas cut out for Slaves jackets and drawers. In another room they Saw a quilt and coverlids lying on Some rushes on the fioor; but they could find no living creature, at which they were much amazed. They called, and Spoke in the Softest terms, desiring them to come forth, if hid there, promising to do them no harm; but in vain. At last they heard a child cry, and following the sound of the voice, went through a narrow turning on she right hand, which brought them to a place where a door was shut, before which lay a terrible bear : Don Carlos, who was the foremost, carrying the lamp in one hand, and his Sword in she other, being presently more apprehensive of harriot’s danger than his own; the

being next behind him, ran at the bear, designing to kill it, if possible, before it could rise; but was stopped by the Sound of a human voice which came from that beast, saying, ‘ For ‘ heaven’s sake, spare my life, and * i’ll do all you’ll have me.’ At these words the negro came out of the bear’s skin, and threw himfelsat Don carlos’s feet, who took him up; anti Harriot bid him fear nothing, they. being persons in distress, that wanted bis assistance, and would pay him nobly for serving them. Then he •opened the door he had lain before in the beast’s skin, and brought forth the young woman and child, whom Harriot embraced, whilst the poor creature wept for joy to see a Qhristian white woman. Now they were all cheerful, and the negro being told, that they wanted his assistance, to carry one of them to any of the adjacent issands that was inhabited to get them some provisions, and hire a vessel to carry them to the istand of St. Domingo,

all impatient to know how this beautiful woman and black man came to this place; which they found she seemed not willing to declare whilst the negro was present; and therefore Harriot begged that she might accompany her whilst, he brought the boat round to the other fide of the istand, to take in one of the Sailors; ijot thinking it Safe to trust Don Carlos, or one of the gentlemen with him in so slight a vestel. This the negro did not seem to be pleased withal, but yet dared not refuse it. He used to drag his boat up out of the water into a cleft, where it was impossible to be Seen. And now the transported woman, with her tauny child, accompanied Harriot to her tent, and
in

in the way recounted her Sad story in these words;
‘ My name is Leonora: I am the daughter of a planter in Virginia, who has a great plantation there, is extremely rich; and having no more daughters than myself, bred me up in the best manner, Sending me to England for education, from whence I returned at thirteen years old. I was courted by Several, and by one in par i ticular whom I liked, and my father did not disapprove of; but it was my unhappy fate to be miserably disappointed of all my hopes. Amongst a great many negro staves whom my father had t work in our plantation, he you Saw was one, who appearing to be bred above the rest, and more capable of being Serviceable in the house, was taken into it. He was ■about twenty years old, handsome and witty, could read and write, having (as he pretends) been a prince in his ov/n country and taught Several

languages and arts by a Romish priest, who was cast ashore at Angola, from whence he came. He behaved himself So well, that he gained my father’s favour, and used often to wait on me when I walked out in an evening or rid out, running by my horfe’s fide; in short, he was ever ready to do me Service. We had a pleafure boat, having a city house at Jamestown;; when I was there, I used often, with my companions, to go on the water in the evenings for pleasure, and then he used to steer the boat. He made himself the little boat you fawhere, on pretence to go out a fishing for me, vshich much pleased my father, the fasliion and usefulness of it being extraordin.uy for it fails swift, and bears a rough Sea beyond anything we had ever seen. Fie used to catch fish very dex terously, as he did everything he went about: he coiild paint, understood navigation, the mathematics;

and, in short, was So beloved by my father, that he would have freed him, had he not feared losing of him. And now Domingo, for that is his name, became enamoured with me, and lift up his aspiring eyes to my unhappy face: his passion increased with time, and at last, he resolved to poffess me, or die in the attempt. Had he but once given me the least intimation of his passion, I should have acquainted my father with his insolence, and his death would have prevented my ruin : but this he knew, and therefore so well kept the secret to himself, that no body suspected it. He had taken care to provide some bread and money, by Selling Some tobacco, ahd little mathematical instruments and pictures he had made; my father, having given him a little piece of ground to plant, to buy him linen, allowing him to go finer dressed than other staves. He permitted him, when we went to the town, to Sell trifles that he made.

In fine, he waited only an opportunity to get me into his little boat, which he thus effedfed: one evening, the Sea being very calm, he Sat in the boat a fishing, having hid the bread and money in it; I walking down with my maid, to See what he had caught for my Supper, he persuaded me to step into the boat, and sit down. ‘ Now, Madam (Said he) ‘ you (hall See Sport.’ He was pulling in a little net; I Sat down, and the maid stood on the shore. He, in dragging the net, loosed the boat from the Shore, which beginning to drive out to Sea, surpriz’d me; but he bad me sit still, and fear nothing I Sat very patient for Some tirne, till at last Seeing him hoist the Sail, and go farther from land, I began to be frightened; he pretended to be So too, and persuaded me he could not help it, that the wind and stream drove the boat against his will. He pulled a little compass out of his pocket, by

At last he brought me hither half dead with the fright, and faint, having eat only a little of the bread, and drank out of the bottle of wine which he had in the boat,, in which he had put his tools for making mathematical instruments, and colours for painting. When we were landed, he Seemed mighty solicitous where to find a place for m to lie down, and food for me; and brought me into the cavern in the rock: there being Seated on his jacket, on the ground, we eat what fish he had in the boat, broiled on a fire he made wdth sticks, having a tinder bjox in his pocket.

When he foimd you were resolved to enter our being, which he thought Secure, he put me into the room you saw me in, and placed himself before it in the bear’s skin; a stratagem he had invented long before, fupposing no body would venture to Search farther, when they Saw So terrible a creature in So dismal a place. He had stuffed the legs, feet and head of the beast j So that placing himself in the belly of it, it appeared alive, espccially in So dark a place.

Domingo gladly accepted of this proposal,
being So overjoyed to hear that Leonora consented to marry him, he fell prostrate on the ground, and returned thanks to God in So passionate a manner, that it moved all the company. But Harriot, being still deeply Concerned for the loss of her dear Leander, feeing herself going to be carried to a place where she should be no longer able to resist Don carlos’s desires, where his father commanded everything, and from whence there was no peshbiiity to escape without

In a few hours they reached the istand, and Harriot was Gonduded by Don Carlos, to his father’s castle, where she was Surprised at the great attendance and Sumptuous furniture; the governor received his Son with great joy and affection, and when he presented Harriot to him, begging his bleshng and pardon for marrying without his eonsent, he took her up and embraced her. saying ‘ If She be as vir

The ball ended, she was by her husband conduced to a most splerir did apartment, attendedshy her father-in-law, sister, and all the eornpany. Here being again complemented, the company took leave, and an old lady with two waiting women, waited on her and Leonora into a dreffing room,, into which none but Leonora entered with them; the old lady undressed her, the strvants put her on a rich

St
new sister, whose beauty she much admired, and highly respedted her brother. Leonora had a fine Suit off night clothes, nightgown and petticoats given her also, and a chamber prepared next harriot’s to lie. in. Harriot was conducted by Lavinia to a bedchamber, where the bed was a rich brocade, the hangings arras, and everything magnificent beyond anything she had ever Seen in her life. So Soon as she was in bed, Lavinia and the rest took leave; then Don
Cartos came in at another door in his
nightgown, and went to bed to her; mean time the governor dismiffed the company,
and ' retired to his apartment.
Now it is fit that we inform ourselves where the Spanish captain aind the rest of the passengers were dish posed of; he, Domingo, and the osh

But Don Carloshaving thought it proper the Moor Should not appear with Leonora, till he had acquainted his father with their story; therefore it was resolved that he Should come to the governor’^ the next morning with the captain, who was obliged to wait on him, and give an account of his voyage every time he returned from Sea; domingo’s two chests, in which was all his wealth, were to be likev^ise brought to the castle: the Moor, who was mnich inclined to jealousy, pasted the night very ill, and thought the time long till the rising fun appeared; he had his little boy in bed with him, whom he hugged and kissed all night; and rising at day break, took a rich habit out of one of his chests, and dressed him felt like a petty prince, as he really was by birth in his own country; he

Thus he waited, ' ready to attend the captain and mon fieur Le Montague to the castle, to which they went about ten o’clock, by which time Don Carlos was risen, and had acquainted his father with leonora’s story and Monsieur Le Montague; the governor welcomed them ail, Domingo he embraced, and and promised him hk protection and favour. Don Carlos conducted him to Leonora and Harriot, who were together in their apartment entertaining a great many ladies, who were come to pay their compliments and breakfast with them. And now nothing but feasting and joy were thought on by all but these two ladies, who having been both bred Protestants, were in a great consternation

nation how they Should behave them selves. Harriot had reasqned that morning with her Lord on this sub jedf, and he had convinced her that She was under a necesiity of distem bling her religion; for if his father and family discovered She was a Protestant, She must expect to be hated and slighted, nay, that he Should be ruined, and perhaps parted from her, These thoughts almost distradled her, and She had communicated them Southeast

cretly to Leonora, when She came into her chamber^in the morning; they both wept, and found too late they must be of their husband’s religion, or be wretched. Harriot eveh repented her breach of faith with Leander, and began to apprehend the misfortunes that the change which she had made would bring upon her; but file concealed her thoughts, they went to mass every day, which made them highly caressed by the whole court, and much obliged their hufi bands,
Domingo,
 43
Domingo, who was impatient to retire with his wise, being very un easy at the liberties the gentlemen
took in looking on and talking to her,
solicited Don Carlos to procure him Some little Seat in the country, and had it forthwith granted; for the governor sent him to a little market town about twenty miles from the city, to a house of pleasure which he had there 3 and here he found a little paradise, a house so neat and richly furnished. Such lovely gardens, fish ponds, fountains, fields and groves, that his imagination could not have formed a more beautiful retreat. Having viewed it, and got all things ready, that is, two servants, and the room aired, he came back to the castle to fetch his wife, and return thanks for his fine being. But when Leonora took leave of Harriot, they both wept, and • Harriot promised to go every Summer and pafs her time there. Here Domingo and his little
family

family lived happily the remainder of their days, having many children, and Leonora by his persuafions, became a true Roman Catholic. But Harriot continued Some time a Protestant in her heart; yet at last She was truly happy in her own thoughts, and pleased Ihe was Don carlos’s wife; for She had all that mortal could wish for, a noble fortune, lovely children, and a husband who loved her beyond exprestion, and denied her nothing.
And now to return to the pirate captain, who was Safely landed on this issand, and cured of his wounds; the pirate ship which the Spanish captain had taken and sent away before, with the pirates he had taken aboard of it, being arrived at St. Domingo before his own ship : this gentleman, who was kept a prisoner in the town, hearing of Don carlos’s marriage
with Harriot, sent her a letter to ask
““•
her pardon for what was past, protesting he vas truly penitent, and that

he honoured her virtue as much as he had loved her person; and begged Ihe would procure his enlargement from that dismal place. This letter She Showed not her lord; but without relating what had passed between her and the pirate. Spoke in his behalf; and told him he was a Catholic, and a man nobly born, and forced against his will to become a pirate, and that Ihe begged the favour of him to release him, and Some way provide for him in the Fleet prison. This Don Carlos readily granted, and after Speaking to his father, went to the prison and released him and two other p entle

men whom he pleaded for, shying they were his countrymen and friends, and not guilty of any crimes but what they had been forced to. The common Sailors of the pirates were ordered on board the Spanish galleons, and these three gentlemen followed their benefadlor to the vol. I. ' H castle.

castle, to return their thanks to die governor. Don Carlos presenting them to his wife and father, Harriot ■looked on the pirate captain with Some disorder; but he addressed himself to her in these words, ‘mak ing a profound bow, ‘ Madam, I ‘ am doubly indebted to you both ‘ for my liberty and reformation; I
* am by your reproofs and generosity' ' from both the means and •
inclinations to sin, and now resolve ‘ to live So, that my actions may
* witness my love to God, and gra ‘ titude to you. I will henceforth < endeavour to be an honour to my ‘ country and religion.’ This Speech much pleased her, who perfedfly understood his meaning; and in a stiort time after, the governor gave him a commission of a captain who died in the garrison, and he married a mercbanfs widow in the town, who brought him a great fortune. His twq companions, according to the
custom
 47
custom of the irish, made their fortunes there also, and Settled in that island.
Monsieur Le Montague being highly caressed by Don Carlos, and all his friends, as being Harriot's near kinsman, soon obtained money and a Ship to go to Canada in search of Clementina, promising to stop at
that island in his return, besore he went home to France.
But to return to the unfortunate Leander whom we left at Virginia, much indisposed, which prevented him from coming to St. Domingo for sometime.
Leander, after ten month’s fick ness, being recovered, employed his kinsman Lewis Dumarefque to hire a

in a deep consumption, and had ' been So kind to him, that he was obiiged to withdraw himsels with great reluctance; and had he known Harriot was ciisposed of, no doubt but he would have married this unfortunate lady, who now dearly paid for her parting him from her rival; for She had like to have died with grief after he left her. His kinsman got a bark, and acquainted his father with their designs, who, to forward it, having nothing to object against it. Since Leander and the lady were contracted, as he assured him they were, took Madam, Camilla with him to a lady’s, who was related to him, and had a fine plantation not far from his, per suading her it would be good for her health to Slay there a few days. Leander promised to fetch her home fpon, and taking leave of her, found himself in So great disorder, that he

was like to Swoon, conscious that he defigred to See her no more; and stung with a sense of his ingratitude to her who So pastionateiy loved him, he was in the utmost disorder. She likewise, as if apprehensive of
her misfortune, let fall a shower of tears: thus parted, never to meet again, as he fupposed. He went aboard with his kinsman, and Set sail for the istand, where he was to meet with greater misfortunes thai. he ever yet met with. So Soon as the ship was gone off the coast, mon er Dumarefque, leander’s uncle, who was a widower, and was fallen in love with Camilla, glad of this opportunity (as he hoped) to cure her of her pashon for his nephew, rid over to his kinfwoman’s, where he had two days before left her, to acquaint her with his being gone, aggravating the baseness of his leaving her thus treachcroussy,, and vile in gratitude to her: but she, as one

She fainted away, and was carried to her chamber, where the lady' of the house endeavoured all she was able to comfort her; and to her She related all her story, not concealing the Subtle stratagem she had made use of to get Leander from her rival, saying, his but just that I should suffer for my crime and folly in persevering to love him, who cannot return it as he ought. She So abandoned herself to these thoughts, that her sickness daily increased, and they despaired of her continuing long alive. She was very sensible of her own condition, and seemed much pleased with the thoughts

of death';, for besides the loss of the luati She So excestively loved, the shnse she hast of her own folly, and the desperatenefs of her circumstances, being left in ^ stranger’s ear, with whom indeed Leander had left money to provide for, and carry her home, to France; but thither She was ashamed to return; besides, it might be long e’er her health would permit her to take Such a voyage. All thesc Slid rdledions overwhelmed her, and bad doubtless
killed her, had not Providence mercifully prolonged her life to be happy, Monsieur dumarefqueshew cd the greatest concern and affection for her that a man could pofiibly make appear; profefiing he desired
no greater happiness on earth than the continuance of her life, and would give all his fortune to Save her. All the physicians of note in the place were made use of, and at last, art and nature joined together, raised

her from her sick bed; and then reason took place over fancy, and ihe hearkened to dumaresque’s proposal, wliose generosity put in the balance tvith leander’s ingratitude, and the imposhbility of her being his, prevailed with her to accept of his oii er. Thus she was happily pro ^ for, and Leander lost great part of his uncle’s fortune which he had dehgned to give him, never designing to marry again, till he Saw this young lady, by whom he had many fine children to inherit what lie could settle on them, without injuring his eldest fon, which was very considerable.
In few days after his departure, Leander arrived safely with his kinsman at the island of St, Domingo, and being a stranger there, got the captain of the bark, who vas used to trade there, to take them a lodging, thinking it most prudent not to appear too openly in a place where
his

his rival’s father was governor, till ‘ he had got information how Harriot was drsposed of; which he Soon learned to his inexpressible grief: for his kinsman making inquiry after her of the captain of the ship that brought her thither, whom he met with at a coffeehouse to; which he was directed; he told him of her marriage and good fortune as he termed it. And, indeed. So it was, had her lover never come to ruin her peace. Leander was quite distradled with this news; his kinsman wisely advised him to return to Virginia, and never lee her. She cannot be blamed. Said he, Ihe wasi left in your rival’s power, and has wisely chose rather to marry, and be his wife with honour, than to be his mistress by compulsion, and be ruined; and now it would be cruel and ungenerous to revive her grief by Seeing her: befidcvs, Should her

This, and a thousand things more, he said to persuade him to be gone; but all to no purpose: : was deaf as the winds, and behaved himself like a madman. At last he resolved to go to the church she used on festival days, difguised in a Spanish habit, which the captain of the bark procured him, and have a sight of her, promising not to attempt to speak to her. It was the cathedral church and the Sunday following, Leander, who had not stirred out of his lodging from the day of his arrival,, which was on the Wednesday before, went with his kinsman to the. high mafs, where he Saw his lovely Harriot, who was great with, child, standing by her husband and father-in-law near the altar, and the lovely Lavinia by her, four crimfoa

She was dressed in a Spanifii dress, rich as art could make it, and had Store of jewels in her hair and on her breast; thus adorned, he thought her more beautisul than ever, and felt Such tortures in his soul, that he could not govern his pafiion, but dropped downdn a Swoon, : which occasioned Some disorder among the people; the crowd was So great, that he could not be carried out, but was unfortunately brought near the rails : Harriot turning her head. Soon knew his face, gave a great Shriek, and Swooned, falling back into one of the chairs. Don carlos’s jealousy was presently awakened, and he too truly guested who was in the church.; but leander’s kinsman very prudently, fearing a discovery, got him carried out into the air, and muffling his fac: e up in his cloak, led him home to

' Harriot fainting, was supposed to be occasioned by her being Surprised at the noise in the church, or with heat, being with child; this past with all but her lord, who, upon her recovering, led her to his coach, and went home with her, being impatient to question her what She Saw: that So much disordered her; she Said she thought the Spaniard that sainted, was So like Leander,. that being: Surprised, she could not but be So discompofed. He deiired her to go no more into public assemblies till She was up again; resolving in himself to Set Such Spies at work, that if Leander was arrived there, he. should Soon be Sent farther off, or dispatched.

tisfied of the truth, and had Secured his rival. It was not many hours before those he Set at work to discover who this person was that had occasioned this disorder in the church, informed him, that two gentlemen were arrived in a ship from Virginia, and lodged privately in the town; that one of them made inquiry after Harriot, meeting the Spanish captain at the coffeehouse. In fine, his lufpicions were now confirmed, and he persuaded Harriot to go to domingo’s in the country, to pass a month with Leonora, saying, it would be better for her to be in a place where she would be freed from receiving ceremonious visits, and could better in' ' herself in that sweet retirement; and that she should continue there till she was near her time, if she pleased. She willingly consented, being now deeply melancholy,, .and. glad of an opportunity to be

alone with her dear friend Leonora; to whom She could unbosom her thoughts. He carried her thither, and lest her,, pretending he had bu fincss that obliged him to return to his father; concluding in his own thoughts, that Leander, who no doubt was impatient to speak with her, would Soon learn where She was, follow her, and venture to pay her a visit, he being absent; The old lady or governess, who attended her, was his creature, and he left her a Spy on all her atstions. He took his leave as usual, with all the tenderness and concern imagine able; Saying, he Should think each day a year till he returned, to her. All things were tranladted as he foresaw; Leander learning he was absent, and Harriot at the country house, went with, bis friend disguised in their Spanish dresses, to the village where she was, and took a lodging in a peasancs house, where

they kept very private for two days; then his friend and kinsman, who ventured abroad for intelligence, being certain that he was not known by Don Carlos, having Seen her walking, in the garden with Leonora, informed him of it; so they consulted what to do : and Leander, fearing to Surprise her a Second time, resolved to write a letter to her, and Sent it by his friend : the contents of which were as follow.
Sill charming tho’ perjur’d Harriot,

Ishis letter was delivered into harriot’s hand by dumaresqne the next morning : for he ventured to go iiitp the gardens before day over the stone wall, and there hid himself in a summerhouse till Harriot came into the garden to walk with her friend Leonora alone. He took this, as he tfiought, lucky opportunity, and at their coming into the summerhouse to sit down, presented himself and the letter to her. She
s
was a little startled, but believing Leander was not gone from the issand. She expected to hear from or See him, concluding he would by Some means or other find a way to send or come to her; so she immediately guested who he came from. She read the moving lines, and Shedding a stood of tears. Said, ‘ Sir, ‘ tell the unfortunate Leander it ‘ was his misfortune, not my fault, ‘ that we are Separated; his leaving ^ me, put me under a fatal necestity

At these words she rose, and went out of the summerhouse, leaving Leonora to let him out at the back gate with a key which she always carried in her pocket, to let them into a grove, which was behind the garden. Leonora hastened him a way, entreating him never more to return. Harriot retired to her closet, and there gave way to her passion;; love to Leander was now revived, and she had the most dreadful apprehensions of his danger that can be conceived. She perused the dear lines he had Sent her a hundred tiines over, and washed them pale with her tears. Whilst she was thus employed, Don Carlos, who had laid all the time in the village, and had received information of the stranger’s lodging at the peafant’s, and of dumarefque’s being in the
gardsa

garden (Harriot having been watched by the old Dovegna) knocked at the closet door : She asked who was there; and hearing his voice, dapt the letter into her bosorn, and opened the door in Such a disorder that her lord would have been much Surprised at, if he had not known the cause of it before. He took her in his arms with a forced air of affection, but his eyes fiashed with rage; he trembled, and Spoke in So distraded a manner, that She too well perceived he was informed of what had past, and was So overcome with grief, that she fainted in his arms: he laid her gently on the couch, and took the letter out of her bosom, read it and putting it there again, called the old governess who waited without, and presently fetched cordials to bring her to herself; but they tried all means in vain So long, that he thought her dead, and indeed began to abandon

hirrisdf to passion: Leonora, who had retired into her chamber, Seeing Don Carlos go into the apartment as Ihe was going to give Harriot an account that the gentleman was gone away in sasety, shearing his complaints, came in, and also thought her dead: the physicians were called, and by their aid She was brought to lise, but immediately fell in labour, being Seven months gone with child. This caused a great deal of confusion in the family, where nothing was prepared for her lying in, it being dessgned to be in the castle with the utmost magnificence. At three in the afternoon She was delivered of a Son, who lived but a few hours, and was therefore by the physicians advice baptised So soon as it was born. Don Carlos was highly asbidled at his own imprudence in Surprising her, and strewed the utmost tenderness and concern for her, kneeling by

her bedside on the floor, kissing her hands, professing that he loved and valued her above all earthly things, and could not live without her; till at last the physicians in treated him to quit the room, and leave her to repose : So the chamber being darkened, and none but nurses ^ left to attend her, poor Harriot was delivered up to her own Sad thoughts, which Soon threw her into a fever that had like to have ended her life. And now Don Carlos was ten times more enraged against Leander than before, - looking upon him as the cause of his child’s death, and perhaps of his beloved Harriot, for which he now resolved to be revenged of him. In order to this, he immediately Set four bravoes, whom he had before hired, and placed ready to Seize him, to watch his lodgings: they were all disguised, and hid themselves in a field behind
the peasant’s house; towards the
'dusk

vfiusk of the evening they perceived Leander and his friend go forth, and take the way to domingo’s; they followed, and So soon as they saw them enter the grove, seized them, 'His kinsman bad dissuaded him from this attempt all he was able, but he was determined to see Harriot or die; and since his friend had So easily got to the Speech of her, flattered himself he fhouid have the same good fortune: but when he found himself Seized by villains, gagged and bound with his generous friend, who was like to be made a sacrifice by his folly, he bitterly repented his rashnefs. They were thrown across a horse, like calves, their legs and hands being fastened with a cord under the horfe’s belly, a fumpter horfe cloth was thrown over them, and thus they were carried all night, guarded by the four bravoes, who were well armed, and had a pass from the governor’s
i68 The H I S TO RY OF
vernor’s Son, So that none offered to stop them. By break of day they arrived at an old castle, well fortified, on the north fide of the ifiand, where an officer and twelve Soldiers were in garrison, who had received orders before what to do with these unfortunate gentlemen, whom he was to keep Secure in the castle dungeon, being pirates, desperate villains, and reserved to make discovcries by the rack, if they would not do it voluntarily. Don Carlos confirmed all this to the officer by a letter he Sent him Some days before : into the dungeon they were accordingly carried, put in irons, and left to live upon the allowance the officer was ordered to give them, which was very Sufficient: for Don Carlos was not willing to load his conscience with the guilt of murdering them, but only desired to Secure his own repose and his wife’s honour, and would willingly have Sent them

To leander’s friend he had .no prejudice 5 nay, he rather had an esteem for him, for the generous ■ friendship he had shown in rishing his life for his friend. thcse gen > thus Secured, the bravoes went back to Don Carlos, who on this news was more at ease, and applied his whole thoughts about harriot’s indisposition. She was many days light headed, calling often upon Leander, which stabbed him to the heart.' It Was more than six months before she was able to go out of her chamber. In this time she often asiced Leonora if she could hear pothin'g of him. Sometimes she flattered herself that he had prudently took her advice, and left the island;; inwardly reproached him with want of astedfion: tiien reflecting bn his daring temper and vol, L I con

constancy, which his venturing thither after her did evidence, She concluded he had heard of her illness,
«
and lay still concealed there : then She trembled with the thoughts of his being discovered, or ruining himself and her by venturing to Speak to her; another while She feared he was murdered. So Soon as'tshe
e
was able, Don Carlos carried her to the castle, where his father received her with much joy, and all the ladies paid her visits, congratulating her recovery. The Ship that brought Leander, Set Sail, having waited two months, and returned to Virginia, at which his uncle and Camilla was much Surprised; but concluded that (mad with his disappointment) he was gone home to ‘france j and they were much concerned at young pumaresque’s not returning or writing; but were fain to rest Satisfied, expecting to hear from them.

When the wretched Leander saw himself and his friend in this distnal place, no words can express the, tortures or his mind; and indeed it was a providence he was at that time fettered, ur elfe his despair might have drove him to destroy himself; he Sighed deeply, and the big drops ran Scalding down his cheeks; grief had so benumbed his faculties, that his tongue could not utter one word; so that he remained filent, with his eyes fixed on his friend, who bore his afflictions calmly; for he had not love and despair to combat, had lost no mistress, loved his friend, and had a Soul so generous, that he was even glad, fiiice it was his fate to be thus confined, that he was a partner of his fortune, and reserved to comfort him in that place.

events; but the damp unwholesome vapours in the dungeon threw them both into Such an illness, taking away the use of their limbs, that the commanding officer, who was a Frenchman, Sent to Don Carlos, to know what he should do with them; assuring him they would die, if not Soon removed: on which he tent orders to him, to remove them to an apartment on the top of the castle, where they might walk on the battlements

At last he contradfed So great a friendship with them, that he Said he would willingly free them, could he be assured he Should not lose his eommiffion by it: but it would not be long, he supposed, before he ffiould be relieved by another officer and band of Soldiers, it being customary for the garison to be changed every six months; and then he would furniffi them with ropes tolet themselves down from the

They not only thanked, him in the most expressive terms, but promised if they ever lived to reach Virginia again, to show their gratitude: and he promised to give them intel: : of whatever befell Harriot, by the captain who brought them thither, whom they resolved to send to that issand yearly, he giving them a diredsion where they Should always inquire for him. This concluded on, Leander and his kinsman grew cheerful.
O
At last orders coming for the off ficer to' depart thence, he faithfully performed all he had promised, leaving them ropes and red coats; nay,, when he took his leave, which he did with much affection, he presented Leander with a good purse of gold, which he had much ado to make him accept ol.

The very night aster the captain wa gone they made their escape, young dumaresque’^s kinsman venturing down first from the battlements, having Sworn his friend Should not venture till he had tried the danger > for it was a vast height from whence, they descended, and had the rope broke he had run a great risque of lostng his life.

took them up to their breasts, and the waves beat So strong, that they had much ado to reach the shore; from whence they fled to the wood,, and pasted through it to the other fide : there sheltered by the trees from the view of the garrison, they stood a while to See what boats lay on the shore; and choosing Such a one as they thought they were able to manage, and launch into the Sea without help, they dragged it into' it, hoisted Sail,, and put off. But.
, alas! their condition was worse than ever, they knew not well how to steer the boat, and were So weak and tired before, that' they could Scarce row or guide it. They had no provision aboard but a little bis ket and Salt meat, that they found stowed in the fisherman’s locker in

Spaniards; they steered for Jamaira,.
from vrhence they were certain they could get a passage to Virginia, where Leander resolved to remain with his uncle and friend till Harriot was dead, or a widow; and never to return to France again without her, whilst she was living. They were in sight of Jamaica, when the wind began to blow and the waters foam: then a terrible storm began, which drove them for four nights and days quite out of their Smowledge; in which time their provisions were Spent, and their strength so decayed, that they were forced to lie down, and leave themselves to Providence. But nothing assiivsted them so much as thirstall their fresh water was gone, and drinking fait, so increased their drought, that they feared to repent It. Thus they continued for three days more drove by the winds and waves : iu these three days hunger

.So pressed them, that they ransacked every corner of the boat to find a morsel to eat, and devoured every bit of mouldy biscuit they could find : but, alas! that was So little, it only tantalised, not Satisfied their craving stomachs. And now they began to reflect, that it had been better for them to have continued prisoners, than have exposed themselves to Such miseries. Thus experience tells us, that when we have obtained our own wishes, not easy in the state Providence has placed us in, we are more unhappy than we were before. Isle generous Montandre begged his kinsman to kill him, and preserve his own life, by Seeding on his warm flesh, and Sucking his blood. Saying, ‘ We must now both inevitably perish, ‘ unless one Supply the other’s ‘ wants*’ Leander was So shocked at this proposal, that his very Soul shivered. ‘no, (Says he) before I

Sucking the warni blood and raw flesh more greedily than ever they had done the most delicious food prepared for them. This greatly refreshed them, and towards Sun setting the wind abating, they laid by their oars, and fell to eating more of the raw fish, but Sparingly, not knowing how long they hast to live upon it. Whilst they were at this strange Supper they Spied land, on which they applied themselves afresti to their oars, and about midnight:

The HISTORY or
a merchant took them into his house, where he entertained them very ge neroufiy, and invited them to continue there till they could find means to go to Virginia, telling them it was their best way to do So by Some trading vessel, which he supposed they must wait Some time for. This merchant had a bark ready to sail with goods for Carolina, from whence it would not be very difficnlt for them, to go by land to Virginia : he offered them a passage in this strip, which they gladly accepted of; and in few days went aboard, and got Safe to Carolina. They hired a guide to conduct them through the country to Virginia; but pasting by the Apalatteau mountains, a party of Indians came down upon them, and carrying them away over the mountains, plundered them of their money and clothes.
Amongst these Indians they continued in the greatest misery, being
obliged

obliged to live after their barbarous fashion as staves; till going out with a party to cut fuel in the thick woods, they took their opportunity to make their escape, being desperate, and hid themselves in a cave in the night, choosing rather to venture being devoured by wild beasts, ■ than Spend their lives in stavery. They lay concealed in this place till the Indians were gone farther on; then, destitute of food, and in their staves dress, they stead towards one of the Spanish forts, which they could never have reached, had they not met with an old hermit, who lived in a poor cottage near a wood : he was standing at his door, and feeing two poor staves, who looked like death, come towards him, supposed they were in want and chrif tians. So invited them in, to their great Surprise, and gave them bread and drink, ashing where they were going. They gave him the account,

that they were cast away in a stiip^ Saved in a fistiing boat near the ha vanna, driven on the coast of Ju ' cattan; from thence went in a bark to Carolina, and going across the countries for Virginia, were taken and made staves; and wearied with the miseries they endured, were now endeavouring to eseape to Fort philip. He told them, he would conduct them thither in Safety the next morning. They staid with him ■ all night, lying on straw (as he did) with warm coverlids: and being: very importunate to know the reasons of his living this Solitary life,
he told them his story in these
words.

I am, laid he, by birth a Frenchman; I was the younger fon of a eounfellof,, who had a great estate, and was put in a good post under my father So Soon as I was able to understand business, having a clerk’s place in the salt office. Here being

from under my father’i eye, I contracted an intimacy with a young gentlewoman who lived with her aunt, a person who, tho’ v/ell born, was fallen to decay, and they maintained themselves by their needles, and Some Small income the aunt had left, very genteely, but with much difficulty. It was my fortune to see this young woman at church, fly was very beautiful and genteel, I followed her home, made love ta her, and was well received. I pretended an honourable affection j but, alas, had no other design in mw wicked heart but to debauch her. Their circumstances made them willingly receive the presents and treats 1 gave them, not thinking it
dishonourable, since I pretended
maariage; glad was the innocent creature to be provided for: their conversation was charming, and their conduct So reserved and modest, that I was a great while before

I could venture to make any attempt upon her virtue; but then I was repulsed with Such Scorn and reproofs, that I almost despaired of efedting my base design; but knowing that it would be my ruin if I married her, and being now so much in love, that I knew not how to live without her, I still perfisted in my visits and importunities, and though refused the sight of her frequently, and always received with reproaches, yet I could not desist; and finding all my attempts were in vain, and that I could not Seduce her to my will, at last I consented to marry her privately, on condition that she Should keep it a Secret. This She gladly consented to, and so we were married by a Cordelier who was her confessor: and then I was made happy in the possession of my dear Flavia, who was the most virtuous - and most charming woman breathing. He h shed Some tears, and
could

could Scarce go on; but recovering, he condnued his discourse. thus : and now, gentlemenj I am going to relata a part of my life, that fills my Soul with horror, and will, I hope, deter all that hear it from committing such crimes: we past Some months as happily as we could wisli, and stie grew great with child; but my expenses increasing, and a pro speds of more charges coming on, made me grow Something uneasy; to add to which, my father began to press me about a marriage that wss proposed to him much to my advantage. Tins put anxious thoughts into my head, and made me^refiedf how imprudent I had been : my eager desires were Satisfied, my love diminished, as my ambition and avarice were encreased; and in fine, I wished her dead, and meditated on nothing but how to get rid of her. Thus my disobedience in marrying without my father’s knowledge

ledge and consent, drew down heaven’s anger upon me, and the devil tempted me oh to proceed to luore liagrant crimes. I did not visit my
wife So often as usual, but humoured my father in visiting the young lady proposed to me, who was every way agreeable, and had the most prevailing argument on her fide to engage man’s inconstant heart, that is, a great fortune: she was the only daughter of a rich banker, had taken a fancy to me, and her parents dote ing on her, resolved not to cross her, for which reason they made the proposal to my father: Such advances were made on their fide, that I could find no pretence to delay the marriage longer. And now I foresaw that I must either incur my father’s hatred, and be ruined, (for he was a man of an implacable temper, and would, I knew, abandon me, if he discovered my marriage) or else that I must rid myself of
Flavia

Fkvia forthwith, and then 1 might be great, and, as I vainly flattered myself, happy.this wicked thought I indulged, and long revolved in my mind, till at last I reshlved to put it in execution; and though I was grievously tormented in my conscience, yet I persevered in this wicked design, and bought poison, which I made an infusion of in wine, and putting it into a vial in my pocket, I went to my virtuous wife to lie all night: she received me with open arms; I appeared more cheer full and kind than usual; we Supped, and after supper, I pretended I was not well, and desired we might have some burnt wine, which her aunt presently got: I Slily poured the poison into the cup, which I presented to my dear wise, pretending She and her aunt must drink with me; they readily complied, always studying to oblige me : but
when I Saw Flavia Swallow it, mv

Soul Slfivered, my conscience flew in my Sace; and when She came and kissed me as I was going to bed,
I felt tortures not to be expressed, or indeed conceived, but by Such - wretches as myself. She had not lain long in my arms, but convulsions Seized her nerves, and I called her aunt and Servant up, showing the greatest concern; but neither of them fufpedfed what was the matter, nor need I counterfeit, for at that instant I was filled with Such horrors, that I would have given the whole world to Save her. From this moment my peace was broke, and I became the most miserable man breathing. She expired in my ’arms before day, with the dear murdered infant in her; saying the kindest things to me, and praying form even in the last agonies ot death. The innocent Flavia thus ^ dispatched, I took leave, giving money to her aunt (who was almost distracted with grief) to bury her.

They had kept a maidservant ever Since my marriage, and I left them in the house, and excused myseif irom being present at her burial, lest my father Should hear of it; promising the aunt to be always kind to her. Having left these melancholy objects, I went to the tavern, drank a quart of wine to revive my Spirits, and then went home to my father’s. And now my whole busi ness was to divert my thoughts as much as possible; I went abroad every day, drank, danced, went to the play, and So lulled myself with variety of pleasure, that the terrors of my conscience were Something Silenced. The impressions of flavia’s murder wore off, and I was married; but the bridal night I was no Sooner in bed, and the candles extingnistied, than, as I was going to take my bride in my arms, the curtain at my bed’s head was drawn back; and turning my head, I ima vol, I, K gined

gined I Saw the fae Flavia standing by my fide, big with child, and the fatal vial in her hand, which she Seemed to shake, and looked upon - me with a look that struck quite through my Soul; the cold Sweat trickled down my face, and the bed Shook Under me; every nerve shivered as if the agonies of death had Seized me. Thus 1 lay with my eyes shut, not daring to lift up my eyelids, till the daybreak had freed me from this dreadful vision, which made Such an imprefiion on my soul, that I fancied her ever in my sight, and could not relish nor take any Satisfaction in anything I pofiefied. I concealed this from the world, and did all that was possible to oblige my new wife, who was doatingly fond of me, and had brought me So great a fortune, that we wanted nothing that wealth could purchase, to make us happy in a moderate way of life. But

wealth could not cure my wounded conscience, I had a load of guilt upon my Soul, and was continually upon the rackthis Soon destroyed my health, andffo afstidted her, that She was almost as unhappy as myself. Being through great weak ness, attended with an intermitting fever, confined .to my bed, L fc riousty prepared for death, and con fested myself to a I'rancifcan, a man of great wisdom and piety, who So eloquently laid before me the enormity of my crime, the terrors of eternal punishment, and the infinite mercies of God, on a sincere repentance, that I heartily lamented my Sins, and endeavoured to reconcile myself to God; on which he was ' pleased to raise me up again, and prolong my life. My wife was now great with child, and had never had the smallpox, which she unfortunately caught by going to an opera, where she Saw a person

newly recovered; and at her coming home was taken ill, and died of them. Being now left a widov/er, the thoughts I had had in my late fickness, came a fresh into my mind, and I resolved to retire from the world; but my father and friends much opposed it, being desirous I ’ Should marry again, because my elder brother was consumptive, and, though married Seven years, had no child. The prospedl of having all my father’s fortune prevailed with me not to enter into the church or any religious communitybut being Sfill uneasy in my mind, thinking I ought to do Something to atone for my sins, I resolved to retire to Some reinote part of the world to do penance for them by fasting, and prayers, and alms deeds. I therefore put all my estate into my confessor’s hands, to distribute the income of it every year to the poor,

My poverty and manner, of living makes the Indians never molest me, nay, they dove me, and Supply me with anything I want: besides I am a kind of physician amongst them; for having took delight in studying physic, I am arrived to Some knowledge in it, and well acquainted with the nature and life of ail the medicinal herbs that grow in these parts. I am also part of a Surgeon, and dress their wounds'and sores, and by this means have many opportunities of Saving the bodies and souls, by instructing them in the Christian Saith.

Then they relate d the particulars of their adventures; and rising as soon as day appeared, fet out together for Fort philip, resolv
to go to Virginia by the first opportunity, whence De Lille might easily get passage to France, being

his injured Flavia. Being arrived at Fort philid, they were kindly entertained by tke hermits friend, furnished them with clothes, and a guide, with Some Soldiers to guard them to Virginia, and protect them from the Indians. This officer being acquainted with his friend’s story and leander’s, gave them money to defray their charges on the way to Virginia, from whence Leander promised to furnish De Lisle with all necessaries for his return to France.
And here we shall leave these gentlemen, to inquire what is become of Monsieur Le Montague harriot’s kinsman, whom she met with in the cottage on the desolate island, and brought with her to the istand of St. Domingo, from whence he went in a bark to Canada in Search of Clementina. He arrived Safe at Quebeck, where he was informed

An opportunity for this he quickly found, and got Safe thither in a French merchant ship. At his arrival he found hia eldest brother dead, and

He well knew it was in vain for him to attempt a farther Search for her, and therefore retired to a little seat in the country, where he gave himself up to contemplation, and lived the life of a man that had quitted the world; whilst poor Clementina being niade a stave, was sold by the Algerine pirate to the bay of Tunis; whose steward, a Moor, that used to purchase the handsome European virgins for his master, bought her, and carried her home to his Seraglio.

But now he was also a stave, and punished for his crime. The virtuous Clementina thus lodged in the Seraglio, with others as unhappy as herfels, being
a lady of an heroic Spirit and consummate virtue, bravely resolved to die, rather than stabmit to a Mahometan; and thus determined, began to constder what to do to deliver herself; in order to which (he thought it best to apply herself to one of those unfortunate beauties, who seemed well acquainted with that place and life, appearing to have

I A M the daughter of a noble. Venetian, my brother is a knight of Malta, my name is Mariana
I was placed in a monastery as a pensioner, being but twelve years old; there a young gentleman courted me Secretly, the younger fbn of a noble family, who was a captain in the service of the state, and had no other for tunebut his commistion, which indeed was Sufficient to fupportshim nobly, but ' vol. II B was

was not considerable enough to answer that great fortune my father defign’d me, or to answer his and my brother’s ambitious expectations, I being an only daughter. This gen \ tieman’s person and sense gain d my affection. So that I preser’d him in my heart before all others, gave him my hand and promise to be his; but it was not long e’er it was discoverd that Some conversation had pass’d between us, and I was Sent for home
and question’d, but confefs’d nothing. This distracted my lover, and he was impatient at' my being kept from him: So that at last he made use of a stratagem to get me, which he thus effected : He sent me a letter by a servant to my father’s, which he doubted not would be intercepted; in which he acquainted me, after abundance of pastionate asturances, that he would ever love me; that fearing I foster’d much constraint and unea stnefs on his account, he was refolv d
to sell his post, and go for Spain, hav
 J
ing Some great relations there by his mother’s fide, who was a spanish lady, by whose interest he doubted not to get a better post; and this was the most generous proof he could give me of his affections, being refolv’d to make himself miserable to render me happy. My father, who broke open this letter, was very glad, and had me narrowly watch’d, till he saw that he did what he pretended, which he quickly did; for he sold his post, and took leave of his friends, and went aboard a stiip for Spain, as he pretended. Then I was sent back to the monastery, where I Soon receiv’d a letter from him by means of another penlioner who was our confident; in which he inform’d me, that he lay conceal’d at a village hard by, and that he conjur’d me to get away with the first opportunity, and come to him This I did the next evening at the close of the day, and got safe to his friend’s house where he was conceal’d.
Here he receiv’d me with open arms,

and his friend’s chaplain married US that night. We Went away thence before day the next morning, in his igoach, which carry’d us to the port where the ship’s boat lay ready to receive us, he having hir’d the vessel on purpose. We went aboard, weigh’d anchor, and Set sail for Barcelona; but before w could reach that port,
* we were urifortunately taken by an Algerine pirate, and brought to this dlfmal place, where I was parted from him, and sold to this vile infidel, to whose curs’d bed I have been forc’d, and have had the misfortune to be lik’d. He has been absent these four months, being gone to his country seat to pafs the summer feafon, where he has other wretched women to divert him; he is to return hither in three days, and then you must be a victim to his lust no question.
- Here stie let fall a stood of tears, and Clementina bore her company. ‘ You have, said She, told me a story. ‘ more unhappy than my own, since

I have still preserv’d my virtue, and ^ am now resolved rather to die than ‘ yield, since providence grants me ‘ three days for my escape. i’ll use ‘ that time, and bravely venture to ‘ get hence, or die in the attempt; if ‘ you will venture with me, speak, i’ll ‘ lead the way, death is preferable to ‘ such a life as this “You say you “are a Christian, heroic maid, said' ' “would you commit self murder?

Could we get the habit of an eunuch for each of us, it would be the ‘ safest disguise we could put on; the ‘ Bey being absent, few of his fer ‘ vants left here, and those left on

Being thus refolv’d, they waited till night came on, when hearing all things still, Clementina crept to her friend’s chamber, who had bundled up her jewels and Some linen : they got down from the window, and then went to the wa rdrobe, the moon Shining very bright, and were Some time before they could get in at the window, it being very high; but at last clemeritina’s wit, which 'exceeded her Sex (tho’ women ever were esteem’d more quick and Subtle than mankind at cunning plots and quick contrivances) Soon found the way to enter; She got on mariana’s shoulders, and went in there trembling; she got two rich vests, two turbants, two pair of Turkish boots, and a box, whose rich outfivde and weight, though small, made her be

She took down two rich fcymiters that hung up in fine embroider’d belts, and having drawn one, pafs’d through the chamber where the eunuchs lay fast asteep, resolving if they stirr’d, to kill them, or to die by their hands. Upon the table there stood a stiver bowl half full of wine, of which no doubt they had took their fill, although their prophet does forbid st them; for fewmuf felmen refuse to drink it in private: this bowl She took, with a bunch of

Clementina fhew’d her the keys, one of which stie fancy’d would open the garden gate, to which they hasted, and to their great fatisfacftion found it so : being got out of the gate, ' which they lock’d after them, they stood to confider which vyay to go, and refolv’d to get away from the town to. the next wood or rush’d building they could meet with; they had not gone above two miles, when they enter’d a grove, at the farther end of which they found an old ruin’d mosque, which they went into with great fear, lest some old Turkilh Brahmen or Saintoin Should live there; but hear shg no creature stir but bats and screech owls, and Such vermin as live in unfrequented places, they took courage, and the day beginning to break, they laid down their bundles, and changing their clothes, put on ' their Turkifb habits, which instead of being mean, such as staves wear, be --

long’d to the Bey himself, being both cloth of gold, the buttons of the one was rubies, and the other emeralds; the turbants were suitably rich, and full of diamonds, pearls, and other jewels; So that they had an immense treasure, had they known how to dispose of it. But at this time they would willingly have parted with it all for some poor habit to conceal them, fearing they Should be piirfu’d and taken, not knowing where to hide themselves: They were weary, saint, and had no food, and search’d every corner of this ruinous place to hide themselves;; last they found a door which seem’d to lead down Some stairs into a vault, where they suppos’d the dead were bury’d, and that they Should meet with nothing there but skulls and bones and noisom vapours; yet had they had a light, they would gladly have gone into it to hide themselves, nay liv’d, and chose to steep and eat amongst the dead, rather than to live luxuriousty with infidels. They sat

down upon the stairs however to rest their tivd limbs; So that is any Should pass by, they might Shut the door upon them. As they Sat thus Con suiting what to do, they heard a noise, and Saw a man enter the mosque with a dark lanthorri in his hand and a loaf under his arm, with Some Scraps of meat, and fish in a little basket; he had a long coarse frize garment on, his face and hands were tawny, he had only Sandals on his feet, and a strange fashioffd straw hat upon his head; he sat down his basket and. bread, and opening his lantern, turning the light fide towards them, came to the door, and was going downstairs, when Mariana giving a great stiriek, fell into a Swoon upon Clementina, and had like to have beat her down the stairs. It is impostible to express her thoughts at this instant; for though She was a woman of great, Courage, and had a dauntless soul, yet stie was fhock’d at the instant, as whs also the stranger. He looked upon

them with amazement; the beauty of their Saces, the Splendour of their habits, and the strange place he found them in, astonish’d him. Clementina at last recovering herself, view’d him attentively, and reason’d with herself that he was but a man unarm’d, and in all probability as much in distress as themselves; mean time he concluded they were women disguis’d, and doubtless fled thither for Shelter; that they must be Europeans, and persons of birth by their beauty, delicate hands. Shape and complexions. He said thus in French to Clementina, ‘ In the name of God what are you, and ‘ from whence came you } Speak, if ^ you understand me, tell me if you ^ are in distress, that Imayhelp youd We are by birth Europeans,, and 5‘ profess the Christian faith, said She, as, I doubt not you do, since you Speak my native language; we are fled from ruin, infamy and stavery, and got into this dismal place to

ikulls, which this poor hermit had

And now desiring his guests to sit down, lighting his lamp, he pull’d a Small bottle of arrack out of his pocket, desiring them to drink, which they did. The lamp burning clear they could with p reat Satisfaction view each other,

Mariana was so furpriz’d. She could not utter one word; but Clementina pour’d some of the arrack into his mouth, which foon revived him; the most pastionate discourse pasted between him and Mariana that can be imagined: for what joy could exceed hers to meet her dear husband again? She begm to know how he came to live in that place; and all that had pasted since they were parted, which he related in these words, kisting her hands, and gazing upon her all the while, as if his glad soul, which Seemed to sparkle in his eager eyes,
would feast itself on that delightful object.

fom, he would let me go. Then I told him that there was a young gentlewoman who was taken with me in the Same Ship, and that if he could get me intelligence where She was, and find on what terms She might be freed, then I would send to Spain to my friends for a ransom for both, though they were but in mean circumstances; for I dar’d say no other, because the villain would have been extravagant in his demands; and I told him unless he could do this, I did not think it worth my while to write, or care what became of me. This vex’d him horribly. In Short, I lay ill So long, that had not his daughter, a handsome jewish maid, privately supply’d me with Some rich wines and good food, I had surely dy’d : for though a kind of a doctor he employed, gave me some medicines that conquer d my disease, yet I had never recovered strength enough to get away without her help; but being able to walk about, and little notice being

Thi? jew’s country house was fifteen miles off it, and I was two days and nighu a crawling to this minous place, intc which I entered, to rest myself, being quite spent. I had a bottle o’ wine, and Some bread and meat ty’c up in a cloth in this little basket, ir which I us’d to gather fruit for the table. After I hast eat and stepped here I began to confider what to do; if i enter’d the city, I Should run the risl< of being taken up perhaps and examined, and So be Sent to prison for i runaway, or Sent back to my master

I could hardly recol lect my Spirits, I was So moved at this dreadful sight. He fixed his eyes upon me, and seemed desirous to speak to me.

Said he, your curiosity is great to know who I am, and the strange adventures that have brought me to this dismal place and end; and I will endeavour to reward your kindness, if I am able, with the story of my life; I was the eldest Son of a noble family in Spain, it was my fortune to fall in love with a young lady, the daughter of a Grandee r I got her father’s permistion to court her, but was received but coldly; in fine, I found I had Some rival who Supplanted me in her affection, and made it my whole study to discover who he was; and it was not long e’er I was satisfy’d that a young Cavalier used to be admitted through the gardens fre quenttyj in the dead time of the

night, to her apartment. I passionately loved her, and this discovery So enraged me, that I resoived to kill him. In short, I lay in ambush with three of my Servants, in a grove behind the gardens, and Saw him enter, leaving his horse and one Servant to wait his coming out, which wtts not till the break of day. I advanced at the head of my Servants, and Shot him dead, and made off immediately without discovery, being mask’d; my coach waited about two miles off the place; So I quitted my horse, and went into it, reaching my own home in the city before it was broad day : by noon the news was Spread all over the city that Don Ferdinand de Juan my coufin german was kill’d, but none could discover by whom. I concealed my thoughts, appearing much concerned for his death, and being unable to live at quiet without Ravina, I pressed for our marriage So earnestly, that her father consented, and vie were joined

by the Sacred rites, not to be happy
but wretched; for She was So sincere
% ^
her affection to her murder’d lover, that She. could never be happy with another; and having too well convinced myself the first night, that my bride was no virgin, I grew furiousty jealous and unkind to her. This usage put her upon measures to be revenged; and her charms Soon procured me Such a rival, that I knew not how to cope withal; a duke made me that modish thing a cuckold, and to prevent my having any opportunity of being revenged, not only came always well attended to my house, but procured me a great post in the army, which obliged me to be absent from home most part of the year; yet niy wife lost no time but cursed me with a child every year. So that I began to look on her as a vile strumpet, and the children as vipers and serpents produced by her lust and my dishonour. At last 1
plotted the destruction of her and
them;

them, and having contrived this villainy to destroy them, and ruin my own peace and Soul, laid all things ready to escape from justice, I came home, and at one fatal supper in my wife’s apartment, poisoned her and her three children. At midnight I took horse, and reached the next, fearport by daybreak, where a bark lay which I had hired to carry me to England, having remitted a vast sum of money thither in order to provide for me there, knowing I must never return to Spain again. I went on board, met with a great storm which drove us towards the straits, where an Algerine pirate met with and took us; being brought to Tunis, I was sold for a stave to a Basta, who kept. me in extreme misery seven years; he being kill’d in the wars, I fell into the hands of his fon, who was an officer of the guard to the King of Fez and Morocco; with him I travelled many thousand leagues, carrying burdens, and running by his horfe’s fide.

All this I looked upon as a just punishment inflicted upon me by divine ' justice for my enormous sins, and
must confess the horrors of that guilt that loads my soul, were always more grievous to me than the bodily pains I Suffered, though they were almost insupportable. At last, quite wearied out and desperate, I fled over the mountains, and after wandering about in the disguise of a poor dervife, which ■ is the habit I have on, by means of
which I pafted undiscovered to this place, in which I chose to reside, and have lived five whole years unmolested, I got my bread by begging in‘ ". the adjacent city and Suburbs, being
held in great veneration by the common people, by reason of my dress ^ made me pafs for a religious
mahometan. All this time I have been labouring to make my peace with God by prayers and tears, hoping to wasti away my stains, and purify my conscience;; I hope, through the merits of my Saviour. I have’;. done:

‘done; It is about ten days since, coming to my dismal cell, I Saw two persons struggling as if one was going to rob or kill the other, and step >ping in between them, one of them, which I siippose to be the thief, stab’d me into the thigh with a poisoned icnise, as I since conclude, and then fled; the person I had rescued. Seemed very thankful, and desirous to know who I was, to reward me; but I was Shy of that. So he gave me a purse of gold and left me. I hasted home to dress my wound with Some Salve I
had by me, but the next morning I could not rise; I have lain here ever Since in extreme torment, have had no food these three days past, and believe my thigh is mortified. He related all this, often faltering in his Speech, and groaning, nay fainting Several times; but I Spare to make particular mention of these things. He concluded thus: And now, Said he, I Shall die by a violent death as those I murdered did; may God ac

cept of these my Sufferings and Repentance here, in compensation of the ills I have done, and then I Shall be happy. I kept him alive with the wine that night, but the mortification ended his unhappy life the next morning. I drag’d nis body into the next room, and Shut up the door as close as I could, to avoid the stench of it, and concluded to live here, putting on his old coat as a sure disguise: : took the purse of gold also, which was a great help to me, and having dy’d my face and hands with the juice of an herb to make me look thus tawny, have lived undiscovered all this time. I learned at my jew master’s to make straw hats, and baskets for to gather fruit in; these I make here in the heat of the day and sell for bread and meat, which if I get none ready drefs’d I broil upon Some coals, making a fire of sticks in the mosque, in one corner of which I have made myself a kind of fireplace with stones; then I bring down Some of the hot coals upon
Miss Harriot Montaohe. -27
on a tile into this place to warm and dry it, else I Should die with the dampness of it. I am So well acquainted with the country now, that I am confident I could find out Some more commodious place to live in: but fearing to go farther off the city, and be less likely to hear news of you, made me continue here; but since providence has been so merciful to bring you hither, you Shall take up with this being Some few days, till I can procure Such a difguise for each of you as I have on, and colour your faces like mine, which will wash off again; and then I will provide Some better place near the seaside for us to dwell in, till God is pleased to send some Ship to carry us off from this place. The rich vests and turbants you have on would Surely betray us; we will take the jewels off, and hide them in the vault among the dead bones, where none will seek them, and tomorrow I will buy two coats, and boots, with flannel to make you
C 2 long
2s
long tunicks to your heels, to keep you warm, and hide your fine linen underneath; your heads Shall be covered with flannel hoods, like cowls, with straw hats. This resolved on, they Sat down, and eat thankfully of the Scraps he had brought home. Thus with a good conscience, men may live contented, nay be even happy in the most miserable circumstances. A charnel house now entertains these two ladies, who are better pleased to eat Scraps, and lie on straw and the cold stones, than dwell in a fine palace, and steep on beds of down with infamy. After this poor repast, they prayed, and laid them'down to rest, mariana’s husband having fastened the door of the vault within fide as he used to do, to prevent wild beasts from entering there. The next morning he went to the city, and bought what they wanted, yet not at one place, but at several, for fear of suspicion, and returned soon;; they sat down to work,
and
 9
and made the flannel tunicks and hoods, as he diredied them; he had brought meat, and dressed it in the mosque above, whilst they worked in the vault below: by night they had
finished their disguises; and he, impatient to remove them from that dismal place, went out after they had dined, and searching along the Shore, found an old ruinous cottage on the fide of a rock, so built in the cleft of the rock, that it was well screened from the bleak winds or parching fun, and so Shadowed with trees that grew round about and over it, that it was not easily seen. No body lived in this place but an old fisherman and his wife. Don Alonzo told them he was a poor dervife whose cottage was tumbled down, and if they would quit this for him and two more hermits to live in, he would pay them to their content; the poor devout peasants, reverencing his sacred person and profefldon, gladly consented: : he paid them a Small matter,
C 3, though

though to them it was a great shirr,, and they quitted the place, retiring to another cottage at a little distance rom it; these poor people he employed to buy two quilts. Some coverlids, and what elfe was wanting, to make this place a convenient cell for
^ him and his two friends; and in three
days time, all being ready, they removed in the dusk of the evening from their distnal vault to this clean
wholeshme cottage, where they lived
for some monthsvery happily/hs
their rich jewels and clothes in a hole m the rock : the poor fisherman and his wife were very serviceable to them,, fetching what they wanted, and supplying them with fish; and having a good strong boat, they hoped by his means to get to some ship, he havshg promised to go on board the first European ship he could get sight of at
sea, for which service Don Alonzo ashired him, he would give them ten pieces of gold. During the time of nr female hermits abode in this place,
they
/
 1
they never went into the town; but Don Alonzo neglected not to go frequently to sell his straw baskets and, hats, which the ladies learned to make with great dexterity; so that they made enough to supply them with bread and meat in way of exchange. And now he thought it would not be improper to convert some of the jewels into ready money, which might stand them in stead, in cafe they found cause to remove or means to get off. In order to this, he carry’d some of the jewels Clementina had brought away in the fine box she took out of the bey’s wardrobe, which they had broke open, and found to be full of jewels and gold; a few of these he went with to a jew merchant in the city, whom he told that he had found a box with these jewels, and Some other things of value in it, on the Lands, as he was walking on the Seashore, and supposed to be part of some Shipwreck: the Jew did not
much trouble him with questions, but
C 4 finding

finding he Should have them a good pennyworth, cared not how he came by them, and bid him a thousand pieces of gold, but Don Alonzo insisted upon two thousand, to which the Jew at last agreed, and paid him down the money, the jewels being no doubt worth twice as much; but this Sum was Sufficient for our hermits. And now Don Alonzo could boldly go to him, and buy what they wanted, without fearing to give occasion of fulpicion,, stnce the Jew would not wonder how he came by money. All the diversion the hermits took, was to walk on the seashore in the evenings and early in the mornings, in hopes to discover fbme ship to get off. One morning, a dreadful storm having blown in the night, they went out to see what mischief was: done; and Clementina b .ing foremost, perceived Something floating on the sea;; stood still to observe it, and Soon Saw it was a man, with his hands fast clenched on a chest, his.

habit was lac’d with stiver : She cry’d out to Don Alonzo to come to help this poor wretch: he ran, and stepping up to his middle in the water,
'caught hold of the chest and drag’d it to shore. Then they took the man up, who appeared to be dead, but Don Alonzo holding him up by the heels, the water poured out of his mouth in great quantity, after which Some stgns of life appeared; they carried him homt^ to their cottage, gave him rack, and put him into a: warm bed, and So brought him to life; he was, a very handsome gentleman, and his linen and clothes Spoke him a man of no mean quality. Don Alonzo left him with the Ladies,, whilst he called the stfherman to help bring the chest to the cottage, fup postng it to contain something worth Saving. The stranger viewed the ladies with wonder, their strange habits and tawny complexions ill agreeing with the sweetness of their features,, and delicate hands and limbs : he

thought he knew one of them, yet was in doubt. Mean time they were very busy in tending him, giving him. burnt wine, and talking in French to one another, a language he was no flrangcr to, for he was a French gentleman by birth. At last he addrested himfelfto Clementina in this manner: Madam, if my eyes do not deceive ‘ me I have the honour to know you, is not your name Clementina? the unfortunate daughter of a mother ‘ who barbarousty Sent you out of France. Speak, are you a stranger * to Monsieur Le Montague ?’ At this discourse She changed colour, and. shedding some tears, reply’d, ‘ L am ‘ indeed the unfortunate Clementina,
'and too well know that name, since ‘ I am never like to see, or if I did,.
‘ can never postefs what I so dearly ' loved.’ ‘‘ Yes, Said he, you will I doubt not do both, for he is Safely arrived in France, and a widower, having fouglit for you all over Canada
and the West-indies; he came
^ home
ivlllsnakklut iviuimtacjujb:. 35
home a little before I left France.” Here he told her all the story of her mother’s death, and the manner of their living together; that he was now postested of a vast estate, and retired from the world on her account. By this time Don Alonzo and the fistier man brought in the chest, and Clementina proceeded to ask the stranger who he was, not being still able to recollect. He told her immediately that his name was Montelion. Good, heavens! said She, are you that charming gay young captain who used to visit and court my dear friend madam Cleora, when we were pensioners in the monastery together Yes, said he, I am that unfortunate man, who have married and brought that lovely maid from France to lose her life I fear, and it had been well for me to have perished with her; if She is dead, life will be a hell to me. I beg you therefore to add to the charitable office you have done in Saving me, by Searching
all tyre coast hereabouts carefully, for
She

she was holding fast on the chest, when my fenses forsook me, and then we were not far from the stiore :
hope therefore that She may still be
alive; if I do not find her, grief will
perhaps finish that life that you have

T Saw a boat noar us when I fainted; and conclude if She had been drowned, She would have kept her hold on. the chest, as’ people generally do; for this reason I flatter myself the fifher boat took her up, and neglected me, whom they might conclude dead or' that' Some wave might drive me out of their reach. Don Alonzo sent the old fisherman to make inquiry, who was acquainted with all the others on that coast, the stranger being fb weak he could not' rise. They entreated him to tell them his adventures, and the manner of his coming to that’coast;
which he related in these words. After you fair Clementina Ibft France, I confined my addrestes to

after you were gone, went away for Virginia, being highly disgusted with his guardians, resolving to apply himself to an uncle he has there, wha had cofiderable effects of his in his hands, he persuaded himself would assist him against his other unclesr Camilla followed him, no I news of them has come to France since they left it. Cleora was Soon removed' from St. Malos to Calais, and I following, She was Sent to the convent' of Auo; ustine nuns at Paris. Mean
o
time my elder brother dying, I became master of a fortune sufficient to answer hers : foi applied myself not only to her obdurate uncles, but to the bishop and principal merchants who importuned them to consent to our marriage, but to no purpose, for they were resolved never to part with her and her fortune, tho’ I proceeded So far, that I offered to divide it with them, btit this they rejected with a pretended Scorn. In stne, I Saw all I dki. was to no purpose, So I refolved’
to steal her away, and sty to Virginia to her brother, who being now come of age, might greatly astist me, as I will him. I Set out for Paris with this destgn, but was strangely disappointed when I came there, for She was removed thence to a house of her guardians (an old stone building, strong as a little fort) in a village in p Normandy. Here they placed her
under a kind of guard, for they put an old hag in the chamber with her, who never let her stir out but on the leads (for it was the uppermost room in the house)) stout Surly fellows lived below, and took care of the gate. ^ I took a private lodging in this village, disguised like a mean person, leaving my Servants at a market town three miles off; and pretended to the old farmer where I lodged, that I had been stck, and was come to that place for my health, being a tradesman at Coutance; this pasted very well with the country people.
The house.... dear Cleora was kept

I walked round it Several days to confider what eourse to take, and there I had the pleasure or rather torment, of feeing my dear Cleora walking with the old hag upon th e leads. I did not dare to make any. sign to discover myself to her, and being convinced that it was impossible to get at her by fair means, I resolved to life force; in order to which, I Sent the old farmer’s man to the market town, with a letter to my valet de chamber, whom I had left with two footmen and four horses, to come to me next morning, which they accordingly did. I took them to a place in sight of the prison where my mifirefs was, and we staid concealed under

lay concealed for above a month, in which time the Search made aster us was over, and they concluded we were gome out of the kingdom. Then having disguifed her in man’s clothes, and a Ship and money, with bills of exchange, being got ready for us at Diepe, we Set out from the curate’s, attended by two Servants, and got Safe off.
We then thought ourselves happy, and had a prosperous voyage, till we came through the Straits, when a dreadful storm arose, driving us on this coast; and our ship (which was but Small) striking upon a rock, bulged; we had no way to Save ourselves but by getting into the longboat: my dear wife was my chief care, I got her one of the first in, and the captain and Several Sailors and pastengers leapt after in Such disorder (all being willing to Save their lives) that they overset the boat, and we were all thrown into the merciless Sea.

The hermits did all they could to comfort him, and procured a habit like theirs for him : They resolved to be gone the first opportunity, but he could shot be persuaded to leave the place without his lady; nay, his impatience was Such, that he often ventured out in a morning early, and would go many miles along the seashore, making inquiry of the fishermen: but alas! he was deceived in looking for her there, for ^ She was otherwise dispofed of. Some months pasted in this manner, so that he began to despair of finding her, or they of getting thence; but providence, whose ways are unsearchable, and always tend to our good, detained them there for the preservation of the virtuous Cleora.

The ladies got her into bed, and gave her hot fpoon meat; but when they came to look upon her leg, they Ihrunk back amazed, for Ihe had

At last Don Alonzo went to the Jew, and told him he had occasion for a Surgeon, and desired his asststance. He told him, a friend of his had bought a Christian stave of that profefition, who had been Surgeon to a French Ship;
he would direct and recommend him
to that friend. He went with a letter from this Jew to the other, who freely lent him his stave 5 and they went

together, Don Alonzo talking with him by the way, found he was Surgeon to the Ship which brought Clementina from Canada. He acqu .inted
him with her being in his house, and his own story, not fearing to be discovered by a Christian, who he offered to redeem from stavery of the Jew; an offer the other gladly accepted of no question; for though we often live as ill as heathens, who profess ourselves Christians, and whilst we live together are often at variance; yet none but such as have experienced it, can tell the joy and comfort poor Christians find, in meeting and conversing together when in stavery amongst turks and heathens; then true charity glows in their breasts, and they gladly afifist one another to. the utmost of their power.
This surgeon was caressed by all, but especially by Clementina, who knew him to be a very honest gentleman. He drested the poor lady, and miraculousty restored her leg to
Such

Such a state, that in six weeks fly could walk with a crutch, though never able to go upright, but was ever lame, it being impofifible to cure it otherwise, having lain So long without help. Clementina asked him what was become of the captain; he told her he was dead, he believed of the wounds he received in the sight; a just reward for his crimes in using her as he had done. Now Gleora
being pretty well recovered, acquainted them how She came into this condition, and the occasion of her flying to the wood where Don Alonzo found her.
Being pulled into the boat (Said She) by means of the rope they threw out to me, I expected them (having Shown So much charity to me) to have made after you (addresting herself to her husband) but they Seemed deaf to my entreaties, neither did they under stand me, I beleive, because they were strangers to my language.

Were going, it being a fishing boat belonging to a Bashaw who lives there and Sent them out the day before to get fish for his table, as his custom was. They certainly imagined they had got a prize in me, feeing me young and tolerably handsome. When they had brought me to Shore, they led me directly to the bashaw’s (their masters) house, where I was delivered to a black, who Seemed mighty glad, and viewed me So curiousty, that my face was overspread with blushes. By him I was led to a fine Apartment, where an old maid servant, who spoke French, came to me; the grief and Surprise I was unden made me glad to meet with Somebody to inform me what I was to be done with : I asked her many questions, and was answered, that I Was to be mistress to one of the handsomest and most powerful men in the place, that he was his princes chief favourite; in Short, She praised him up to the shies. I told her I was already married, and vol. II D would

so long without Seeing this tyrannical Ateerine; but' at last I learned the ■ reason, she was lick of astertian ague and fever all that time; as Soon as she recovered he ordered me to be brought to him, to his country house, having had Such an advantageous cha, racter given him of me, that he was impatient to see me. I had contracted a kind of friendship with a young creature, who had been brought there at ten years old; her name was Emilia, an English gentleman’s daughter of great fortune; She was goddaughter to a lady, whose husband was a rich Merchant, and went to settle in the West-indies with his family, She took this beautiful girl along with her, and the Ship being unfortunately taken, and brought into Tunis, She was sold to this bashaw, whose mistress She had been five years when I came to that unhappy place. She was fair as an angel, witty, and highly sensible of her misfortune

daughter, which was carried away from her Soon after it was born. She pity’d me extremely, and afisured me that it was almost impostible to escape thence. She Seemed resigned to her misfortunes, and said, since God has been pleased to Suffer her to be reduced to such a way of life, where She could have no opportunity of pradfifing her religion, or avoiding the infidel’s embraces, stie hoped he would not lay anything to her charge as a crime, since it was compulsion, not choice. But all her arguments Seemed weak to me, and I resolved on death rather than to yield. At last, one morning the old French woman entered my chamber, and bid me prepare myself to go to the great man, whose favourite I was to be. She brought me a rich habit and linen, and drested me to all the advantao*e such a pagan habit could be put on

So that it was in vain to restsh I was about three hours upon the road, and had resused to eat anything before I Set out, that I was So faint when they came to take me out, that two of them were fain to lead me into the house, which was a kind of earthly paradise, adorned with fine paintings, and such furniture, that I Was surprised. Being condutsted to a delicate chamber, where there was a bed made after the European fashion, and velvet stools and chairs, things very uncom inon in these parts of the world; they left me, and in a few morients after a gentleman, in a rich nightgown and turban, entered : he was tall, stender, and delicately Shaped, his eyes were black and Shining, his skin moderately fair, his air and mein so Soft and engaging, that I stood con

At these words Montelioti reddened; She perceiving it, with a smile Said, my dear don’t be jealous, for his beauty and my persuasions did him no further Service with me, but to raifemy pity; for I Soon perceived he was an European, and had bought his greatness here by renouncing his faith. He bowed, and flood looking upon me for Some time without fpeak ino*; then, like a man awakened

from a pleasant dream to Substantial joy, he catched me in his arms, and said in French, ‘ same has done you ‘ wrong, sweet creature; you are ‘ fairer than fancy could conceive; ‘ take to your arms a man that adores ‘ you, and knows how to value Such ‘ a treasure; no Barbarian or fierce ‘ Moor, but one who was born in the ‘ politest part of the world: I am an ‘ Italian, whom injuries drove hither; ‘ who being ruined by my fellow. ‘ Christians, have fled for Succour to ‘ barbarians, who have advanced ‘ and made me great enough to make

persuasions postible to gain me, nay, stooped to beg and pray; but finding me inflexible, and growing faint, be ing still weak with his.lateillness, he called for wine, Iherbet, and Sweetmeats, courting me to eat and drink, but I refused. Then he asked me if I designed to be my own murderer, and damn myself? I answered no, but I did not think it Safe to eat and drink with a person who had base designs upon my virtue, and might, perhaps, deprive me of my reason by Some stupifying drug, and ruin me :

therefore I would abstain from eating till providence supplied me with Some wholesome bread and water, or anything that might Satisfy hunger without danger. He Seemed surprised at my being so refolutcj and no doubt but his conscience pricked him when lie Saw me So well perform my duty, which he had by cowardice and ambition acted contrary to. At last he took leave, bidding me reflect, that no human power could free me from him; that I must at last yield to his desires; that he would much rather gain me by courtship, than force; but if I continued obstinate, he must be obliged to constrain me to be kind; then he left me, a stave keeping the door. This civility, I believe, was owing to his weakness;; being now left alone, I sat down in a chair, and fell into a Serious consideration of my wretched condition: I had no weapon to defend myself, or harm him; the doors were guarded; then I viewed the windows, and they were
so
 7
So high, that a leap from thence Seemed to threaten certain death; 1 disputed in my conscience the lawfulness of such an action. Thus I sat till evening, being often interrupted by his officious staves, who brought me choice wines and presents from him, all which I refused;; at last fearing want of fustenance would render me unable to resist him if he offered force, or faintness seize my Spirits, and deprive me of my reason, I made the stave that brought in the wine, drink a glass of it before me, and then I took two glastes full myself, and eat Some bread. When it grew dark they urged me to go to bed, but I refused. They brought in two wax lights, and retired. Shutting the door; and now I trembled, fearing what followed. About midnight the apostate Bashaw entered the chain ber, and fastening the door, came to me, using all the Softest persuasions and entreaties : in ffiort, finding me

At last he swooned at my feet, and then being distracted with my fears, I resolved to life those happy moments; so without standing to deliberate, I catched the rich fash off that ty’d his nightgown, and fastening one end to one of the bars of the windows, stid down; but that not being above three yards long, I fell down from a great height, and lay for sometime quite stun’d; but recovering, found I had not broke my bones, and rising on my feet, fled towards the next wood, it being a very moonlight night: I thought it riot sofar off as it proved, for it was near two miles, as I guess, and I had hardly strength left to reach it, but fear drove me on When I entered the wood I was filled with more dreadful apprehensions, and fancied the wild beasts would devour me; to avoid which I got up into a tree,
whose
 9
whose trunk being old and hollow, I easily climbed : There I Seated myseis and palted the remainder of the night till daybreak?? then I feared to descend, lest I Should be pursued; nor did I know where to go. Whilst, I was thus musing Sleep prevailed over thought, and I fell into a dumber, and drop’d down from the tree, which fall broke my leg. What I endured for three days that I lay there, you may imagine: I expectednothingbi.it death, as ^ I had reason to do; but providence preserved and relieved me by your means, for which I will be thankful whilst I live.
All the company joined in praises to God, and were filled with admiration: : pasted the time very a greeably, till the good old fisherman, • whom they had converted to the christian faith, together with his wife, acquainted them, that he had that morning met at Sea with a Spanisti Ship, had been aboard it, and informed the
captain of their being there; that he
had
6o
had promised to Send his longboat that night to a creek behind the rock to fetch them. It is. Said he, a fiiip of good force, and fears no pirate, being well armm and mann’d. Don Alonzo, on this news, went away to Tunis, and gave his friend the Surgeon notice, who went back with him. The ladies in the mean time packed up their jewels, money, and Some linen, and all being ready, they went away to the creek in the dusk, and waited the boat’s coming. They offered to take the fisherman and his wife along with them, but they chose to end their lives in their own country, pleading their age : So they left them all their furniture, and twenty pieces of gold, a fufiicient provision Tor them. The ship’s boat came about eleven o’clock at night, and carried them off Safely to the Ship, Don Alonzo promising to assist Clementina and the surgeon to return to. France by land, and he and Mariana
doubted not of a good reception from
his
%
 i
his friends at Madrid., Besides, the two ladies had brought Such a treasure in jewels from the bey’s seraglio, that that being divided was sufficient to provide for them all. Montelion and his lady were presented with a part of them, and his chest having been saved, was a provision for them, they were prevailed upon to desist from their intended voyage to Virginia, Clementina promising, that Monsieur le Montague Should stand by them against her unjust guardians, so they determined to go home to France with her. The Spanish captain received them with transport, and they had leisure to entertain him with an account of all their strange adventures.
They arrived at Barcelona in good health, sold part of their jewels there, highly rewarded the captain, and Don alonzo’s friends provided nobly for him and Mariana, who writ to her parents at Venice an account of all her fnfferings, and safe return to
Europe. The S'rench ladies and gentlemen
6a
tlemen stayed Some days to recover themselves of the fatigue of their voyage, and then fet out for France, promising never to forget the civilities they had received, and the friendship they had all contracted with one another in their misery. And now his fit that we leave the barbarous Algerines, and return to Leander and his kinsman, whom we left travelling to Virginia through Carolina.
Leander and his generous kinsman with the hermit Mofieur de Liste, came safe to Virginia, where they were gladly receivedshy the old gentleman and his newt wife. Leander was much pleased that she was now his aunt, and young Dumarefque liked her well enough for a mother in law; yet she could not look upon her nephew without blushes and Some kind of disorder; this was observed by her husband, and he began to wish his kinsman thence. He well knew that She married him in a pique, not out of affection. In Short, having been in
formxd
 ^
formed of all that had befallen him and his fen in their voyage to the island of St. Domingo, he calmly advised him to return to France, having honourably accounted with him for all the moneys and effedfs left in his hands, and made him a handsome present of sugars, tobacco, and other commodities which that country produces, to a great value; saying, ‘ Nephew I al ‘ ways designed you Something, and ‘ though I have now a profpedi; of ‘ more children, yet I will do what ‘ I Intended; you are now of age, ‘ and your guardians can no longer ® detain you from your own, it is time

irnr

for his good advice and present, bui was determined not to follow his counsel, though Monsieur de Lisle preflec him extremely to go with him tc France, but Leander would not consent to leave Harriot behind. Younc Dumarefque likewise Spurred him or to let him go back to the ifiand to in choir after her; but alas! he hac another design than that only in view he had Seen the charming Lavinia Don carlos’s sister, and her brigh image So filled his Soul, that he coule not rest. We easily consent to wha we desire. Leander deals with th( captain that carried them thither b.c.' fore, to go back again with his kinsman. Mean time he finding his uncle look cold upon him, invited Mon sieur de Lisle, no Ship being at tha time ready to go for France, to gc with him to see another plantation o: his uncle’s and view the country The Ship goes off with dumaresque much against his father’s will; but he arrived Safe at the ifiand, and resolved
t€
 ^
to lie on board the ship every night and not taking a lodging on Shore, for Sear of discovery; in the day he ventured to walk about the town, and went to the great church to mass on the next Sunday after his arrival, there he Saw the charming Harriot, with her little Son and daughter standing by the governor her father-in-law, drested in a widow’s dress, and lavi nia in deep mourning. This was a very agreeable sight no doubt to him; he did not dare to venture to Speak to her, but was fain to wait for an opportunity Some other time, which he supposed would not be extreme difficult, now Don Carlos was no more; but he was mistaken, for he had engaged his father on his deathbed to prevent, if pofifible, her ever feeing Leander again. ‘ My dear lord and ‘ father. Said he, he is the cause of ‘ my death, he ruined my repose, ‘ and if he returns, will rob my dear ‘ children of their mother; her af
f Sections are still inclined to him. I
have
6  or
* have brought her to the catholic ‘ faith, he is a Hugonot, and will ‘ Seduce her from her religion and ‘ child! 'en; do not let my fortune ‘ Serve to enrich my hated rival, nor ‘ my children be wronged.’ He likewise charged Harriot, as She valued his foul’s repose, not to. marry him, or leave that istand and his children. Thus the revengeful Spaniard, even in death, continued to hate his brave rival, who had a prior right to her heart, and endeavoured to prevent his happiness, even when he could no longer enjoy her himself. For these reasons the governor, who was inconsolable for the loss of his fon, desired Harriot to live in the castle with him, where she was respected as a queen, and had all the reason in. the world to be contented. Lavinia, who was courted by the greatest persons in the istand, kept her company, and there was the greatest friendship imaginable between them. Lavinia had not as yet felt cupid’s Tyranny; -
She

She Seemed invincible to love. Young Dumarefque having waited Some days in vain for an opportunity to Speak to Harriot, grew weary, and resolved to give her a letter in publiek. He thought in hi^ielf. She is now a widow, and Sree to choose whom stie pleases; why Should I fear to remind her of her vows and engagements with my friend? He drefsed himself very fine the next festival day, and went to mass earlier than before, and there waited till they all came; then he went boldly up to Harriot, and with a profouild bow, presented the letter to her; this he did with Such a grace and mein, that Lavinia locking upon him, was Seized with Such an
unusual liking to him, and So disordered, that She could Scarce conceal it; love at this fatal moment entered her breast. He withdrew to the other fide of the altar So soon as he had delivered the letter, and there placed himself on his knees right against hem, with design to observe Har—

Meanwhile the governor observed him, and watched Harriot, who having looked on the superscription of the letter, guested that it brought news of Leander, and remembered young dumarefque’s face. This threw her into a mighty disorder; stie put the letter into her pocket, not daring to
peruse it in so public a place: but the distraction of her mind caused her in a few minutes to saint. This confirmed the governor in his suspicions, and he whispered one of his gentlemen, whom he beckoned to him, to take care that gentleman was Secured as he went out of the church, and kept mnder a guard till he examined him.

he gave Harriot his hand to lead her to the coach. So that She had lio opportunity to Speak to young duma resque. A young Cavalier, who courted Lavinia, did the Same by her, inflamed with jealousy at her behaviour towards the stranger, who imprudently Sollowed them, in hopes to Speak to one of the ladies; but he was Seized at the church door as they were going into the coach, he struggled, - and demanded a reason of the soldiers and gentlemen that laid hands upon him, but could get no other answer but that it was the governor’s order: So he was carried to the room in the castle, and kept till the governor, having conducted the ladies to their chamber, came and examined him, asking him what the letter contained that he had given his daughter in law, whence he came, and who Sent him: To all which he answered boldly, and told the truth, saying; ‘ My lord, 1 do not think that I ‘ have done anything but my duty.

Harriot, so soon as her father-in-law left her with Lavinia, opened the letter and read it aloud to her; stie could not conceal her joy to hear her dear Leander was alive and constant. Ah!

This news extremely alarmed them, and confirmed their fears; they employed Claudio, not daring to be too inqui sttive themselves, to get intelligence,

for she was mistress to Claudio the

governor’s gentleman, who had the charge of young Dumarefque; but he Setting out with him that night for the prison to see him Secured there, she could get no account of him till the next morning, when she got the Secret out of Claudio where he was. This news overwhelmed the ladies with grief, and Harriot grew so incensed, that She quarrelled with her father-in-law, complaining that Ihe was not treated as she ought to be, and if the gentleman was not freed, she would complain to the King of Spain, that she had been taken away from Leander by fraud, and compelled to marry Don Carlos; that she was a Subject of England, though his daughter in law; that he had no power to command or restrain her from going off the istand, and marrying whom She pleased. This So enraged the governor, that he told her, since he found that she had so little sense of her honour, and respect for heir hushand’s vol. II E memory

memory and her children’s good, of his dying commands, he. would take care to keep her to her duty, and prevent her disgrace; that Leander was of too mean a rank to be received in the place of that noble Spaniard his dear fon, who was descended from an illustrious family, and had demeaned himself in marrying her; he had hitherto treated her for his sake with too much indulgence, which he perceived She had no grateful sense of; that young Dumarefque though a good friend to Leander, yet was a venturous fool to return thither on So vile an errand, as to bring love letters to another man’s wise, that he began to doubt whether his fon had died fairly, or not, and to suspect She had ^ by Some cur fed stow poison destroyed
him, elfe they could not have known the time when it was fit to come to her, and knew She was a widow: in Short, he loaded her with bitter reproaches and taunts, and confined her

The governor little fuspected his daughter was any ways concerned in young durnarefqiie’s welfare; but alas, She was as much afflicted as Harriot, and ventured to' send Clara with a purse of gold to him. He would have sent a letter back but was denied pen, ink and paper. Clara lent him her table book, in which he wrote a most past lionate letter to Lavinia, declaring his love, and begging her to let the captain who brought him thither, be informed of what had happened to him, and sent back to Leander to warn him not to come thither. On the receipt of this letter, Lavinia dispatched Clara to the captain, who presently weighed anchor, and fet sail for, Virginia, to carry these joyful and tidings to Leander first that Harriot was a

widow, and next that his kinsman was in prison, and stie under a guard on his account. Leander in a Short time was insormed of all, the Ship coming fase to Virginia; and no persuasion of his uncle, aunt and friends could detef him from going over to the island, to demand his lady, and release his friend : but the captain of the Ship refused to go back, saying he was sure he stiould be imprisoned and lose his Ship. It was some months before he could get a vessel to carry him; during which the governor was informed by his spies of clara’s visits to young Dumareftjue in the prison. He caused him to be secretly removed to the old castle where he had been before a prisoner;; the commanding officer had such a strict charge given him to take care of him, that he was Secured from any possibility of an ef*

four hours. The haughty governor having thus Secured him, laid wait to catch Leander, not doubting but he would Soon Sollow his friend, when he heard the news from the Virginia captain, of whose departure out of the port he had had intelligence and would have stopped the fhlp, which he had a good pretence for, it being a time of war between the English, French and Spaniards; but only he concluded it best to let it go to fetch Leander.
Harriot fell stck, and Lavinia grew very melancholy and much altered; no news could be got of young du maresque. At length stie fell dange rousty ill, insomuch that her life was in danger, and being light headed, called perpetually on her lover. This opened the governor’s eyes, who finding She loved this stranger, lost all patience. She was now his only child, and all his ambitious hopes were coinprehended in her being nobly disposed of. The noblest and wealthiest gentlemen in the place made their addrestes to her,

and would have been proud of having her: but She was attached to a man whose father was only a merchant, married to a Second wife, by whom he had younger children to jenen his fortune; besides he was a protestant, and that alone was enough to make him reject the match; in fine, he was at his wits end; the physicians told him medicines could do no good, he must resign her to death, or bring the person to her whom She loved. This expedient was death to him, yet he could not consent to lose his darling, the lovely Lavinia; at last he Sent for young Dumarefque, who was brought pinioned under a guard like a criminal, and expected nothing but death; he had been sick a considerable time f an ague and fever, which was turned to a yellow jaundice. So that he was So altered, that his friends would Scarce have known him. Being brought tp the castle, and carried up into a room, the governor came to him with looks that exprested the inward distraction

of his mind. Stranger, Said He, what would you do to gaiit .your freedom? nothing, he replied fiercely, that Should be injurious to my honour or conscience: I am now indifferent to. life, and would not thank Shat man who, having injured me. Should ask me pardon and release me; you may use me as you please, you have treated me so ill already, that I expected neither justice nor favour from you. The governor could not but admire young dumarefque’s bravery in Secret, but yet Seemed angry; and answered, sir, do you confider whom you Speak to, and that your life is at my disposal?? I do, sir. Said dumaresque, and. have Spoke my thoughts. Well sir, said the governor, I acknowledge I have used you Somewhat roughly; but had you lost Such a Son as I have, killed by your friend’s rash attempt, 'which has broke my fon’s heart and Harriot's peace, you would doubtless have acted like me; but I have nowbut one daughter (here he wiped off the falling tears

do you respect her? young duma resque alarmed at these words, answered hastily, yes, and honour her above the world, nay dare to tell you that I love her, and that it is my greatest ambition to die at her feet, if fate would permit me; nor is there a thing on earth for which I would wish to live beside herself. For her sake answered the governor, you Shall not only live, but be freed. At these words he took him by the hand, and calling in a servant, who unbound him, he led him to lavinia’s chamber, who was so weak that she had been many days confined to her bed. Here my dear child, said the governor, is the gentleman you so much respect;; Shall leave you together. He was So disordered, being forced to stifle his resentments and constrain his pride, that he immediately withdrew. Lavinia lifting up her eyes, viewed young Dumarefque with much concern, unable to Speak, his altered face too well informed her of the treat ^ment he had met withal j whilst he

feeing her, whom he So dearly prized, in a condition So unlikely to recover, fetched a deep sigh, and falling on his knees by the bed, catched her hand, and raising it to his lips. Said with a low voice, ‘ Must we then meet to part ‘ So Soon again, and must death de ‘ prive us of that happiness we might * now postess? Speak, divine creature, ‘ what hopes? “If, Said She, there is “a cordial to restore me to my health again, it is the sight of you, a bless“ “I despaired of. Say, does my “cruel fither relent, will he consent“ “make us happy? and has he granted you your liberty If So, I “will endeavour to live, ” At these words, he fell into a great transport;; the governor entering, said a great many obliging things to him. In fine, Lavinia in a Short time recovered, and was married to dumaresque, on his promising to reside there, and not return to Virginia to live. But poor Harriot, though glad of her lister’s good fortune, and pleased to converse with

s
dumaresque, of whom stie learned all that had befallen the unfortunate Leander, yet could get no Satisfaction, or find means to go to him, the governor having took Such measures that no person could enter or go out of the Seaports without his knowledge. duma refquc could not as yet propose going to Virginia, but supposed his friend would Shortly arrive, and that his dear lavinia^s interest and his, with his father-in-law, was Sufficient to procure his content to the unfortunate leander’s marriage with Harriot. Thus they stattered themselves;; a Spaniard's revenge must be gratified; and they never, or very rarely forgive an injury. Leander having procured a Vestel to carry him, and taking a considerable sum of money from his uncle. Set sail from Virginia, and arrived at the island of St. Domingo about a month after his kinfman'^s marriage. He no Sooner fet his foot upon the Shore, filled with expectations of teeing his dear Harriot but he was Seized
by

by ruffians, bound band and foot, and carried aboard another strip, where he was put in irons, and Sailed the next morning, he knew not whither. The same night that he was Seized, the captain of the Ship that brought him, received a mestage from the governor to depart the island that moment, or expect to be treated as an enemy, and his Ship to be seized. He obeyed immediately, finding that neither threats nor entreaties could avail him. This news never reached harriot’s ear; and poor Leander, overwhelmed with dest pair, was carried up the great river Oroonoko, and seton stiore amongst the savages, being carried in a boat up to the river Paria, where he expected nothing but to be murdered, and eaten by the barbarous Indians, who dwelled in huts, and are under no civil government. Theyfpeak no language, but a jargon that no European understands. The cruel Spaniards unbound him, gave him a sword, a gun, and a horn of powder, with a pouch full of
bullets

bullet and shot; telling him if he offered to make the least attempt to follow them, they would kill him on the spot. He little regarded what they Said, being bothxveak and over whelmed with the dreadful prospect he had before him of being left in a strange place, from whence there was no probability of escaping; a place which we Europeans are little acquainted withal amongst Savages, whose language and customs, he was an entire stranger to, that he sat down upon the ground, and casting his eyes round wept bitterly : then looking up to heaven, besought God to look upon him, and deliver him from the miseries of life. Whilst he was thus employed, the villains retreating to their boat were Set upon by a party of savages, about a hundred in number, many of whom fell by the spaniard’s shot, who discharged their guns and pistols at them, which obliged the Indians to give back. The Spaniards being but €%ht in number, and Some af them

The cruel Spaniards now too late repented the wicked deed they had done, and feeing death at hand, trembled at future punishments; despair urged them on, and they turned back and pursued their enemies, who fled before them to the place where poor Leander, roused with the noise of their guns and Swords, was standing as a man who was prepared for death, and unconcerned at whatever happened : but when they called to him to help them, crying forgive and join with us; Christianity, and the generosity of his great soul, made him forget the injuries they had done him; and like a lion roused from his den,

fall on the Savages till they had all left the place. Then thinking it iinsafe to pnrsue them further, he advised the Spaniards to retreat towards the river under the covert of Some rock; they consented, and hasted thither, there they found a great cavern in the fide of a rock, into which they entered with joy, and being quite Spent, and three of them dangerousty wounded, they sat down on the ground to rest, destitute of food or any necestaries. That night the three wounded men expired; a admonition to the rest, who were conscious they deserved no less. They were now Sincerely penitent, and consnlted with Leander, whom they resolved to obey in all things, what was best to be done; they knew they could not live without provision, and though they hoped the boat would return to fetch them, yet that being uncertain, they must find some means to Subfish At last they resolved to go out of this dismal place
before it was broad day, and if possible


lible Seize upon one of the huts of the Savages, and Secure them, and So keep them as hostages, sending one at a time to fetch food for them, and by stgns threaten to kill the rest if northeast failed to return. They charged their firearms, and crept along the Shore till they came to a hut, into which they entered, and found two Savages, a woman, three children, and an European man, as his complexion Showed, asteep; they Seized the Savages, but for the white man, who appeared to be of a great age, he arose and embraced them, crosting himself; and lifting up his hands as a man overjoy’d, he Spake to them in the Latin tongue, desiring to know who they were and whence they came.

The old man Spoke to the Indians in their tongue, and they immediately fell at the spaniard’s feet, killing them, and bowing down their heads in token of obedience. The old man told Leander that he had lived twenty years in that country; that he was a Benedictine monk, born at Valladolid in Spain, and thence Sent to Peru, from whence he had travelled to this place by land; that he had learned the language of these Savages, and living amongst them, gained their esteem, and converted many to christianity;; these poor Savages were some of them, with whom he chose to live, being very honest people; that he would undertake they Should Supply all their wants, and be very serviceable to them; that the Savages they had fought with were the enemies of the prince that governed that part of the country, and used frequently to invade him, and carry off feme of his people, whom they eat,

is his Subjects did them; but that now he had persuaded a great many from, doing it, and pretty well broke them of those barbarous customs. He then desired the Spaniards to sit down with him, and take some refreshment without fear. After which he Said he would conduct them to a place where they might live Securely, till he could find means to procure their return to theistand of St. Domingo or Virginia, offering to be their guide to cartha gena, from whence they iiiight get shipping to either place. Leander returned him a thousand acknowledgments, and in his soul greatly admired the providence of God, but wanted an opportunity to inform him of the spa nisti villainy in bringing him thither, and to warn him not to be too free in discovering any secret retreat to them, which he was desirous to conceal, though his countrymen; for though they appeared sincerely penitent, yet he feared to trust himself with them

refblving to go to Virginia, and not venture to go there any more; concluding in himself, that if harriot’s affection for hina continued sincere, She would, now being a widow, find means to get away and come to him thither; and that if at his return to Virginia, he could hear nothing of her nor his dear friend, he would apply to the spanish Vice roy at Mexico for justice; and being a native of France, he doubted not of obtaining it, stnce France and Spain were at peace. He and the rest sat down with the good monk; the poor Savages, who were by profestion fishermen, fet bread and cold drested fish before them, with Some meat and broth which they had boiled the day before for the humble priest and themselves;; they had warmed over a fire which they made in the hut with a few stones Set in form of a hearth, with a hole made in the ground, setting the pot on the stones,
and making a fire underneath: they
gave

gave them also drink and rum, which greatly refreshed them.
Leander whispered the monk that he wanted to Speak with him alone; he took the hint, and after eating, advised the spaniard’s to lie down on the clean straw which the poor Savages had laid for them in one corner of the hut, the only bed he and they had used to lie upon; there, Said he, " you may repose yonrfelves,. wshilfi your leader and I discourse. They readily complied glad to take some rest. Whilst he and Leander walked over the hill, they descended into a fine valley, at the bottom of which was a little kind of copse or thicket, composed of stately tall trees and close quickset hedges. By the way Leander told him his story; the monk detesting their baseness, told him he should return no more to them, but abide with those that he had placed in that little cell to which he was going to carry him : there you will find.

Velvet, her petticoat gold tiftue, bracelets of pearl; and in fine, I never Saw a person of greater beauty, or who appeared more like a woman of quality than the distressed Ravina, for that is her name; the man that lay at her feet as dead, appeared her equal in all kinds; he was young, handsome, richly dressed, and seemed just drowned. I staid not to deliberate, but list ted him up, saying in Spanish, which I supposed She spoke, God comfort and help you, sweet lady, has this gentleman been here in this condition any time? Oh no. Said She, he is just Cast upon the Shore. Then Said I, there is hopes; I immediately turned his head downwards, and a great deal of water poured out of his mouth, he strewed Some Signs of life. Having thus given his stomach Some relief by this discharge of water, I Set him upright on the ground, chafed his temples, and taking a little bottle of rack, which I always carried about me, poured Some down his throat; in fine,

But words cannot express Lean der's surprise at the first sight of thef strangers; he thought Ravina so beau tiful, that She excelled all her sex her air, her Shape, dress and face and the gloominess of the place fh' was in, filled him with an unufua veneration and refpe<5i for her. Bel lario was tall, finely shaped, and ha( a majestic sweetness in his look tha commanded the respect and gainet the love of all that Saw him. They Servant was a young Italian maid who though of an olive complexion

had eyes So black and Shining, that it was dangerous to look upon them. The monk used to Send them provisions by this girl, whose name was Philinda,. having been christened by Ravina who took her when a child, and had brought her up. Philinda went every morning to the hut to fetch Such poor food as the monk could procure for them; they drank water from an adjacent Spring, had Some poultry that they kept in the wood to Supply them with flesh and eggs, there being plenty of fowl in ■ those parts, as iikewife roots: the country being not very well peopled, they lay on straw; and there growing very good grapes in the valleys, they had hung some up to dry in the fun Upon the hedges, and Squeezing the juice out of others, drank of it instead of wine." Thus life great people, who had been used to all the delicacies in nature, and had never stepped but upon down, and used to have the finest clean linen every day, were now

content to live in the poorest manner, and Sound that it was postible to live without all those things that a plentiful Sortune surnishes. The monk having thus introduced Leander, and stayed Some time with them, took leave; and then Leander being in treated, entertained them with a more particular account of his life and adventures. After which Bellario returned the favour with the relation of his and Ravina, being Seated under a fine Spreading tree near the door of their cottage, it being now the close of the day, and a fine evening, phi linda being very near them milking two tame ihe goats which the monk had Sent thither, and were of great Service to them.
They being all Seated commanding on the lest fide a fine view of the river Oroonoko, which discharged itself into the Sea fronting them, and on the right, a fine range of cedar trees : in this delightful place Bellario began his relation in these words: I stiould first relate

my dear Ravinast birth, and Speak of her family. She was the only daughter of the marquis of Castille, who is descended of one of noblest families in Italy, though born a Spaniard: her mother was daughter of Don Lorenzo, lord of Placentia, a Castilian lord of great merit and fortune. The marquis being a great favourite to the king of Spain, was appointed vice roy of the Indies in the year 1692, at which time Ravina was thirteen years of age. He arrived Safely at Mexico the Same year with all his family, and has resided there ever since, which is now ten years, I am the Son of Don Alvares de Mendoza, an Arragonian lord, a man of equal birth and fortune with ra vina’s father; but there was a mortal hatred between our two families, by reasonof a fatal accident thathappened in my infancy: my father had a lister, who was esteemed one of the fairest and most accomplished young ladies in Spain; She was but fifteen when my
father brought her to court; there a
F 2 young

young Castilian cavalier, who was a colonel of the guards, and nephew tora vina’s father, saw and fell in love with my aunt, who was already promised to a lord of the first quality and fortune in Arragon : he courted her privately by means of a Servant, who was in his interest; and having gained my aunds affection, at length obtained the last favour. It was not long after this unhappy converse had been between them, before the lord to whom She was promised arrived, and She was constrained to marry him: he suspecting her virtue, being sensible She was no virgin, became furioufiy jealous; yet concealed his thoughts from her and all the world, resolving to stay till he had discovered the happy rival that had been beforehand with him, before he let his resentments break forth: for these reasons he gave her opportunities of feeing her lover, carrying her down to a country seat not far from Madrid, which he had Fought since his marriage, under pretence of obliging her, but indeed with
design
‘  ioi
design to discover the fatal Secret. Here he often left her for a night or ^vo, whilst he went and stayed at Madrid ' with the king; the unfortunate Don Lorenzo (her lover) failed not to Supply his place in her arms, going disguised to a peafant’s house at a village near, from whence (attended only by one Servant) he entered the gardens, and went into her apartment by a ladder of ropes, which She used to fasten for him on a balcony that opened into her chamber. Her lord (the incensed ar ragonian)foon discovered all by means of a page whom he had employed to watch; and one night he concealed himself in a fummer house in the garden, having only this page with him, both well armed; and the moon Shining very bright, saw Don Lorenzo go into her chamber by the ladder, which he left hanging in order to his retreat, as usual. He stayed till he supposed he was undrest and gone to bed; then he mounted the ladder, followed by his page, and coming into the chamber,
F 3 where

where a wax light was burning on the table, approached the bed Ibftly. Don Lorenzo havingheard Some little noiscj was started up, and Sat upright in the bed : This gave the enraged husband a fair opportunity for his revenge, he stabbed him to the heart with his dagger; the poor lady Shrieking out, he tore her out of bed by the hair, cut out her tongue, and discharging one of his pistols in her face, which he had loaded with small bird shot on purpose, left her on the bed blind, her eyes and face being in a most dreadful condition, all tore to pieces, and full of the stiot. Never was a more tragic Scene than this chamber appeared; She looked like the wronged Calistst, and the unfortunate Lorenzo lay weltering in his blood, expiring on the floor.
Thus one imprudent flnfui action Gceafioned the riin of three noble ac complistted pershns; nay, involved their families in the greatest misfortunes, and have intailed them upon their posterity; the first ground of

which was the ladies parents, who not consulting her inclination, matched her against her will; want of a firm virtue in her made her yield to another, when She was pre engaged by them * and an unchristian Spirit of revenge governed her husband, and made him commit two dreadful murders, and incur the anger of heaven, and the justice of the laws : which though he escaped by slight and his prince’s favour, yet it ruined his peace and fortune. I hope it will be a war^ ning to all who hear this dismal story, to avoid the like crimes. The dis tracted husband having thus difchar -- ged his fury, thought of his own Safety; and taking Some gold and his wife’s jewels out of a cabine, in that room, descended the ladder, and attended by his page, went out of another gate than that by which his rival had entered; and mounting his horse, which he had left therewith his page, they rode away as Swift as postible to a place twenty miles farther, where

he took flielter in a. convent of be nedidhne monks. Don lorenzo’s gentleman finding his master stayed longer than usual, grew nneasy, and quitting his horse ventured up the ladder, thinking he rnight be asleep; but entering the room, he was filled with Such horror and amazement, that he alarmed all the Servants with the outcries he made. The poor lady was not dead; She was such an objecst as would have excited compastion in the heart of a barbarian. It was easy to guess the cause of all these dreadful deeds, had the gentleman not revealed them by his lamentations over his dead lord; but he concealed nothing in his pastion, but too well explained the ladies crime and his master’s.

fortune to her than death, her confefibr was Sent for, who prayed for her, and gave her all the Spiritual comfort he was able; and though She could not speak, yet by signs She testified her repentance. He stayed with her many hours, till finding the anguish of her wounds and loss of blood took away her senses by a strong fever, he left her to the care of her Servants, and asiisted Don lorenzo’s gentleman to remove his master’s body into a hearse the Servants had brought to carry him to his own house at Madrid. Then he returned to the lady, to whom he administered the last rites of the church, and about four in the morning She expired.
I need, not tell you how enraged my father, and all our family, was ' against the cruel Alvares, when this story was known; nor were Don Lorenzo ’s friends less afflicted : but alvares’s family did ail that was pof sible to obtain his pardon of the king, pleading the enormity of her crime,
"p r q nf"!
o
and the justice of bis procedure; and that he could do no less than Sacrifice both her and her paramour to repair his honour; that the injury was unpardonable in both; that the cruelty he had exercised on his lady was excufa blo, considering the greatness of the provocation. In fine, they fald all they could in his defence, whilst her family and Don lorenzo’s used all their interest against him, and were so potent, that though the king was inclined .to forgive and only banish him, yet he deferred to declare himself, and so gave him time to get off with much wealth, having sold off Secretly and made conveyances of his estate, before a process could be got out against him : however, he was fried and condemned, when he was got out of the reach of the laws. My grandmother broke her heart for her unfortunate daughter. ravina’^s father and family, and mine, though they joined in prosecuting Don Alvarez, yet conceived a mortal aversion to one
anor

another, and much blood was Spilled on both fides by duels and rencounters; so that Some few years after the king honoured her father with this great post in the Indies, to prevent a farther effusion of blood and quarrels. I was too young at this fatal jundiure, when these misfortunes happened; but ra vina and I growing older, my soul was charmed with her beauty; and though I could see no hopes of ever gaining her’s or her father’s consent, yet I could not forbear loving, or desist from pursuing her : my quality and fortune made way, and having nothing to urge against me but a family difference, the charming Ravina consulting reason and religion, saw the folly and injustice of that procedure, and gave ear ta my persuasions: At last She ge laeroufly confested a pafifion for me, and promised to he mine provided I could gain her fathers consent. I then applied to my father, who acquainted the king with our mutual affection,
and pleading that this was the only
way

way to reconcile the two Samilies, and put an end to that fatal strife that had been of such ill consequences to both, prevailed With his majesty to propose it to elvira’s father; but he delaying to give a positive answer, having before obtained the viceroystiip, went off without it, and so obliged me to follow him. I obtained a letter from the king, in which he even commanded him to give me Ravina, and let our marriage be forthwith consummated my family and hers all joined in this, and I departed Spain with a whole packet full of letters to this effedf. I was certain of not being refused now, stnce he did not dare to disoblige or disobey the king. I arrived Safely at Mexico, and was well received according to my expedsation, and Soon after married to my dear Raviiia : and now being completely happy, we studied how to divert ourselves, and take all the innocent diversions the land and sea afforded; being at a plea

lake, we went aboard a yatch one evening to take the air upon the Sea, it being fine weather, and resolved to Spend the night in nrirth and pleasure. We had Several ladids and gentlemen with ns, with music. We Supped, danced, and were very merry; but about midnight a terrible storm blew, after having been tosted about many days and nights, not knowing where we were, we were driven upon a bank of fand near this Shore. Here we lay bulging till Such time as the yatch was torn to pieces, then every one Shifted for himself: Ravina and our friends were got into the boat, I placed myself near to her, resolving to bear her to. shore, if postible, on my back, in cafe the boat should not hold out the f orm to the shore, as it happened, for it was Soon Swallowed up in the waves L I catched fast hold of her, bidding her throw her arms about my neck; and it being now day, I made for the shore which I Saw before me; but my strength being almost Spent before I

The) dragged me on Shore out of the read of the waves, which would have washed us away; there the good father came to our relief. Thus the divine providence has preserved our live? and yours in a miraculous manner, and will, I hope, furnish us with means to return to our homes in health and
Safety.
Thus don Bellaries ended his relation, and they pasted a few days as agreeably as the difmalnefs of their abode would permit, the monk visited shem every day, when the Savages

Saw Some white men, who appeared to be Europeans by their habit, sitting round a fire boiling a pot on the Shore; their firearms being muskets, lay by them. He Saw that a pinnace lay on the Shore, and discerned the strip lying at anchor about hals a league off: he made signs to them to permit him to come near; they answered, and he hasted to them, and found they were come from the istand of St. christopher’s, and bound to Spain: He told them of the Spaniards that he had saved, and prevailed with them to take them orr board their Ship; he went and called them, and they were overjoyed to get thence,, and meet with such a lucky opportunity; and the monk thanked God that he was rid of them, being uneasy whilst they were on that Shore, lest they Should discover his concealed friends whom he dearly esteemed, but these he ab horred, as being villains,. They went

Now they consult about getting to Carthagena; by lai it was very dangerous, and by I very difficult; for they had the Sages to fear as they travelled, a: dreadful mountains and woods to p; through; no boat of strength suffi ent to carry them, and not provifi enough for a voyage of so many ds at sea; and what was worse, no pi to guide the vestel, if they had h one. In fine, they knew not wl course to take : at last they refolv
 13
to venture to cross the great river Oroonoko in the Savages fishing boat. This being resolved, trusting to providence, they .prepared to go; but the night before they were to depart, they Saw a man running down the adjacerit hill, pursued by a fierce tiger: he had a drawn Sword in his hand, and a strange fashioned coat made of beasts Ikins : he had no Shoes or stockings, but pieces of bears skins tied about his legs with twigs; his head had a strange fur cap on; his face they could Scarce distinguish, till coming into the wood, he climbed up a tree, and the beast pursuing him to the foot of it, lean der, who had fetched a gun, Shot it dead, having perceived the man was a white, and his countenance no Indian. No sooner was the beast killed, but the man leapt down from the tree, and ran to embrace his benefactor, whose surprise cannot be expressed when he saw his face, and heard him call him by his name, and knew it
was the honest captain of the Ship
who

who lived at Virginia, and had carried him and his friend Dumarefquc to the island of St. Domingo. Elvira
and her dear Bellario, who were retired at the strangecs approach, hearing them talk, came forth, and invited him in, being together in the hermitage, for that was properly the name of their cell: they alked him to eat, a favour he gladly accepted of; Phrlena fet what proviiions they had before him, as cold fowl, goats milk, bread, dried grapes, and water, and wine made of their juice; a noble feast to a man who had lived for above five weeks on roots and fruits. Such as the woods produced, and had not tasted any dressed food, neither bread, meat nor fish. Being much refreshed, he related to them the manner of his coming thither.
I was going on a voyage for Some merchants, said he, to Barbados about six weeks ago, my Ship being heavy laden with goods for that place, at which I was to unload, and take in
others

bthers for other ifiands : I had a Sair gale of wind and good voyage, till I came near the Summer iflands; then a storm arose and drove the Ship up this river, where it was dashed to pieces against Some rocks, amongst Some unknown, and I suppose uninhabited istands. I had but eight men and a boy aboard, two of whom were blown off the Shrouds into the Sea: ihose that were left got out the boat, and we quitted the Shattered vestel, which was full of water above the first deck, and committed ourselves to the mercy of God. The night was dark as pitch, and we knew not which way to steer. At last the boat, unable to hold out against the dreadful waves that bore her up to the Skies one moment, and then opening. Seemed to fink her into the bottomless deep, the wreck being filled with water by a great Sea that washed over her, sunk; and then we gave ourselves over for lost, and were ail Separated, never to
meet again in this world, I fear. Nature
J
ii
ture taught me, though hopeless, to if^uggle for life; and it being jufi break of day, I difeerned the Shore, and made for it; the wind sitting fair, helped me greatly. At last I reached it half dead, and sitting down on the fide of a rock to recover myself, looked round to see where I was, and soon found that I was cast on this inhospitable Shore, where I must expest to be devoured either by men or beasts; this made me almost repent that I had escaped drowning. I had no arms nor food, and my soul being full of horrible apprehensions of the, Cannibal savages, I sought for a place
to hide myself in, and looking about, crept into a hole in a great rock, not far from that on which I sat down; and being quite spent with the fatigue of the past night, I fell into a profound steep, out of which I was awakened some hours after by two Savages, who were stripping me, and had already gpt my shoes and stockings; but going to pull off my coat and waistcoat,
which

which they could not do without lifting me up, I awakened, and looking up, caught one of them by the throat; and wrenching this Sword out of his hand, he broke from me, carrying away my clothes, which he held so fast that he tore my coat and waistcoat off as he broke from me, and they both fled wdth incredible celerity.
I was now left almost naked, and fearing they would return wdth more Savages, and fall upon me, I fled up into the woods, not knowing where else to hide myself, but amongst the trees and bushes. And now being ready to faint with hunger, I searched about for wild fruits and roots, and eat whatever 1 could find, which, alas! instead of satisfying my hungry, ^ stomach, made me sick. I sat in a.
y >* T
tree all that night, and the next day so soon as it was light, crept down to the Shore, to see if I. could espy a boat, or any of my stiilors who might have escaped like me to the Shore; and there, to my great surprise, I saw
my
11^
my boat lying on the Sands, and was fansported to find her there, thinking I might get off with her the next tide, and reach Some of our ifiands. So Soon as the wa ter stowed, and the Sea com ing in, fet her astoat; I ran down, and leaping into her, steered her by the rudder along the shore, but Sound I was not able to govern her at Sea: I wanted strength and more hands, had neither oars nor Sails, yet I Seared to lose her; and finding I could not venture out with her, I resolved, if postible, to Secure her in Some place where the Savages should not find her, in hopes that I might meet with Some Christians here whom chance had broiight, like me, to this Barbarous land, who would be glad to escape hence, and astfist me to get away in her. I borough the boat accordingly. along the shore, till I came to a kind of a creek. So covered with trees, that it was almost impostible to perceive anything that lay there. I brought hex into this creek, at the end
of
 iio
of which was a very thick wood; and having hailed her on stiore, broke down a great many of the green branches of the trees, and made a kind of bower over it, so that it lies quite covered; I have lain aboard it every night since: I have every day ranged about for foocl, and lived chiefly on the eggs of the sea fowl and turtles, which I found in the rocks and OH the Sands, nor did I dare attempt to make a fire to dress anything, for fear of discovery, foi sustained life by sucking them, and eating turtles raw, laying the flesh in the fun till it was hot, and then I eat it as favorily as if it had been the greatest dainty in the world. I knew not what to do for clothes, but one day finding two bears cubs in a wood, I killed and stead them, hanging their steins on the hedges to dry, these I made into the strange fashioned coat I have on : I killed some young goats also, and eating the stefh, made me a cap and fpatterdashes with the skins, as you see.
But
no
But I must now acquaint you with the most Surprising accident that ever befell any man living. One morning roaming about a wood, I met with a young woman fair as Venus, but pale as death; She was wrapped in a piece of Sailcloth, having nothing under but a fine Holland stiift, a white dimity petticoat and waistcoat, and no headclothes, but her hair, which was the finest light brown, hung in curls down to her waist; but all this was hid under her canvas wrapper; she Seemed half famished, and was so surprised at the sight of me, supposing me a Savage, that she ran away from me as fast as she was able. I followed her till she ran into a cave, into which I entered, and getting hold ofher, spoke in English, ashing her who she was, and of what nation. She Seemed Surprised to the last degree, and Said, pray do not kill or be rude with me; I am a poorimfortunate maid, Said she, whoby cruel guardians was trepanned and Sent away for Jamaica; but our ship being

drove on this coast, was lost, and I with one young man, who was the captain’s kinsman, were Saved on this unhappy coast: here we lived together for three days, but the fourth, going out of the cave as usual to seek for food, he never returned, and is I fear murdered. I have lived in this dismal place two months, all alone, under the most dreadful apprehensions imaginable, almost famished and pinched with cold and damps; not daring to go far from my cave for fear of meeting the Savages, I was charmed with her tears, and pierced to the soul with her condition. I told her my story, and begg’d her to go along with me, and live in the boat, promising to protect her with my life, and provide her with Such food as I coiild get; nay more, that I would offer no rude ness to her. She, with some difficulty, yielded to my request, fbi conducted her to my bower, and we vol. II G have

Ahd now with your leave, I will. haste and fetch my dear Polly, whom 1 have promis’d to make my wife so soon as I reach a Christian Shore: She is in pain for my return, I am certain. You shall make your promise good to her. Said le ander, tomorrow morning; we have here a worthy Christian priest who Shall marry you; and Since you have a boat able to carry us all, he

dent for a voyage to one of the Summer islands, from whence we may get a Ship to carry us to Virginia, and thence to what other place we think fit. The captain hasted to fetch the lady, who in less than an. hour reach’d the Hermitage, and was joyfully receiv’d by Bellario, Leander, and Ravina; who never Saw Such a figure as She appear’d, wrapp’d in her canvas stiroud, for Such it feem’d j a habit which very ill suited her beautiful face and charming mien. After eating together with thankful hearts, as - much transported at this meeting as if they had forgot their misfortunes, they laid them down to steep on straw, having recommended themselves to God; and rested sweetly, having no load of guilt upon their consciences, biit minds re fign’d to the Supreme Disposer of all things. Next morning the monk visited them, and was entertain’d

with   these new guests, whom he immediately marry’d; saying, My children, it is not fit that you Should live in sin; and Since the necestity of your condition obliged you to live together, and a too near intimacy has I find enfisd, it is fit that you Should be join’d by the holy bonds of matrimony, that none amongst us may incur god’s anger, but that blesstngs may attend us. And now they thought of nothing but preparing for their departure from this place. The monk inform’d the honest Savages, whom he offer’d to take along with them, and they executed his commands with Such alacrity, that he was surpriz’d. In three days they got out the boat and vidluard her, carrying aboard boil’d fowls, Salted fish, and store of ', bread, with freshwater in jars. The Savage and his Son made oars, well understanding the management

All things being ready, our joyful Christians went on board, and the three w'ornen and children lay down in the boat, being cover’d over with Some boughs of trees; the monk, Leander, the captain, and and savages rowed and steered the boat, having made sails of what
'O ^ V
the pocr savages procured. They pasted Safely out ot the river; and being at Sea, steered for Barbados, which they reached in a few days, having a fair wind and fine weather: they were well received by a merchant there, who was the captain’s friend, and Soon got a pastage to Virginia; Bellario, and Ravina, with their maid Philena, going with them,

carry them to Mexico by reason of the war. When they arrived at Virginia, Leander had the agreeable news, that his kinsman had in his absence Sent a bark with letters for him from himself and Harriot, to ac <]uaint him that the Governor was dead, and that they designed to Sell off all their effcdts in the iffand of St, Domingo, and come for Virginia, leaving only harriot’s two children behind, whom her hushand’s friends would not part with. He w, asso transported with this news that he could
hardly be persuaded to wait her coming, but would fain have gone to fetch her; but four days after hisarrival, she and Lavinia, with his faithful friend, arrived with an immense treasure. Never was amore moving sight than the meeting of these three persons; Leander, clasping his dear Harriot, in his arms, stood motionless, as if he meant to die in that posture, and that his ravished Soul would make

His eyes Seemed, fixed on her Sace, the big drops escapiug. them, whilst fiery love Sparkled in his eyeballs, as if the raging flame within Sent forth those crystal drops: She hung upon his neck, and cry’d, ‘ Do Hive, and again See ‘ Leandei!

Leander was So irn patient to secure his happiness; that he never gave over importuning Harriot till She consented to marry him that very night; and the monk accordingly wedded them, and they were mutually pleased: : what greater satissadtion can mortals attain in this life, than to poffess the person they ardently love, especially when they have So long languished for one another, and been So long feparated.f* this IS a pleasure none but lovers can have a true notion of.

This report soon reached the principal of the college’s ear, and he had me watched, and Sent my father word, who immediately Sent for me home, and Scolded me Sharply, commanding

went in, taking the strong box, which was not above two Soot and a half Square, but very heavy.

So I made towards a river, where there used to be a ferryboat constantly, thinking to offer the old ferryman, who knew me, a piece of gold if he would carry me over, and convey my box for me to Some town where I might get a disguife, and a horse to carry me to Alicia's father’s, whose removal to the poor village I knew nothing of.

The good man being called, we all rejoiced at our happy meeting, and coniulted what was next to be done; it was altogether improper for me to stay there but a day, for there my father would be Sure to look for me, and where elfe to go or how to part with Alicia on any account, I could not resolve j at last the good man proposed to me to go to a benedictine monk who was his confestbr, and trust him with the whole affair, and ask his advice and ashstance:

All things Succeeded as we expected : about noon officers came to search my father in law’s house, examined him, Alicia, her mother, and their man and maid, who all pretended ignorance; and finding they could get no Satisfaction or intelligence where I was, they went away: this Alicia gave me an account of at night. Father Dominic, the good benedictine, provided us horses and a guide for the next morning, and gave me letters of recommendation to Several priests and persons of quality in gascoigne,

My dear Alicia and I, returning a thousand thanks to him and the lady, took leave; I presented the father with twenty pistoles as a present for his convent, gave three amongst the lady’s Servants; and being both drested in metes clothes like Servants in livery coats, being Some of the lady’s Servants clothes, we departed. I haa given alicia’s father a hundred pistoles, and agreed that he and her mother Should come to us so fbon as Alicia and I had taken ahoufe, and were Settled; we had very fine weather and a safe journey, tho’ much fatigued in passing the Pyrenean mountains : and having presented my letters to the pershns to whom they were directed,

So fbon as we arrived in France, I Sent back my guide and horses, with letters to the good old father, the lady, and my father and mother in law. On the receipt of which. Father Dominic writ to my own father, acquainting him that I was married to Alicia, and gone out of the kingdom; that I was extremely Sorry he had constrained me to leave him in Such a manner, and was willing to return to him, if he would forgive me. and receive my wife into favour. In fine, he urged all he could think of to reconcile us, and received an answer, by which he found my father was implacable, and So incensed against me, that it was in vain to hope for

My father and mother in law came to us, and having taken a pretty house and Some lands, he managed our little estate, and my wife and I kept the best company in the province, and lived at ease; it did not please God to bless our marriage with any chil ■drenj but everything else prospered with us. I writ often to father Dominic, sending him presents of what 1 thought might be acceptable, particularly wine, of which I had enough, having now bought a little vineyard : he sent to my father to let him know that i was well, and longed to visit him, but for ieven whole years could never perceive*by his answers that his displeasure was abated.

But alas, my oversight had drawn him into another during my absence, he had taken a young hand ibme kinswoman into the house and debauched her; this was a Secret could not be long hid from me; She was Saucy and insolent to my wife which I resented, and desired my father’s leave to return to France he desired me not to leave him any more, and would know the cause of my ■ disgust, and who had offended me: at last I modestly told him, our pert kinswaman took too much upon her; he coloured, and said it Should be remedied; but, as I afterwards discovered, he had two Sons by her, and knew not how to get

all the circumstances of the murder. She had committed on Alicia. My
father was So struck with the manner of her death, and stiame, his crime with her being now made public, that he seldom went out of his chamber. Our meeting was at this time very different from our parting; I fell at his feet with the greatest Submistion, and with tears begged pardon for the follies I had committed in my youth; he wept over me, and lifting me up, embraced me, unable to utter one word: then his countenance expressed the confusion of his thoughts; he biufhed at. his own weaknefs, and could not look me in the face: at last he Said, my Son, we have both offended God, but I more grievousty; God pardon me, as I do you.

She had robbed my father of near two thousand pounds; but Du Pre pealed her of a good deal of it. She kept me very fine, carried me to the parks, the plays, and had me taught to dance, sing, and play on the fpinnet: in fine. She took pains to make me agreeable, but none to instruct me in virtue and goodness yet God had given me the grace ta abhor her way of living; and I often wept for her sins in secret, and wished myself in prison with my good father,, or if he was poor and at liberty, that I might beg for him, rather than be a mistress. *. short, in about two years time, my mother had broke two or three merchants and a linen draper, She was

told him my story. He was a very good man, and writ up to London to a friend, whom he ordered to find out the tally man, and threaten him,; and try to find what they designed to do with me, and what
my mother had lest me. This gentleman did So, and Gripe laid all the fault on Du Pre, and promised to Send for me up to London; which he immediately did. At my arrival, he treated me kindly.. Then Du Pre and he contrived to get rid of me for good and all; So they seemed mighty ready to send me to my father, in order to which they went with me on board a strip that lay in the river, bound, as they pretended, for Bristol, and ready to fail. They had, bought me new clothes, and given me my mother’s watch and being young and ignorant, I did not suspect their villainy. Du Pre pretended he would go along with me, and the tall

I knew it was a great way to Bristol by Sea, yet was every hour ashing when we should get thither, snq how far we were got, A youno*
man, who was the captain’s nephew, and a very honest youth, taking ' pity of me, told me, ^ that I was. ‘ not going thither, but tojamaica :

no notice of his discovering this Secret to me; * for if you do, said he,
* I am undone, my whole depen dance being upon my uncle, and

Then I told him all my story, and of the fortune I had, of which these villains wronged me, and that if he could find means to get me ashore anywhere in England, and would go with me to my father, I would give him part of my fortune he Should
desire in reason, when it was reco

vered, as it would Soon be. He answered, that he had other terms to propose, which was, that I would promise to marry him in cafe he delivered me, and then he would tree me out of his hands, tho’ I went to Jamaica, which he feared I ' must do now, because we were past the land, and out at Sea : ^ for so

After this Du Pre, for that was his name, studied how to oblige me, and took Such care of me, that tho’ there were two wild young men, a merchant’s Son and a mercer’s aboard the strip, sent by their fathers for no

Just as he Spoke these words, Monsieur De Leste and Flavia entered the room; Leander and Harriot Saluted her : dear kinswoman.

Indeed, Said she, when he came (p the grates of the convent to ash sot me, I could Scarcely credit my eyes, he was So changed: but I Soon threw aside my veil, and fled to his arms with as much affection as at the first months of our marriage.

There were few in the place who knew Harriot; but from them Ihe learned the Sad news that her ancient father was in prison, and had lain there five years; his wife’s, debts, which She had wickedly contrasfed, having entirely ruined him; stie would not stay a moment after this information, but flew to the prison winged with filial piety and tender affe^ion : She asked for him So earnestly, that the goalcr was startled; but clapping half a crown in his hand, he let her in; stie quickly saw her dejedted Sather,

The tears streamed down her face, and her voice faltered, So that She could utter no more, but clasping her arms about the old ■ man’s neck, Said, My dear father, and fainted.

Leander called for Soma help, two or three prisoners came, vvbofe meagre faces and poor habit Spoke their miseries; they astisted him to lift Monsieur Le Montague into a poor room, where his bed lay on the floor, and Leander carried Harriot in his arms, who by this time recovered : he called for

Clementina gave them an account of all the strange adventures She had met with in. Barbary, which filled them; with admiration.
One morning (a French ship having come into the port in the night) an old man in very poor habit came to young Monsieur Le Montague's housc, and desired to be admitted to Speak with Clementina. She was at breakfast with her husband, and bid the Servants admit him; but was extremely Surprised when fhc Saw his face, and knew that he was the old French captain who had carried her to Canada. ‘ Madam Said.

Their dress was as mean as their psrfons were noble, being Such as charity had, furrststied them withal. Clementina Saluted aad welcomed her to France, not knowing whether She understood her or not.

You know, laid he, that my father dying whilst we were Schoolfellows, I was left in the hands of the two rich east-india merchants, Monsieur Dandin and Monsieur du fresne : Dandin had but one daughter, who was as deformed as esop, and as ill natured as stie was proud and ugly. My fortune was very confiderabse, and his whole aim was to match me to Magdelairi, and fa Secure it to his posterity. I was but thirteen, and he wheedled me into signing a contract with her; and She being twenty, was not a little pleasest to have Such a fine young husband. She took much upon her, and So tutored and Schooled me upon every occasion, that my aycrfion'daily increased towards her.

I was fain to hand her about to every place she was pleased to gad to; and at last it was my fortune to go with her to a Chapel near the monastery where you and my dear Elvira were pensioners; there I saw you and her together : you I knew, because my friend monsicur le Montague had Showed you to me; for students always tell their amours to one another, and I am younger than he, so that he had a mistress before me. I was so charmed with her, that had not my fury been along with me, I had followed you to the convent: but I soon found an opportunity to go thither, and found you gone. I got to the fj: eech of her, and in sometime gained my charmer’s consent to marry me Secretly, She, you know, was an orphan, whon being related to the abbess your aunt, was bred, there with design (having but a Small fortune) to be made a nun. Being

blit a joenfioner, it was no difficulc thing for her to come to me j but my keeping my marriage a Secret till I was of age, was a hard thing to be done. My guardians did not keep me fiiort of money, So that I fancied I could easily maintain her if I could but get some faithful friend for her to live withal privately in the house with his wife and family, or elfe a private lodging. This last I thought most Secure, and accordingly took a chamber in a widow woman’s honfe in a village. Having thus provided a retreat, and engaged my confessor to marry us, I gave her notice, and She got out the next morning with another pensioner, on pretence of going to church to the chapel.i had Seen her at : I waited for her in a coach near the chapel, and coming out in the crowd. She slipped from her corppanion, and turning back into the church went out at another door, shere I took her

Thence we went aw’^ay to the village, to our lodging, where I had provided a dinner and all things for our reception. The widow’s daughter, a very modest young maid I had hired to wait on her.. Here I staid all night, having, pretended to old Dandin, my guardian,
that I was to go out of town with a young gentleman whom I kept company withal, and whom I had trusted with my Secret, and engaged to ask me to go. with him before my guardian and Magdelain, nay crooked rib that was to be. la fine, I kept my dear Elvira here Some months, tho’ a great Search was made after her, being very cautious in my visi: s. She was that time with child, but mifearried. She never stirred out of doors without a mask, or when I fetched her out in a coach but finding it was inconvenient to
have

 87
have her So far off, I removed her to St. mate’s, and took a lodging for her at a widow’s house in a back Street, in a very private place, with a garden, and back door into the fields. In this garden, Elvira used to walk, and venture Sometimes to look out of her windows into it.
■ A young lord who often pasted by that way. Saw and fell in love with her: he Soon inquired who kept the hduse, and learned that it was a widow who had a young gentlewoman and her Servant lodged with her. He, emboldened by his quality and fortune,, went to the house in a chair, richly dressed, and alked to see the lady, the young gentlewoman that lodged there : the woman feeing his attendance and habit, was daunted. He asked no leave, but going by her, went upstairs, and found Elvira sitting in her chamber reading: She was doubtless Surprised, but he told her his
business.
iss
business was love, and in fine would take no denial, or be gone. He fnpposed her a mist refs by the place she resided in, being So mean and obfcnre, and resolved to poffess her whatever it cost. She told him she was married, but he turned that into ridicule : before he went he presented her with a fine diamond ring, whidi she resufing, he left it upon the table. He went not away till midnight; the next morning I found her in tears, she toldme whatamis fortiine had befallen her. I was
'now but Seventeen, and the expense of maimaining her and a Servant, So Sunk my allowance, that I had no money by me • and being Something indebted to the widow, I knew not how at present to remove her. In fine, this young nobleman, who was mad in love.with her, continued frequently to visit her, and Set fpys to discover who kept her, who quickly got knowledge

of the Secret. This young lord, who was one of the most powerful persons and had the greatest fortune of any nobleman in the place, knew my guardian, and Sent privately for him, telling him, as out of friendship, the matter. mon fieiir Dandin, says he, yon have a young heir who is contracted to your daughter, who will be ruined; he keeps a mistress. in Such a place, his your duty and interest to put an end to Such an intrigue, and Save the youth from being undone. My guardian promised never to reveal who told him, and returned him a thousand thanks; he came home and took no notice to me, but watched me the next time I went out, and dogged me to elvira’s lodging, at my return home he told me I must make the tour of Europe, or marry his daughter next week. I was ready to go distracfed before, but now I was quite overwhelmed.

One morning when I was in bed, he entered my chamber, Searched, my pockets, took away all the money I had left, with my watch, and addressed himself to me in the following manner, young gentleman, I am informed you keep a mistress, your allowance Shall be shortened; you are like to prove a good man and an excellent husband, that begin So Soon. I was So enraged, I lost all patience; I told him I would never marry his daughter, and that So Soon as I was of age I would call him to an account. I know not what I Said, but we quarrelled to that degree, that I rose and went out of the house, protesting that I would never Set foot in it again,
I went directly to Elvira, but cannot express the transport of sorrow I was in when I came there, and found the poor widow and the .maid in fears, who told me, that at

I returned to my guardian like an enraged lion, demanded my wife, declaring my marriage : this made him as furious as I; he threatened to Sue me for the contradf with his daughter; I applied myself to Several of my relations and friends to afisist me against him, but nobody cared to meddle; for he was known to be very rich and a very cunning man; I then challenged the young lord, charging him with stealing her. but he only laughed at and ridiculed me. At last being unable to get any news of her, I resolved to travel, believing they had murdered her. I was deeply melancholy; and my guardian, who indeed knew not what was become of Elvira, was willing to be rid of me, and readily agreed to my going to travel. I designed to go first to Rome, and from thence to make the tour of Europe, and return to France So Soon as I was of age, to
be

see revenged of my guardian. He agreed to make me a handsome allowance, and gave me five hundred pistoles to defray my extraordinary expenses, being willing to be reconciled to me before the day of r^kon
ing came. Attended by a Servant I Set out on my journey, and reached Rome, having viewed all at was curious in my way thither thro’ Spain. I resolved to stay there Some time, and took a lodging for that purpose, One morning my Servant waked me. Saying there was. a youth, who Said he was come post from France to me. - I bad him call him up; when he entered my chamber, he made a sign with his hand that I Should send away the Servant; I did So, he then ran to me

She had no other help but these women; and falling into a fever, lay lick in her bed three months unable to rise; all

which time the young lord continually visited her, bringing a physician Several times: at last recovering So as to be able to walk about her chamber. She began to confider how to make her escape. By this time, as She afterwards learned, I having declared our marriage, the young lord refrained from visiting her Some days.
One afternoon he came, and being alone with her, he said thus to her, * I am come to ash your par

* So excesiive, that it blinded my ^ reason. I believed you ruin’d by ‘ a man who was pre engaged to ‘ another, and was not naif so well ‘ able to take care of you as myself:

habit, and having received a thousand pistoles from him. Set out for Rome, attended by one of his Servants. Nothing could be more welcome than She was to me, and I concluded that the dilguife Ihe had on was the best in the world to conceal her till I was of age, and farther misfortunes, which her beauty in a female dress might again occasion. I now wanted but a year and half of being of age, and had no mind to return to France till that time was elaps’d; So we removed to a lodging Some miles from Rome, where Elvira, who pass’d for my kinsman, lived with me 5 we pasted the day very agreeably: at last we embarked aboard a vessel' ' for marsailles, and Set sail with a fair wind; but in few hours a terrible storm drove us out to Sea, and we were driven for eight and forty hours before the wind, iri which time our Ship was so disabled, that she Sprung a leak, and

but! Soon perceived he had a wicked design on Elvira, whom he dres sed in a fine Turkilh dress, and treated with great indulgence, I was Seized with Such dreadful apprehensions at this procedurej that I resolved to run all hazards to es cape his hands. This put us on a project which we happily effected; the French captain, who brought us home, was at that time Ills stave, he had been So to his Sather, who was a general; and had treated him
very cruelly: by his death he fell
into this barbarian’s hands, who
* '
was a good naturedman; and finding him skilled in sea affairs, had made him master of a very neat pleasarc boat he used to goiout to Sea in for his diversion; he ijkev/ise trusted us to go out in her with other staves, natives of Tunis, to fistr for him. The French captain was generally thus employed in the fumiuer Seiiibn, and was much in his favour; I was aften lent aboard

with himj but Elvira never. I con tradfed a friendship with him, and we contrived our escape thence in this manner; he had got knowledge of the Christian fisherman and his Vvdfe, where you had lived; he directed ine thither, and we agreed that Elvira and I should retire to that place, which was not very dif ' ficult for us to do, since we had the liberty of walking the town, that he should send Some of the staves on shore, and bring the pleasure boat about in the dusk of the evening, and take us in. All our. hope was to get to Malta in this .flight vessel, a very dangerous undertaking; but our condition made ns resolve to trust to Providence, and venture all risques to get out of the infidel’s hands. There was a lovely maid who had been Sold to thisbasta Some months before, whose name was Rofietta; she was a farmer’s daughter at Poictou; who was in qualityof a Servant with a

lady that was going with her Saniily to her husband, a merchant, who was Settled in the West Indies; and the Ship being taken by a pirate of Tunis, she was made a stave, and So fell into this pirate’s hands. With this maid the captain was fallen in love, he Sent her along with us to the fffherman’s. All things being ready, and the Bassa absent, being Sent for to the court, we got away, as agreed, and the captain came according to appointment; and it plcased God that we arrived Safely at Malta in four days time, the the Algerine staves not in the least fufpe<5ting our design till they saw the veftel enter the Port; they were but five in number, and unarmed. So that we had not anything to fear from them, being on our guard. Hence we were received as became Christians, and furnished with clothes: we got a pastage in a French Ship that put in there.
