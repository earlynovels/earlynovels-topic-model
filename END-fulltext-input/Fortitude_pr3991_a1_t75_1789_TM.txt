art of giving youth a proper idea of the world, without the danger of imbibing its vices. Above all, he is to be admired for the regard he pays to the principle oi honour — that fa icred tie, which is the bond of virtue between man and man.

with all that composure which mark

O, Frank, excuse my warmth; excuse me when I mourn at once over my country and my friend: Yet why mourn over him he fell as a Soldier should do.

THE comments which you made,.

The degree of re Sped: due to our relations, is a Subject which I do not mean here to discuss. As to your good kinsfolks, they have their Singularities; So have most women vvhen they arrive at the other fide of fifty. It is rather unhappy that these Should excite - disgust in j/oit: to me they have often proved rather matter of entertainment.
All the news I can impart to you from the Land of Love is, that my incognita as I termed her, my Arne -- lia, remains as tranquil as possible, at Mrs. sibley’s; :, only I think Sometimes she feemis rather rufssed at the notion of being in Something like a state of dependance, though ihe uses as little as possible of my proffered

astistance. But there are Some things in her condudf, of which I Should be glad to get an explanation.
For instance, when I went to visit her yesterday, I found her in conference with an elderly woman, who arose, as if impatient to depart, as Soon as I entered the room. I wished to know Somewhat of this visitor; but as I had made a sort of promise to Amelia, when first she trusted herself
to my protection, not to be in

She Seemed too as if She had been weeping.. I asked whether stie was any way indisposed— — answered in the negative; and fell into a dis courfe on indifferent matters, without giving the most distant hint that anything had disturbed her.

MISS CAROLINE STANMORE TO MISS
ELIZA ELSE.,
Marlborough, May the aift.
TT is an age, my Dear, since I have heard from you; and, believe me, I have felt much since from your Silence, as you are Sensible you were ever next my heart; and, if I know il aright, you will ever remain So. Indeed I have always conceived, though with fubmifiion to the opinion of my elders, and those whose greater faml Harity of life should ripen their judgement,
OF F ORT I T 0 D E. igt
merit, that connexions of this kind,, formed in youth, are most likely, to prove strong and lasting; and that,, as a modern Poet Says,
\
No after friend/hip e’er can raise Th’ affection of our earlier days.”
The rest of the stanza I do not pretend to pass a judgement on, but am inclined to take the author’s word for it, though written in a style of lamentation. Such as people are apt to indulge, when they mourn over the remains of departed pleasures.
After all, my Dear, why is age to be deplored — I mean by such as have Spent the morning of life, in attending to the dictates of wisdom I Suppose all that can be Said in this
respect..

respect, is, that it is one of the weaknesses of our nature, over which but few can triumph.
In my last I told you, I expelled to go on a party to Lord bellgrove’s, by her ladyship’s invitation: I should have dated this from Bellgrove Placcj but for my mother’s being indisposed. That best of parents, who wishes me to take every innocent recreation, was urgent with me to go, but I deferred it; for I could taste no pleasure while I knew she was experiencing the flightest degree of pain. Eliza, she is so good a mother, that all the encomiums I have ever pasted on her, fall far short of what she deserves— — she otherwise, I should always account such conduct as a duty — but
now

now it is enforced bv filial love. As to my father, you know him, hasty in his temper, but affedlionate, and capable of all the noble feelings of the heart. His absence, however, at this juncture, rendered my presence the more necessary. I thought I could do for my mother what no nurse nor hired attendant could perform. To sooth the bed of sickness is the proper part of the nearest and dearest relation. This was my endeavour; and I flatter myself that I have contributed to the re establish ment of her health who is so dear to me. A few minutes ago I parted from her, and was happy to see her appear with all her wonted cheer fullness.

Bellgrovc place, as I understandis, by this time, the Scene of more than rural pleasure; I Say more, because, wherever those of the fashionable world altemble, in Spite of all they can do to rufticate. Art will generally appear to prevail over Nature, even in those Scenes where they pur pose to display her in her Amplest dress, and they will not forget them selves as they profess to do.
But do not imagine, my Dear, that ' I mean to go on a visit with intent to criticise, and thereby to make myself unhappy. these are only the overflowings of Sentiment: — this is no more than thinking aloud: for Such
$
I conceive the communication of opinions to a friend; and if my Eliza
were

were not one, I think I might Search the world around in vain, to find a
person answering to the description.
But I must break off here. The family of Bellgrove having heard of my mother’s recovery, impatient of farther delay, have Sent to urge their invitation in the most pressing manner. — I mujl Set out, they say, tomorrow — I go to return an answer, and, from the dispofition of things here, it will be in the affirmative. — Farewell, Eliza. Let me have a line Soon, or you will redouble the anxiety tthat is felt for you, by her who is

The indispofition of a parent occasioned you, my Dear, to defer your visit to Bellgrove place. — An indisposition of mine prevented my writing to my friend, the sister of my choice; and this I attribute chiefly to my uncle’s hastening me with the rest of the family to the metropolis, for he never can think of leaving one behind him, at least one who wears petticoats. Some affairs of his own, which he did not choose to communicate, caused this journey, the suddenness of which, and the hurry it occasioned, were too much for one whose spirits often exceed her strength — this, by the bye, as a sort of fide wind felf commendation. — But So it was; and my good kinf vol.

man, according to his usual method, had no Sooner made me a little ill, than he began to call in more aid than vas necessary qs the Saculty, who, according to their custom, ordered, as I Suppose, more medicines than were necessary to remove a slight malady. However, as they did not kill me by potion, pill, or bleeding, having recovered my strength, perhaps more by nature’s assistance than theirs, I once again write to my Caroline, whose letters to me are ever welcome.
I am happy to hear of the recovery of Mrs. Stanmore; I ssiould be yet more happy to hear of your father’s return to thofevvdiom he professes to be so dear to him, whose feelings for

I have promised you that when “the wanton god that pierces hearts” assails mine you shall be my confidant, as you are my friend; and, ferioussy, I think we may be the better for each other’s advice; though I confess there seems to be a little vanity on my fide in the supposition.

instead of one out of the Seven, at his villa, as he terms it, his country retirement, near Some dusty road, and enveloped, almost as much as ever, in the smoke of the metropolis; but I am condemned to spend my time ia the aeighboorlicjod of Soho ^ being only fbmetimes indolg^ with a Jaunt in the chariot, perhaps to the city on hnstnefs, or, at hell, to the extremity of one of the new Squares at Maryhone, where Ibme acquaintance of my imcle*s resde. As to public diveriions, they are rather dead, here ^ and if they were not, you know my kinfinaa and guardian is not very willing that I lliouici have much enjoyment of them. — The

32
gardens in general, he observes, are quite vulgar, Ranelagh excepted, which he approves So well, that he has taken me thither twice, in company with his lister, (I should Say, my aunt) an old lady, resident in London, whom I have not Seen three times before within these Seven years. The music, including vocal and instrumental performances, was very agreeable — for anything elfe, except the building, I did not See much to admire. With deference to my uncle’s judgement, in this his favourite place, I thought I could perceive both the “great vulgar, and the Small.” — I should have preferred the Pantheon, but the Subscriptions there are closed; nor do I know what
might

  33
might have been the opinion of my elders concerning it, had they been open. 0\xvpromenade at Ranelagh, in one continued round, I confess I thought but insipid; and considered the gardens there as by no means so extensive as might be wished for in Such a situation.
I had almost forgot to tell you, that we were once (I mean the same trio) at the theatre, to See the last new comedy. The performance was pleasing
; but the house being crowded,
>
we found it disagreeably hot; inso much that I was near fainting, when a young gentleman showing Some assiduities to relieve me, my uncle having remarked it, hurried away the moment the curtain fell, not
B 5 wait
34
waiting to See the entertainment. — Now this behaviour rather Serving to attract notice, makes me suspedl that the Same youth, who likewise prepared then to depart, was disposed to gain Sarther information concerning us; and I was confirmed in this opinion by observing a Servant, in a very Smart livery, endeavouring to keep up with our carriage, which did not
drive fast, as' that is what the old
0 %
gentleman abominates, and what, in the streets of London, his niece does not much approve. However this matter was, I suppose we have done with the theatre, though I am warranted by authority in declaring, dramatic pieces often furnish a rational entertainment. Thus far, I believe,
%
  35
Keve, my guardian and your mother are agreed; I could wish they were So ill many other maxims..
You were lately at the great city,. Caroline, (the winter before last, as I think), but, if I remember right, it had not many charms for you. For my own part, I can recollect: that it
highly delighted me when I was quite a child. — The hurry, the importance, the mixture of business and pleasure that keep all in perpetual motion in this beehive, form a tout -- etifemble^ that, to me, is very engaging. Thus do we differ in taste, and yet, by some means, our minds form an unison.
a propos t my Dear — When you are next in one of your philosophic

36
. moods, will you oblige me with your opinion, how far a Jimilarity of dis pofitions is necessary to cement Love or Friendship? It is a point too deep for me to decide; but I should be very glad to have it determined And notwithstanding what is Said upon the Subject, I don't think Greybeards are always the most competent to judge upon Such questions, of which they are apt, peremptorily enough, to undertake the decision. Perhaps, too, in this very opinion I may differ from my friend, whom I never yet entertained a thought of
stattering, whilst I wished to copy

CHARLES BASIL, ESQ TO THE HON.
HENRY MERTON.
Bath, June the ift.
The kindness which you express
for me, my dear Sir, and the Services So frequently accompanying Such expression, are Such as cannot but make a lasting impression on a mind fusceptible of gratitude, as, I trust, you will always find mine to be. Yet, I confess, when I think on the stender prospect I have of ever returning any of those numerous obligations
  39
ligations that you have conferred on me, at the Same time that I confider the confined situation in which you are at present, I am ashamed to be So much a debtor, and So much a bankrupt in everything, but my good wishes to one So well deserving. Committed So young to the wide
world, and left by him to whom I
*
Should have looked up for assistance, to Seek my fortune where I could find it; with finances too trifling to be mentioned; without present friends or future dependance; — with a Spirit too proud to be Servile; a disposition,
perhaps, not flexible enough to go
♦
through life with advantage to myself, by contributing to the pleasure of others, I had little to expecst from
the
40
»
the aflistance of those whom I remembered among my acquaintance. I shall never forget, that Such was my situation, when first I formed a friendly connexion with you, who did not, like the many, fly from my wants, but, with equal freedom, imparted your advice and assistance.
From the moment I Saw you, I thought I perceived that in your dis pofition which gave me the rational expectation of your being one, from whom a generous Spirit might with honour receive an obligation. — My Subsequent distressed condition at B —, (which put me in mind oi the unhappy Mr. savage’s last stage] and your well timed aid confirmed me in the propriety of that opinion.
Yes!
/
  4i
Yes I you restored me to hope, whilst an unnatural relation would have been glad to hear that I was buried in defliair — It was then first I ventured to call you Friend; to how few can we with propriety give that appellation!
But to proceed with what you are kindly Solicitous in inquiring: — The whole time I Spent in London was about three months; in the course
of which, I complied with your advice, and commenced a Suit at law against the person who, with Such cruelty and contempt, denied my just demand, and wished to shelter himself by legal equivocation. But matters Seem far from coming to an istue. This man is determined to stand it
out
42 T H E T R I U M P H S
out to the last. He is Said to be Sup ported j and I guess from what quarter. I doubt not, however, but th laws of my country will do an in jured individual right, in Spite C chicanery and opprelilon.
When I was in town I my bra there, by chance, at the play: he wa feted in one of the iide boses: a sight of me he changed colour. W took no larther notice of each other sent perceiving my prefece embat' rafied him, I withdrew before th
t
perfijrmance was ever, pitying th' conihion to which a, coafeiotifed of guilt reduces a man, and the paii it earn mcke him fel m the midst C health and aiisueace. Let me,
I to mytelf be unhappy, if Ifevet
wills
  43
wills, but let me not be guilty and at that moment I examined my own heart, to prove whether any latent principle of Envy or Revenge was harboured there; in order, if So, to endeavour to expel such an improper companion for innocence from my b olbm* Revenge, even witlxout considering it as an ofifence to Christianity, is a continual felf torment, and Envy a base passion: indeed, why stioum I envy one who,. I am astiired^ can never enjoy the ** hearfs calm lunihine, ’'* which tliofe who experience must allow to overballance every other earthly Mesting As to the pleafttres I enjoyed in London, they were few d end: avoured to choose Such as I deemed rational ^
but
44
but there was one, the want of whici I regretted, the presence of the onl} man in whom I can repose the con. fidence of friendship— — is true I lei few opportunities pass of enjoying the Social hour with the best acquaintance I could find; but I will own freely, whether from a real oi supposed knowledge of the world, ai it is called, I was almost afraid to examine any farther than the super
ficlal appearance and profeshons oj
my companions, lest I might have found Something to allay the temporary enjoyment, and thus should have been disagreeably compelled to acknowledge, that “happiness is bul
opinion.”
With
I
  45
With regard to Taste, the fashions, and the variety of bagatelles that engage the modisti world, they appear
to move on in the usual round. There
\
is a kind of routiney that no doubt, my dear Sir, you have observed, by which these matters are calculated to involve themselves. As one bubble breaks, another rises: thus they’’ go on, like wave impelling wave; and thus, perhaps, it is necessary that they Should; but yet I would wisti always to keep a steerage, rather than r
I
to be carried away by the stream of dissipation.
As the Peace has returned upon our hands a great number of those, formerly So useful in fighting the battles of this country, I conceive it would
conduce
46
conduce both to the honour of Gt vernment and the advantage of tl country, to procure them emploi mentor otherwise to provide S them.
What led me into this refiedic was, that in the course of my pe: ambulations, I met with a Sailor, 1 native of Wales) who told me a p teous tale of his being pressed at tl beginning of the war, upon informi tion, and the consequent distreffes i which, it Seems, his wife and a your infant were reduced, both of whoi died during his absence, in the worl house. He added, a very comme complaint — indeed too common of the delay of a payment in n fjied: of a small Sum of prize mont
di
  47
due to him. He Said he was not bred to any trade, but had Saved a little money in Service, and had put his wife into a retale business, of a nature in which he could occasionally be useful( ( it at his option to resume his former mode of getting his livelihood) had not this circumstance happened to him. The
man was not wounded, nor any way so disabled as to la claim to a pension; but, through sickness and want, was brought to a state that had reduced him almost to a skeleton. Yet, having a spirit which caused him to
scorn the idea of asking alms while, there was yet the smallest poifibility of finding any other means of fub fistance, he barely existed by carrying
out
48
out Small parcels; not having pro; requisites to enter into Service, as Said, with any degree of decency propriety.
Accustomed to calamities, I stioi be unfeeling indeed is I knew i how to pity every child of misfi tune, — Finding the man Senfib and deeming him worthy of relief gave him a Small matter, and ordei
him to come to me at a certain tin
/
I was then in want of an attenda therefore having inquired into Soi particulars that he had commui cated, I found them true, and mi him an offer of entering into my S vice, which he readily accepted. Thus, I believe, I have in Some C gree administered to the necestit
  4^

TTERE I am, my dear Eliza, X JL happy as the worthy propri

of my friend’s presence, as well that of my parent, who would n venture even upon So short a journe and was not urgently pressed for fe of a return of her indisposition.
Mir
%
  57
Mirth and hospitality are here unbounded, insomuch that I may well say ** this is pleasures golden reign.’" — And yet we are told that it is nothing to what it would be if Lord
Mountfort were here, who was sent
*.
but it is apprehended will not arrive early enough to honour the scene of festivity with his presence.
Though no less than thirty days iare to be pasted thus, only six of which are yet expired, yet every one promises Something new. Something extraordinary; at the same time that Splendour seems united with a graceful elegance and economy; ’ and, hand in hand, they contribute to charm the visitors at this delightful
mansion.

The house is situate on a rilini ground, commanding an extensiv view of the country over fields, lawns and distant groves; and fheltere
4
from the north wind by a thid
wood, which has an appearance f romantic, that it might Seem the Sea of the Britisti Druids. At some distance is Seen the soft flowing Avon whose stiver streams glitter on th day when the fun gilds the landscap round. A variety of gentlemen Seats, as well as many villages, plea Santly situated, rise in prospect.
The mansion is embellished wit the addition of most beautiful gar
j
dens, where flowers and fruits ai lavished in Such profusion, as if Flor
4
and Pomona Strove here to rival eac
other of
  59
Other. — A park and lawn in the rear, which forms the chief scene of our varied diversions, are bounded by an extensive tratst of meadow ground and corn fields, all being a part of the estate of Lord Bellgrove, a pleasing prospect at this time, and in the highest culture.
My pen cannot do justice to the description of the various pleasures which the generous owner provides for the entertainment of his guests.
— This continued festival was introduced by an eulogium on matrimony, at the recital of which I
X
was not present; but I find it will be concluded by the same. Music forms a principal part of our entertainment, for which purpose we have here some
C 6 of
I
6o
X
of the best performer; and lest Select company, however agreeabl Should prescnt too much of Samenel the Splendid managers of our ann verfary call in the country to the aid. It is delightful to see how tl
I
fustics are formed into bands, to er tertain at once themselves and \ with their dances and various sport This is Nature, and not a bare im: ration of her by the power of art.
Such parts of the Scene, to me, ai
/
always the most engaging.
Though six days, as I have Sait are expired, yet our company conti nues to increase. Among the res Mr. Merton, the Son of a worth Peer, of whose name you ha heard frequent mention, is Soon es
pecte
or   6l
pected to grace our amusements with
j
his presence. He has promised to bring Some acquaintance with him, but has hitherto delayed his visit, as I have been told in confidence, in order to have the opportunity of introducing a particular friend of his, a young gentleman, in whose praises he is loud, to the assfembly. Lady Bellgrove says this youth is a phce nomenon. — Her Lady Ship has Seen him more than once, and knows Some who have been intimate with
t
him. According to this lady’s account, there is Something remarkable in his history. Persecuted by a brother, he has been exposed to many hardships in life, and, poffested as he is of Spirit, and all the feelings
of
62
of delicacy, he has the mortificatic of enjoying only a precarious fubfis ance; but is So well armed with pj tience and fortitude, that he appea equal to Sustain almost any affliction My friend is always jocose wit me when she introduces the fubjc' of Love, which, however, she wi permit me to observe is rather a ft rious matter. — In evidence, I ma cite her own question, which applh both to love and friendship— — sha certainly never be ambitious to ol tain the denomination of a femal philosopher. I will, therefore, onl answer in a plain way, that a fimi larity as to ejfentials, ought certaini in either cafe to Subsist, in order t form an unison of souls between th, person
  63
persons So connected; but we see many matters of Smaller moment, in which they may, perhaps, even hap"
pily differ; the variety, like that of the Several notes we find in a musical piece, contributing to the harmony of the composttion. Yet as there, though those notes are different, they must not jar; So neither can true love, or friendship, as I take it, Subsist between those of jarring dispositions— —
conclusion, let me affure you,
t
my Dear, that I am very willing to think myself happy, or, in other words, dilpofed to be pleased on this agreeable Spot, and particularly, as I
find all around me disposed to render
me

rr^he Scene still continues; and
what has put Lord Bell grove and his Lady into higher Spirits than ever, is their having received letters from the young Lord Mountfort, now at Lyons, informing them he is making all expedition to England; So that in a short time he may be expected amongst us; if nothing un foreseen prevents, — We have a Sort of
original
\
66
original character, a poet, here, wl has undertaken to compose an ode C the occasion. He appears to ha’ genius and wit, but posteffes mar particularities, to which is general ascribed his ill success in life. IV Lord says, it is Surprising that heh favoured him So far as to make { offer of this nature, particularly b(
cause there is not anything he sea more than to be accounted a flattere If Fame says true, it will not be ea for him to flatter much upon th occasion, as Lord Mountfort bea the character of being one of the bt and most accomplished young nobl< men of the age. But I must bret off for the present. Here is mo
compan
  67
company, and my presence is requested. — So a Short adieu.
Prepare to hear Something that you will wonder at, my Dear, though there is no miracle; nothing out of the common order of events, in the matter. — It is briefly this. The Honourable Mr. Merton is arrived, and has brought with him Some friends as he promised, among whom is the identical young gentleman, concerning whom you rallied me in your last letter — the youth we Saw at Bristol, whom we remarked to have Something equally amiable and dejected in his appearance. He is now
Some
68
Somewhat more lively; or he think it necessary at least to appear so, a Such a time, and mixing with Sucl an astembly. He was introduced b; the name of Basil. If I don’t mil take, Eliza, his brother is a Barone
of great estate in Warwickshire,
\
man of much felfishnefs, and an ima

pcrious dilpofition, the contrary C which qualities seem conspicuous i; this his relation. — Within an hou after the arrival of these gentleme; and two ladies, a fresh company wa announced. They consisted of ga; young men. Such as in the days o Romance, we might have supposei to break a lance in honour of the la dies at the festival. The leader o this train was Mr. Holton, brother o
th
  69
the Earl of -- -, of whose character
I am ignorant; but he appears willing enough to bring himself acquainted with all here, and promises to be the life of the company; yet I think I have seen those whose levities were more agreeable; but I did not come hither to criticise on any whose presence in the idea of the noble owners of the mansion can be thought to contribute to embellish the entertainment.
His Lordship has just taken Mr. Merton aside, begging the excuse of the company, as he has Something particular to communicate. Probably it may relate to his friend Mr. Basil, on whom the eyes of Some present were turned, (I will not say with
what
J
what propriety) upon the occasion, They are gone far towards the ver of though park, in deep converfatio: and will hardly return to the law in time to be present at a dance < nymphs and shepherds, and a litt musical piece, which are to conclut the rural entertainments of the day.
The Earl returns without M Merton, with whose excuses for Short absence he has charged himsel — The musical piece is over, and the begin to assemble in the fupper roon Mr. Merton having not yet joined u; Surely, it must be matter of urger business that removes a person froi the company so Soon after his arriva — The common forms of ceremon have taken me frequently off fror

V
endeavours to be distinguished by him; and I am much deceived if this does not excite envy among Some of the gentlemen. Mr. Holton, in particular. Seems to entertain a jea lousy of this sort, though he strives to hide it under a veil of respect and politeness. But the evil passions in the human mind will often disturb the greatest apparent felicity.
Mr. Merton, who returned just in time for our evening repast, as I thought, with care on his brow, the night I wrote last to you, appears to have cleared up his countenance,
while his friend preserves an equality
/
of temper, which, however, seems

t
mind; but indeed So many enjoy ments courting us here, “Sadnel were a fin,"’ and Mr. Basil appear
I
to be one that, whatever is his ow
/
, situation, wishes to contribute to th pleasure of others.
I shall not repeat that you are mad girl, Eliza,; but I shall obferv you have properly determined to full pend your judgement concerning an
thing that relates to him whom yo
#
have given me for a lover. Indeed do not recollect that Mr. Basil V a
very particular with me when fir:
we saw him at B -- -- --. I am sure h
does not appear at all so here.
- am rather more distinguished by th
youn

young heir of Bellgrove; tho’ really I take this to be only a high strain of gallantry. Seeing me, as I am, almost the only female standing, as it were, alone, except what I owe to the countenance of his parents, in this great company. But it was a singularity of my mother's, (herself not venturing to accompany me) not to
put me under the escort or care of
«
any other, except Lord and Lady Bellgrove, to whom, by letter. She most affectionately recommended me.
Without dissimulation, Eliza, I cannot help thinking that you, or any person possessed of feelings, might well experience a ** touch of the condition” of Such a worthy youth as Mr.
Basil.
. /

Basil is supposed to be, deserted, ar even persecuted by a near relation and Love out of the question. — t1
face of his present affairs is probab
/
such, on his fide, as to leave litt room in his bosom for'the tendit

passion; and for me to give way
V
a disposition of this kind must be weakness indeed; such an one as think my friend would hardly fi into.
I commend your conduct relati to your anonymous gallant; perhaj as you Seem apprehensive, I ought n so much to commend the Severi with which you treat certain persor the motives of whose conduct ma perhaps, plead Some excuse for the i conveniences refiilting to you fro

  89
it. Besides, it is but reasonable to allow Something to Age and Temper. At least, my Eliza is not So unhappy as to have Persecutors to deal with; in that there is Some comfort j and it is known that your relations, however suspicious you have reason to conceive they are of your conduct, speak of you in the highest terms. Your aunt has been heard to say you were a jewel: can you wonder the old lady should strive that such a jewel might not be in danger of having its lustre tarnished? It were to be wished, my friend would Sometimes confider matters in this light, as she ought not to be in sensible to her own worth, of which Nature and circumstances have contributed

That all restraint is disagreeabl nobody can Seriousty deny, yet, in degree, it must be Submitted to, every station of life; and I am coi iident, if none were imposed on y by your kindred, you would be testimony to the truth of this, 1 putting Some on yourself. What a many of the articles of decorum universally Subscribed to by our Southeast but as many restraints; yet how po a figure Should we cut without then At this time, my Dear, I am not co tending with impetuous passions, tl: often prove too strong for our fr;
nature; I am only reminding yo as, I believe, in your coolest hours

refiedtion, since I believe my letters are read when you are alone, and are consequently observed, if they contain anything that is worthy of attention.

arrival at Bellgrove place has not had the effect of making me forget any of my absent friends. I need not tell you, Frank,
I
that I account you of the number. All is happiness and gaiety here, and in order to make myself welcome, I was not backward in bringing with me Some who were ready to join the

the company, in consequence of tha obligation.
There have been a matrimonial Eu logium, and an Ode recited here; th jirft I have not heard; but it is to b repeated; the lafi^ composed in honou

It is most likely you disappointed the lady, who had Some pretty story to tell you if you had insisted on knowing the contents, which, it may be reasonably supposed, were framed to answer Some particular purpose— — did not Speak out So freely before, because I thought it would be useless, till you had Some fair cause to awaken Suspicion in your breast. — Now that is surely the cafe, perhaps you will listen to a friend. — Prove her, try her to the utmost before you accept her as a mistress, for surely you cannot think of her in any other
light:

those pretenders to virtue who are endued with many vices. This young

the relation of a brother to a Baronet, with whom (having offended him by ’ Some misbehaviour) he is in disgrace. And therefore he is considered by fomeas a living martyr to the other’s
f
persecutions. 'But as no cause is assigned for this condud, on the part of the complainant, I think the wise part of the world may safely conclude him to be in the wrong. His presence here is owing to Something like a self invitation — a friend of his has introduced, or intruded him upon us.
He appears to be much respected by Lord Bellgrove, and takes Some pains to get into the good graces of the

After affording me every afiistance in your power, I have, to acknowledge your recommendation of me
tocapt. T -- -- family, in quality
of companion to his lady.
For Some time, all things went
on well there. Mrs. T -- -- was as
kind a lady as could be imagined, and I had every reason to think that I should live happy in my station.
1
It was not long, however, before I perceived Such dispositions as were likely to Sow the seeds of discord
there. Capt. T -- -- was addidtcd to
roving, and his wife gave herself up to jealousy; all which, however, I
I
conceived would not afihdt me, and consequently gave me no other concern, than iuch as Sometimes resulted
from.
Il
from being an involuntary witness the anxieties in which it invoh them.
But, I had not been thus Situat above two months, before I observ the Captain took'particular notice me, whenever he could find me alor A distant respedt was the return made, which kept him aloof for Son time; but as he was one of the men whom difficulties do not daui in their pursuits, neither this beh: viour, nor my afterwards Shunnin his presence, in a studied man:; had the desired effect. He followe me wherever he found an opportunity, and besides attempted to tak liberties with me, that consciou modesty, and the regard which
owe(
  II
owed myself and my situation, occasioned me, in Some measure, to rc sent. Piqued at this behaviour, the
gentleman had, for Some time, left
/
off troubling me. But,, when I thought I Should be entirely rid of this embaraffment, and concluded that his good Sense had Shown him the impropriety of his conduct, I was Surprised, on entering a room that led towards my lady’s chamber, to See him Suddenly standing at my fide. — I would have withdrawn, but
f
he prevented me. Saying, Amelia, I must insist on your staying a mo“ “for I have Something of a “Serious nature to propose for your

After many compliments paid my person, he introduced a prope of keeping me as a mistress, or
I
stipend of 200i. per annum, at place some miles .distant from 1 town, where he could visit me t castonally. He insisted on my he: ing a recital of the plan he 1: formed for this purpose. I did with reluctance, and in answer t( him, I was sorry he had spent 1 time to so little purpose, in frami a design that could never be put execution.

’ %
affected a Smile of contempt at Such
preaddingy as he termed it, and Slid I was a fool to refuse a good offer, which I should hereafter wish I had accepted. But, finding his words had no weight with me, he withdrew; and I once more fancied I had Sebn and heard the end of his importunities- -- -- -
the Captain was thus pur

A circumstance of this sort would rouse them to espouse my cause, and ** show the false and haughty man ** what an injured wife can accom. plisti.’^
F 2 Displeased
124
displeased as I had been with tl captain’s infamous proposals, yet was glad his lady’s fuspicions read ed no farther than I conceived the did by her speech; since the latter en of it pointed out to me how imprc per it would be to place the con fidence in her that She required, ^ it was likely to turn out to her ow unhappiness, and to blow the coal of contention In the family.
. For sometime my married love forbore his troublesome addreffej and as I really thought, Seemed t treat me with Somewhat borderin] on contempt, which in that onl instance would have proved agree able. But he was such a master of ar tifice, that it was quite easy for him t(
dcceiv'
  12^
deceive one of a temper open as mine, and who possessed So little experience.
About a month had elapsed, whenas you may remember, their family went to reside for a few weeks at
-- -- -- -- -, and, in consequence, I also
went with them. Here I began to
V
think domestic peace was reestablished, because he and his Lady appeared more cordial to each other, and as I had not observed any Symptoms of ill nature, on the one hand, nor of jealousy on the other, since
N
our removal. In the mean time we

kept but little company, and the house, with its appendages, formed •an agreeable rural retirement.

I fear this will be the cafe wi my present situation, as I think I d cover Some traits in the family whi by no means answer the idea I entt tained when I came among them a lodger.
In the course of a conversation had two days since with Mrs. Crofb I was surprised at hearing her avc Some principles which I deem as i;
\
consistent with virtue as once
thought them to be with her dispi
%
fition.
At the same time I do not great like the behaviour of my fello lodger, who begins to betray an equ freedom (as (lie is pleased to call i

The company fly Saw last night at a late hour disgusted me; and my dis gust was heightened by the answers fire made to the raillery pajffed upon her by miss Croshy, whose gravity I find to be all affected. I begin to apprehend I am Sallen into a very indifferent house indeed.
For Some time past, they have
»
given me an old Baronet for a lover, and urge me to pass the time away with his courtship: He was introduced as a singular character; but I
#
'know not whether there is not Some
\
affectation likewise in this gentle man, who has been often endeavour ing to force upon me much more than the worth of my work, in Some arg

tides that I have executed for him but in this he always met with 1 steady refusal.
There is a matter of another na ture, which likewise, in some degree Surprises me. This morning Mrs Croshy desired, if it was convenient that I would settle with her, 01 which I readily offered her the ren of the rooms. “Miss Emily, thi is for lodging, '' said she, as. thought, laying a strong emphasis 01 the last word. — “Yes, Madam, ’ answered I, and I know not tha “there is anything elfe due; i “there is, it has really escaped nr remembrance.'’ — “Oh yes! bu there is, child, ” cried she, clap
pii
  i49
ping her hand on my neck, with a coarse Samiliarity, ‘‘ and I dare Say I “Shall make you Sensible of it before we part.” I thought She spoke this Seriaufiy; I had reason to think So; but when I urged her Serioufiy on the matter, she turned it off with a
I
laugh, and Said she only meant I owed her good will — I wish she may only owe me the fame: But it Seemed rather remarkable that though this woman desired I would Settle with her, yet she went down without the money. Saying she would not take it just now, as she did not want it; but that she liked to try how ready folks would be to pay, in cafe she had occasion to require it. Her
G 3 daughter,
»
150
daughter, the other lodger, and the Servant, were all present. IS this is trtjiingi it is too egregious, to be entertained with; if it is noty what in the name of goodness can be meant by it ^
Since that, she would have me dine with her and her daughter. The discourfe turned chiefly on the Baronet, on whom, notwithstanding stie pretended to ridicule his whimsical
dispofition, she contrived to pass several eulogiums; adding, That
he had so much money he Scarcely knew the end of his riches; and with all his oddities, was a sincere and codstaut friend wherever he formed an attachment, ” She told
Some
/
(
  151
Some stories likewise of his gallantry, and Seemed rather disappointed that I was not highly entertained by them.
Vfhile we were discoursing. Sir George entered, as it was probably designed he Should j and I was not Suffered to withdraw. He did not behave in So odd a manner as ushal, which Served only to strengthen me in the opinion that much of this singularity was assumed; what followed put the matter beyond a doubt; for Mrs. Croshy and her daughter leaving the room on various pretences, he no Sooner found himself alone
V
with me than he began to discourse in a very Serious manner, and related
G 4 how
4
152
how unhappy he had been in marriage, thanking Heaven that death had released him from a woman who was a plague to him, to herself, and to all about her. — After such experi rience, he protested he would never again enter into the marriage state,
t
but if he could get a fair friend and constant companion to astbciate with, he would maintain her in affluence, and treat her with all the respect and tenderness her heart could wish. — From the manner in which all this was delivered, it was evident for whom the bait was thrown out: but I would not appear to understand the drift of it, till the Baronet brought
it So close as, to intimate that Such a

pursuant to my intention, I had but just dispatched my last to you when I gave Mrs. Croshy warning, in presence of her other lodger. — I could perceive (he was So much vexed, that it was with difficulty She restrained her rising passion. She asked what I had to find fault with in her house, and before I could return an answer, this, her cousin, as she is called, began an harangue in praise of the accommodations. Unwilling to enter into any altercations, I only Said that I found it necessary to change my situation, in which, being but a weekly lodger, I thought I might use my pleasure without giving her any just cause of offence— —?

From this time, I reshlved to keep myself as recluse from company as I could during my Short stay in the house. I thought the landlady had Spoken pretty plainly, and, indeed, I would willingly have Shortened that period, but that I feared a quarrel with Such people, in my lone

any Such thing, and she was’affured

“her mother would not; that I “might deliver my refusal myself, when next I Saw Sir George, if I ** continued in that mind; and as “to the favour I mentioned, I must “be very imprudent indeed if I did not keep that, to answer my northeast“ “— She then went hastily out of the room, observing, ** that “there was a great fufs made by

she knew by what his Servant Said, “was just then gone a little way out of town, I should have an oppor “tunity of feeing and telling him

The condescension to argue a cir
m
cumstance of this sort, the bare supposition that I could consent, were matters at which strict delicacy ought to be offended; but prudence Suggested to me that in my present situation, these things ought rather, to work silently as stimulators to urge my quitting such an habitation.
I had looked out for lodgings; but as yet had found none to Suit me;
and
164
and I now first began to be apprehensive that a charader from Mrs. Croshy would be a very Slight recommendation of me to any reputa table house. This reflection increased my anxiety — Good Heavens! to what perplexities is a young female driven, who stands like me, alone and unfriended in the wide world. — To this I owe that I am in my present situation: : — to proceed.
The next day I again went out in Search of an apartment, and actually found the difficulty I apprehended; for, after agreeing for a Suitable one,. “the mistress of the house demanding to know my last place of abode, having mentioned Mrs. croshy’s, I
perceived
V
  165
perceived that she started Several difficulties, and I was disappointed of my lodging.
When I came home, full of vexation, I found Mrs. Croshy and her daughter in high Spirits — They had a young gentleman with them, whom they reported to be her coufin’s Sweetheart : They were all enjoying them selves over a bowl of punch; and were very Solicitous with me to partake of the liquor; but finding all their entreaties vain, Mrs. Croshy confined herself only to urging me to drink coffee with them. I fuf sered myself at last to be prevailed on So far by their entreaties, in which the young gentleman joined, who
Seemed,
4
l66
Seemed, by his conversation, to be a person of sense, and fit for better company. He appeared very attentive to me; and by that attention, as I thought, displeased Mrs. Croshy and her daughter. He went away very early, having Some buliness in the city, but promised to call again in the evening, to see the young lady at an hour not very proper for visits of Such a kind to single women, who have a character to lose.
I withdrew Soon after, and retiring to my chamber in a state of mind which was very disagreeable. I meant to go early to rest, and to pafs the intervening period of time in reading. Accordingly I went to a
closet,

in a corner. — I Shrieked: He came Sorward and bade me be pacified, crying, “It is I! the man of all “the world that adores you.” It was Sir George; ‘‘ base as you are,
(I exclaimed) and a dishonour to your rank, what do you here, what “would you have with one who
disdains you and your infamous “proposals? Begone, or I will raise“ “neighbourhood.” — He made

MISS AMELIA AVERY TO THE SAME,
IN CONTINUATION.
I
IN the midst of the confusion occa stoned by this affair, which! as sure you. Madam, had almost deprived me of my faculties, by the time my exertions Substded, the youth who had been announced as the lover of Mrs. croshy’s coustn, entered the
room. When the eclairciffment I
■ •
have Spoken of, took place, he ex
H 2 claimed.
fjl
claimed, What a Scene of villain is this, ” and going up to the Ba ronet, told him, it was his age onl that protected him from an immediate
chastisement, But, ” add he, “I hope and believe there ai ways left, for this injured Innocer to punish, or compel you to foni ‘‘ recompense. It is clear this wi “intended only as a piece of reveng for having slighted you and yoi “offers. Are you not ashamed < “such behaviour? But get henc “and reflect at home, with what St “tisfaction you can, upon the injui you meant to do a defenceless f male. Your stay here must: 1 Shameful to yourself, as the Sigl

** of you is hateful to all worthy “persons present.’"
Covered as he was with confusion, the Baronet needed no Second admonition to be gone. He went off, not without the hisses of most present, yet Seemingly Satisfied in Some measure at having regained his ^50 note, which, contrary to the persuafion of the neighbours, I restored him.
The young gentleman failed not to upbraid Mrs. Croshy for the part
that I truly declared She had born in
• ^
this wicked plot, and exhorted me to quit the lodging dire(5l: ly. She replied, I might pay her for what I owed her for board and lodging, and go as Soon as I pleased, as She did not want my company, to breed disturb
H 3 anceg
174 the triumphs
^ \
ances in her house. — When I afkcc
I
what I owed her, I found She hac run the demand up to a confiderablt Sum; for this good woman had charged me for my diet ever Since I had been under her roof, though I never partook of a meal with her, without paying diredfly, except three or four times on her invitation. Yet when I disputed this, She had her daughter and the Servant ready
to confirm what she asserted; and as
»
I had reason to think they would have done the same in a Court of
j
Justice, (Such vas their apparent effrontery) I complied with the demand, having recovered Spirits
enough to tell Mrs. Croshy, that the
\
overcharge I looked on, as a tribute
which I
  i75
f
which I gladly paid, to get rid of all connexions with Such an infamous
person,
, ** is well judged, ” Said the young gentleman, ** and permit me, “Madam, to lead you out of this den of iniquity. I will escort you “whither you please, in safety.” Thus Situate, I Suffered him to lead me out of the house, happy to turn my back of it, after receiving my landlady's promise that I should have what things I left there, on Sending for them the next morning.
It was now past ten o'clock; and on my condudor's afkihg me to what place I chose to repair, J was confounded, and could only make
the late hour an excuse for my not
H 4 knowing
jy6
knowing whom I Should trouble on the occasion.
ft
At the Same time I could not be very easy dn this Situation, when I considered myself alone, at Such a time, with a stranger, who might only have taken my part against Mrs. Croshy and the Baronet, with
a view to draw me into another
%
Snare; yet there was Something So open in his behaviour. So tender in
his manner; and he showed So much readiness in accompanying me to any friend, if I had Such to sty to for shelter, that it Seemed ungenerous to suspedl him.
He now proposed conducting me to the house of an acquaintance of
his, ‘‘ She is a captain’s widow, ”
Said
>
  i77 '
Said he, a woman of good reputation; but for that you need not
barely rely upon my word, as you may inquire her character in the neighbourhood.’’ I could not well do otherwise than accept this offer, and when we arrived at the place he mentioned, I found myself well received, notwithstanding the extraordinary circumstances attending my introduction.
The character of Mrs. Sibley answered to what this gentleman had told me. His name is Euston; he is a person of some fortune, and greater dependance. Since I have been here, he has treated me in the most respedlful manner, never intruding himself but when he is ash
5 fared
lys
sured he is welcome; nor inquiring farther particulars relative to me, than I chuse to make him acquainted with.
Mr. euston’s visits, however, are pretty regular; yet, as he has never declared himself a lover on honourable terms, foj on the other hand, he
has never shown, either bv his words
%
or adfions, that he has any other designs. In the mean time he in fists on loading me with presents, and infists I should not earn my sub fistanee in the mode I had before adopted, which, he says, would be likely to lay me open to many temptations. The step that I took of first throv/ing miyfelf under the pro tection of this young gentleman,
whom
/
  i79
whom chance put in my way, I may well justify by necessity; yet,
perhaps, the propriety of my continuing thus under perpetual obligations to one to whom I cannot tell
/
how to make any return, will not admit of being considered in the same point of view. All I can learn from Mrs. Sibley is, that Mr. Euston never speaks of me but with the highest regard, and that he seems rather jealous of my feeing any other com pany.
I find his acquaintance at Mrs. croshy’s was slight indeed: having only followed her cousin home from the play the night before I fiw him; her forwardness gave occasion to the visits I mentioned, at the latter of
H 6 which
\

which, he Saw enough to disgust him with the family.
If ever I have any friends, it generally happens that they are at a distance when I most need them. Your presence in Town, my dear Madam, might have put my affairs
*
into another train. But now it only remains for me to ask your friendly advice how I Shall model my conduct
at Such a juncture.? — At the same
/
time it may be necessary to mention, that with respect to the situation of my own mind, I have conceived a Sort of grateful esteem for this my
I
benefactor; but, if I know my own heart, it is not tinctured with passion;; that I am not in any danger of being held in thraldom by him
who

who appears to pay me So much attention; neither, isle were to form any dishonourable designs, would he have the chance of being seconded by my weakness, which I believe is too often the cafe with our sex.

of receiving at least the consolation of your correspondence, at a time when your counsel is so necessary to

IT is. true, my dear Eliza, that there is a certain quality in the. mind, ta which we, owe our plea sures, more than to all that pastes round us.: — This I have often experienced. I am aware that many will Say, a distaste of Pleasure, where it reigns,, or. a, taste of it where,

they are marks of infamty..

I Shall not trouble my friend with an attempt at a philosophical disquisition on this matter; but I Shall observe that, within a few days past, I have experienced the reality of what I Set out with as ferting. Within sthese few days, this Paradise of delight has began ^ to lose its charms for me; or if I can find any pleasure in these walks, (which might well Seem the haunts of Sylvan Powers), it is when I retire into the thickest of their shades, and heave involuntary
15 hghs,.
202
sighs, at a distance from the Social Train, where I am .jfiattered that my company is most agreeable.
The idea that a change of this kind forebodes Some evil event, is not singular; but it is Such as, amidst all the weakness of my sex, I never adopted : at the same time, the tranquillity I poffested, a little while since, renders this disposition, which I cannot conceal, the more
remarkable to Such as I would not
a
wisti to notice it.
Among these is Mr. Holton, whom I once thought devoted te Lady Juletta Sabine, but who now Seems very intent (more so' than I could wish) on paying his court to me. I really believe this arises rather

MISS ELIZA ELSE TO MISS CAROLINE
STANMORE.
June ay,
T DO not forget you, my Dear;
and I would not have you forget yourself in any emergency.
The commands of your parents seem, to me, as unreasonable as their determination; and the prof

posals of this upstart lover, were Sudden. Pray what do they know of Mr. Holton, farther than that
'he
2o8 the triumphs
he is styled Honourable on account of the relationship in which he
(
stands to a Peerage, and that he is posteffed of a considerable fortune? I hope these are not the only qualifications necestary for
him who is to be the husband of
*
their daughter and my friend! — Besides he may possess Some bad qualities of which they are ignorant. Surely this is a most preci pitate measure of their’s; and Such
as it is not reasonable to expect
* ^ *
should be as precipitate in adopting.
Without advising you, my ca roline, to adt just as I should do,, on this occasion, I think I need not hesitate to declare my opinion
f
that
  209
that you are justified in demurring -
on a matter concluded So hastily. Apply, in particalar, to your mother, who is certainly a woman of good sense, and capable of hearing reasonable arguments : As you are So well convinced of her affection, endeavour to awaken her parental feelings; and Spare not to tell her how miserable this intended match must make you; — and miserable you will be, for another reason than any you have chosen to insist on.
4
It is not for nothing that my friend has conceived a disrelisti for
4
pleasure; that mirth has lost its charms for her, and that stie retires to Solitude, when stie might
glitter
•y
210 TE
glitter S one of the brightest ornaments of the Social trin at
Bellgrove. No! let me tell my
friend, (since she feenis afraid to acknowledge it to hersels), that She is not So capricious as she would
• ■V'
make herself appear. There is one, doubtless, at Beligrove place, for whom stie heaves involuntary sighs—
— Such are the Symptoms of Love. And if basil is the man, I See np reason why a passion indulged for him, Should fink
f
her in the estimation of any one. To be unfortunate, to be persecuted, we find his lot; but if a man is guilty of no baseness, the Good and Wife will not resped: him the less for being unhappy.
You
  21i
You have urged, my caroiiue> that, however favourably you might
be disposed towards Mr. Basil, he
had made no advances to you Surely you could not Suppose I would recommend you to make any to him: — And you observed, that the situation of his affairs
Seemed Such as afforded no room to entertain the Softer passion but the Heart is a very roomy mansion; and perhaps it is never more calculated to receive Such a tender impression than when it has been already Softened by affliction. Nor can I believe, the person in question is So busy as not to be at leisure to love: I am rather of opinion, that he is not insensible

\
212
fible to the charms of my friend, though he may wait a favourable moment for declaring his Sentiments. I must say, for my own part, it is my opinion, he is the only man you have yet beheld, that can make you happy in the marriage state. — That he viewed
you with eyes of tenderness, when
%
first he Saw you at B -- -- -; and, I
believe, youy Caroline, were of the same opinion. I would, therefore, have you, on all accounts, be steady in refusing to listen to the proposed lover, who thinks he has made his approaches So regular. By this time, however, I may reasonably suppose he has thought
proper to address you in person
•»

  2IJ
m
with all the art he is master of, and not without a confidence inspired by the countenance your parents have determined to afford him. I hope he has met with proper repulse.
My Inamorato continued lending his billets, till I gave him to understand, in the only one he had the honour to receive from me
0
that I Should neither give him a meeting nor an answer, till I had the pleasure of knowing to whom
I was obliged for So much attention. How agreeable this intimation may be, I do not pretend to judge; but if he is sincere and honourable in his professions, I Should think he will not hesitate
longer
214
longer, to discover his name to her on whom, if he is to be believed, he wfillies to bestow it. If he is of another opinion, he must keep his name and his addrestes to himself: That is my resolution; though I will now confess, that if his character and connexions please me as well as bis person, he will not have much to apprehend, from my cruelty, whatever obstacle may be thrown in his way by that of my relations. So, you see, ray Dear, that, contrary to the common mode, I am practising a self-denial, which I do not, just now, preach up to you; and I expect due praise for Such an extraordinary exertion.
I
I entreat
OP   215

CHARLES BASIL, ESQ. TO THE HON
HENRY MERTON.
»
OUR Sudden departure, in the midst of the festivity here, my dear and respected friend, really cast a damp upon the Spirits of most of the company, and are much regretted by the noble Owner of the mansion. With regard to myself, it has left nle almost alone, in leaving me without my introducer. —
  J
ducer: I well remember indeed that you have often checked me, in a friendly manner, for this sort of diffidence; but when my peculiar situations in life are iconfidered, how
I
Seldom have they been Such as could give encouragement to afiume that confidence which accompany afhu enee and independence? — It is true, had I been born in a lower order of life, I might have proceeded in the same line with others, .and with a similar confidence; but the rank
0
which I am expected to hold is So ill
%
answered by the means, and by every circumstance, that all things concur to make me, as it were, a being different from those around me. Per, vol, I. K haps
I X
2i8 the triumphs
haps there is a particularity in my manners which may also contribute to this. However it be, I feel the effect, whilst others guess at the
cause.
»
I stand charged with diffidence also in a matter wherein boldness is generally most likely to ensure success. You are the only person acquainted with the Secret of my passion for that young lady, who came, as you say heaven directed! tobellgrove place. Having an apparent rival in her love — a youth of noble birth and acknowledged accomplishments, I am told ought to stimulate me to bring forward my addresses: but, alas these very reasons, in Some measure,
i form

form an argument against it. For what have I to boast, that in the eyes of the world you Set me on a footing with Lord Mountford, even though my own partiality should lead me to give myself the preference: and further, should I contend, and carry off the prize from my rival, am I not doing an injury to the person I love, at least will not the world, whose censure I have So often experienced, judge and decide in this manner. Nay, what is more, may not the object of my love herself, on cool refiedlion, in after times, be ready to accuse me of a felfishness, which induced me to persuade her to forego her honour and advantage, in order
K 2 to
220
to gratify my wishes? It is not
common, you will say, for lovers to
. ^ *
reason thus; nor could I, were I once to pay addresses to my fair one, to find them favoured by her, and
to indulge what would become a mutual passion. What better then can I do, but at once jtjcr prevent, to stifle, if possible, an inclination which is likely to meet with so many obstacles? If fate indeed should hereafter smile upon me, and Caroline should remain disengaged, I might then, with confidence, declare an honourable love, and expect an honourable reception.
To you, my best of friends, I have thus unbosomed myself, as I
have
*
  221
have not a Sentiment that I desire to conceal from you, nor a circumstance in my life that I could wilh you to be unacquainted with. In the meantime, as all that is dear to you claims my concern, you will not doubt the sincerity with which I express my anxiety for the health of your noble kinsman. The character of Lord Bromley is indeed, of itself Sufficient to make every one regard him; nor can I wonder at the haste with • which you stew to him on receiving the news of his ill ness, which I regret, your absence as well as the occasion.
The conversation of his lordship’s amiable lister, I hope, will in the

K 4 miss
s24
miss Caroline Stanmore is now openly addressed by a lover — not by Charles Basil— — by Lord melsord — but by Mr. Holton, an honourable gentleman, with whom I believe you are not entirely unacquainted.
His Suit, as far as I can learn, is countenanced by her parents, and he has begun to carry it on with Such boldness as if he had hardly a doubt of success j though it does not appear that the lady herself is very partial
in his favour.
IP But, whatever are her Sentiments,
I •*'?'**
IM ' can I wonder at thole which others ' entertain of her charms and accom
plissiments? Can I be at all Surprised that Such an accomplished
female
OF FORT ITU D E. 22^
female should find her lovers multiplied Every day she grows higher in my esteem, whilst every day but removes my hopes of posteshng this trcasure to a greater distance.
You will, perhaps, think it rather
extraordinary, my dear friend, that I should not have exprested the Same concern when Lord Melford was first given as a lover to miss Stanmore, who was one more worthy than he is who at present addrefies her; but you will remember this young nobleman had not declared his love; and that there was a probability of his parents throwing obstacles in his way. On the other hand, Mr. Holton actually proceeds, with the con

226
Sent of Mr. Stanmore, under no restraint from his own relations, and' (if I rightly read his character) with a head capable of framing a thousand artifices, which, if they should not enforce his success, will at lead give her a chance of throwing any rival at a distance. In the height of affluence and independence, he is otherwise poffefied of a gaiety and Spirit which, in the course of frequent conversation, may recommend him to those who at first were quite
indifferent to him. The respect.

the object of my wishes without

even an attempt to make them known, being foiled without engaging in the contest.
At the same time, in order to add to my anxiety, I think there is a perceptible coolness in Lord bellgrove’s behaviour towards me. This is the more extraordinary in the man who so warmly interested himself in my behalf, as we may both well remember, when I first came hither, and
*
who acted in concert with yourself in detecting a calumny which otherwise would Soon have Spread abroad like wild fire, and owed its birth, as I had reason to apprehend, to my good-natured brother.
K 6 I affure
228
I alture you, thus situate, were it not for the charm of caroline’s presence, I should be tempted to leave this place, where, in the midst of surrounding pleasures, I can taste no enjoyment, even before the few remaining days allotted to the period of festivity expires. As it is, I conceive I cannot add to, but must rather dimi — nish from, the mirth of the company, in Spite of all my endeavours to the contrary.
Forced Smiles are not likely to communicate pleasure, and that joy can be but ill depiisted on the countenance which does not arise from the sensations of the heart.
It may be imagined, after what I
have said, that I shall stay no longer
than
  2^
than till the conclusion of our anniversary, notwithstanding a former invitation from his Lordship. When Miss Stanmore departs, every gleam that can brighten this place in my view will be gone. It is probable I stiall repair again to London, on the old disagreeable bufiness. But wherever I am, you may depend on never being forgotten, in the midst of all his embarastments, by
Your sincerest friend, Charles Basil.

THE HON. HENRY MERTON TO CHARLES
BASIL, ESQ.
%
Bromley park, July 2.
'Y' OUR letters, my dear friend,
reached me whilst I was em employed in attending the bed of sickness, and endeavouring, by conversation and all possible assiduities, to allevate the pains of my worthy kinsman, who has Suffered most Severely from a violent fit of the stone.
It
  23i
/
It is indeed the hard lot of mortals
I
to Suffer afflictions in this Sublunary state; and, were we to judge only by appearances, we Should conclude also that the Sufferings of Some exceeded those of others in an immense proportion. But as we cannot decide by externals, only the truth remains enveloped in clouds; and all the afflicted can do is to call fortitude to their aid, as I have always hitherto known you do; and if the afflictions are unmerited, a conscious sense of worth will doubtless help to Sustain them. All this is but repeating what you know already; but there are Some matters of which Sometimes it may not be amiss that we Should be reminded.
If
2^2
If I blamed you, my dear friend, either for diffidence or Seeming rev

miffness in what concerned you nearest, it was only with the hope of stirring you up to those exertions of which you ire capable. I cannat be insensible to the difficulties you have to encounter, yet I conceive the fweetness of your manners, and the accomplishments which (I may say without flattery) you poflfess, are Such as may win the heart of a female of miss stanmore’s difpolition. Indeed I have thought that lady Sometimes stole Some glances at you, which Seemed to indicate that you were agreeable in her eyes. As to Lord
V
Mountford, his gallantry and general
tender
V
  233
tenderness to the Sex is Such, that I doubted whether to rank him as a lover of that lady, to whom he possibly showed a marked attention, as being under the immediate protection of his parents, who, however, as you Seem yourself to be Sensible, would not be likely to approve her for a daughter in law. If the Earl of Bellgrove has a foible, it is that of paying rather too much respedt to titles and nobility; where he finds them, it is most likely he will Seek
t
family alliances.
Though it is Sudden, and appears a little extraordinary, that holws^n i should declare himself a lover of miss Stanmore, and, by a sort of manoeuvre, poltefs himself of the consent of
her
234
her parents, wha, as I believe, know. but little of him; yet his rival Ship may not be So dangerous as you imagine. If I have formed a just idea of the person he addrestes, his Suit will be disagreeable to her; and perhaps
it may appear that her father and mother were surprised into a consent, and urged to lay commands on their child, which they will not insist on her implicitly obeying, if they are assured that in So doing they will render her unhappy.
A Short time will probably enable you to form Some judgement of the event; in the meanwhile, I Should fuppose you were better Situate for observing what pastes at Bellgrove place than at London. As to his
lordship’s
  235
#
lordship’s coolness, I am really apt to think that exists only in your imagination; for a man of that openness, which he gave proofs of at your first arrival, would, I think be plain enough to tell you if he had seen or heard anything to fink you in his opinion. I hope therefore you will, on refiedlion, revoke your resolution of departing at the end of the festival; at least if that worthy nobleman renews his invitation.
I have the happiness to tell you that my kinsman has greatly recovered. I present you with his remembrances, and those of lady Mary, and Subscribe myself, yours as ever,
Henry Merton.

HP HE festivity is at an end, my

they

they would follow all those who are connected with him, or have a concern in his welfare.
It was but yesterday that I received a letter, the first I ever had, and per haps the last that I stiall ever have from him. In this he profestes an unalterable attachment to me, and in the same line tells me, he must remove from Bellgrove place, and from my presence;; he is going he knows not whither; and says, he is almost tempted to renounce all concern for humankind, except myself and one valued friend, whom I fupposc to be Mr. Merton.
At Such a juncture, and with such a disposition of mind, how uselefs
was

Ah! hopeless, lading flames, like those which burn To light the dead, and warm th’unfiniflied urni
But this is not all; to fill up the measure of my vexation, I hear it whispered from one to another, that Charles Basil is a hypocrite and a villain. Is he a villain? if he is, he must indeed be a hypocrite; and if he is, then he is the first, I believe, who ever exhibited a countenance So open, a manner So unaffedfed, and a carriage So void of constraint. But I

must not appear to favour him. — Capricious fortune! In what em barrastments am I about to be involved?
• Here is Holton continually at my fide; Sometimes affectedly at my feet, teasing me with his pastion, to which, without being truly a hypocrite, I cannot make any other return than indifference. In the mean time, repeated letters from home press me to favour his addresses. My mother, in particular, on whose affections you advise me to court, commands, I should rather say that indulgent parent intreats, me to encourage this upstart lover. Then am I commanded, entreated, to

I must seek the mediation of some friend to prevent it, and re concile me to my parents. Suppose I Should apply to Lord Bellgrove! — Yet he has almost lost my confidence;

that this disgraceful account of my Charles originates. My Charles did I Say! — But from you, Eliza, I can conceal nothing. I now find that he is dear to me: — yet what an expression! — he never will be mine; — fate will place insuperable obstacles between us.

was left for him by the Earl of Belli

now entirely detached his Lordship

disorder; and I congratulate you on the return of health and spirits, as

forming the greatest blesting that mortals can enjoy below.
In the midst of your indispofition, my noble friend, it was, at least, your happiness to receive from a lister and a kinsman that attention which Soothes the languid heart, and contributes to make less tedious the dis confolate hour. The loss of a beloved wife, and of a child on whom my fond hopes had been placed, were among the afflidlions I experienced before I attained the meridian of life : — At a period wheii the ardent passions of youth Subfide, and gaudy pleasures begin to fade in our eyes, the dear relation of kindred ties and
family affections stiould form the
%
greater part of our happiness.
You
/
  g
You are well acquainted, my Lord, that I had but one object to whom I wished to transfer these affections— — brother’s Son; a youth of promising talents, and, as I had reason to suppose, endowed with the seeds of many virtues. I conceived that I stood in the place of a father to him. I believe he loved and respected me. It was my endeavour to inspire him with notions of virtue and honour; and I flatter myself he profited by my lessons — which tended to put aside the idea of rigid control and distance, that is so apt to render relations or guardians disagreeable in the eyes of young people; and having done foi naturally concluded that, I should have the whole of my
B 2 kinsman
4
kinsman’s confidence, which he could not have reposed better than in one where there was no chance of its being abused. He has, however, for Some
tirne past, thought fit to treat me with
>

a certain neglect, which I have not otherwise noticed than by a return of indifference. This he Seems not to regard, as he can form other friendships, ' other connexions, and draw from them flattering ideas, v/bich, it is to be feared, time will
a
never realise. Unfortunately, I doubt for him, he has chosen for a friend and companion a young fellow, of rank and fortune I confess, but one whose morals will not bear the test;

forbear corresponding with him, though I still watch over him with an anxious eye, for his good, and am better acquainted with the conduct he adopts than, I believe, he imagines. In the mean time, if it happens, my Lord, that he should visit at your house, as he has been ■

YOUR congratulations, my worthy and rdfpected friend, cannot but be acceptable, as I know they ^^‘'teome from the heart. How many do I

\
OF F O R T I T U IE 0 g
I deemed it peculiarly unlucky that my indispofition Should occasion my cousin Merton to quit a Scene of innocent recreation to come to the house of mourning! As youth is the season for pleasure, So I wish to see all young persons, of either sex, enjoy it, according to their rank and situation in life, within the bounds of moderation and virtue. It has formed no Small part of my happiness to observe this young man treading in the paths of redlitude. — Such were the earlier days of my brother. Thus, in the very dawn of youth, did he accustom himself to laudable habits, which, daily unfolding themselves, rendered him the
B 5 delight
lo
delight of his friends and acquaintance, and promised to make him an ornament to his country. — But our
tears h$ve embalmed his memory! — Let our praises be given to those who
copy his virtues I
As to your nephew, my dear Colonel, it is long since I had the plea
i
Sure of feeing him. His other con nexions, doubtless, take up too much of his time to allow him for a moment to think of Bromley park. I am Sorry they are Such as you do not approve. There is nothing of greater consequence than the company we make choice of in our early years, as from thence the future complexion of our lives is apt to take
the
  II
the strongest tincture. Though this maxim is not new ^ yet it is one that cannot be too often repeated and inculcated on youth, as So much of their happiness or infelicity must depend on the observance or neglect of it. But as a good disposition and a clear understanding appear to be united in Mr. Euston, it is to be
hoped and expected that if he has fallen into any errors, too common at
his time of life, he will see and amend them before it is too late. There was a time, indeed, when I thought an alliance between our families might have taken place: — I believe that is a matter now not to be expected; but the alliance of

LETTER XXXIV
MISS ELIZA ELSE TO MISS CAROLINE
STANMORE.
July is,
portune is truly unkind to you, my dear Caroline 1 but you must not, therefore, be unkind to yourself. If you cannot have the man of your choice, that is no reason why you should fuster yourself to be urged To accept of one with whom you are likely to be unhappy.
You
*
14 '
You Seem to think it is vain to expect anything from your mother’s
t
tenderness, Have you forgot at what a distance you are now from her? When you return home your presence may do much with her, and perhaps even with Mr. stan more; at least you can but make the trial, as there is no cause for hurrying this intended match, which
A
can, you know, never be brought about, if you act with the resolution. All the danger is, that from an idea
4
of respect and dutiful fubmistion, my friend should bring upon herself “a world of woe.”
The affair you mention of Mr. basil is strange; but the more mysterious

  i5
terlous it Seems, there appears, in my Small judgement, the less reason for Sufpecting him of any actual or intended evil. A matter of this supposed magnitude ought to be brought forward, that the accused may have a chance of clearing himself; so that, whatever may be intended, I see no friendship evidenced by the concealment. — Whilst a whisper goes round, the good-natured world are always apt to suppose the worst that can be
imagined; and when nothing is absolutely alleged, there is not room
for contradiction. But, my dear, as you have not forgot that Mr. Basil has an unnatural brother, and that brother has a mistress, whom he is
always
l6
always promising one day to make his wdfe, and who is capable of urging him to any mischief, these circumstances being kept in remembrance, should incline you to think, whatever the allegation may be, that this, like the rest, is Something that originates from their machinations
rather than to conclude that your
%
lover is a villain and a hypocrite.
It vas, however, an unfortunate hour for the young gentleman to avow his passion; but it was at a
I
time when all his fen fa dons were awake, and he acted accordingly. Alas! Caroline, you knew not the situation of your own heart till it was thus explored ^ and, it must be
acknow»
  IJ
acknowledged, that you have found it in an inauspicious season. But time only, which discovers all things, can determine whether you ought to be Sorry or rejoice for the impression the Soft passion has made in your bosom.
As for my lover, he has advanced a step or two farther; he has assfured me, by one of cupid’s messengers, in the usual way, that if I listen from him I shall have nothing to fear (he does not mean to ravish or carry me off, like a discourteous knight); and he acquaints me that his name is Sandby — repeating what he Set out with aster ting, and what it would be an affront to myself not to
premise.
l8
premise, That his designs are honourable.’’ We have not yet had an interview, but I know not how Soon we may, when certain preliminaries are Settled. I would fain have had him unfold his pretensions at once to my uncle; Since, according to the account he gives of himself, the old gentleman could have no plausible objection to his addrefiing me, unless he means to condemn me to a Single
■
bssa Slate, or retain me to attend on him
during his natural life. — I trust he will not be so unreasonable. But this matter will furhish us with a topic of discourse, if we Should meet. In the mean time, my dear, I am really anxious about your Situation,
and
✓
  i9
and wish the next letter of yours I receive may be dated from your own house, for the reason that I have already afiigned; and I fancy, on re fiedtion, you will find reason to approve the advice, of
%
Your

Eliza Else.

FRANCIS EUSTON, ESQ TO THE HON.
J. HOLTON.
London, July lo.
J Perceive, dear Jack, that there is a necessity for me at preshnt to determine decisively on the line of conduct I am in future to pursue— — it is to be that formally prescribed by grave books, and inculcated by careful relations, or that which we are apt to conceive more
liberal,

  21
liberal, as being under less control
from our own doubts or fears, or the opinions of others. By endeavouring to strike out a middle path between these seeming extremes, it appears that I have begun to wander in a sort of maze, from which it is proper that I Should think betimes of extricating myself. There have been some situations, wherein, if I had followed the one mode, I Should have gone farther; whilst, according to the other, perhaps I Should not have gone So far. It is plain, that I must resolve either to subject: myself to those rules and restridlions which are dignified with lofty sounding names, and are connected with the
belief
22
I
belief of Systems, the necestity of which I begin to doubt, or I must determine to think freely for myself, which leads to a consequent freedom of action. You will wonder that I even hesitate to choose the latter; but you ought to allow for
the prejudices of education, and that regard for the opinions of the world which is So apt to tindfure our manners. The epithets of Atheist and Libertine, So commonly bestowed on those who shake off the shackles put upon them by custom, are disagreeable to hear; and to avoid them is, perhaps, the chief motive that urges many to act upon Such prin ciples as induce them to many acts of self-denial,
. I am
  23
I am led into these reflections partly by the tenor of your last letter, and partly by Some conversation I had
with Lord Bromley, whom I visited
/
other day. I found his Lord ship recently recovered from a fit of the stone. Sickness, we know, makes most men thoughtful, and when they are declining in the vale of years, adds to the gravity of their difpofl tion. This worthy Baron is a man whom my uncle always taught me to respect. He has a niece, for whom I once entertained something of a childish passion; on which circumstance, I believe, the Colonel formed expectations of making an alliance
with that family But that impres

«
24
fion is worn off, and I cannot Say I have ever been urged about the matter; perhaps the young lady has got another Sweetheart; at least her family and fortune are such as may ensure her the most flattering offers, to say nothing of her person and accomplishments, which most people
will think worthy of notice.
But, to return from this digression— — found Lord Bromley rather. disposed to chide me, though in his usual mild way, for paying, of late, so little attention to my old friend. After he had made several observations on the imprudent and thoughtless conduct of youth, which I took - as fide wind reflections on my own,
I brought
V
O F F O R T I T 0 D E. 25
I brought his Lordship nearer to the point, by inquiring after my uncle’s health. He then ventured to peak more plainly; and, arraigning my behaviour to him, observed, that no connexions I could form (even were
they to appear ever So valuable)
%
ought to be put in competition with. the Coioners friendship. I answer ed, by admitting this; but begged leave to remark that my good relation had also his arcana and Some ^ of the greatest consequence, as he has Said; which, though they coni

cerned my late father and why not me, his oitly fons), he always declined trusting me with, because he has alleged they were not yet ripe VOL.II. C for
V
26
for communication. I urged, that I might plead a similar excuse, and Said, that as I had last written to my uncle, in a respedlful manner, the flight lay on his fide rather than on mine.
The Peer Seemed Surprised at Such
a mode of defence — I guested il would Surprise him; and I had made use of it, as Some learned counsel dc in their way, to perplex the cause j this being estedfed, I turned the discourse, and the disagreeable Subject was renewed no more during my stay at Bromley paik, which I made as short as postible.
From what has pasted, you will suppose it likely that I have broke
with
  2^
with my uncle; and you know that for the present I have lost my mis tressit is my consolation that I retain my friend; — it is my happiness that I am. not offended at his apparent censures.
amelia’s Sudden retreat could not but excite vexation. However, the first gust of passion being over, I had leisure to form my resolution, which is, to pursue the jilt, if Such She be, and to gratify my desires in one way, if I cannot come up to the extent of my wishes in another.
The difficulties you meet with in the prosecution of your amour, are Such as, I judge, will only stimulate you to more eagerness in the pursuit;

r is still my lot, my valued friend, to be a complainant. Fortune yet ^ delights in persecuting me; I find continually new Sources of unhappi ness.
The coolness of Lord Bellgrove was not imaginary; it increased during the short remainder of the festival; at the conclusion of which, a letter was delivered to me, by one of the performers, that at once put an

out against the Solicitations of one not Suited to her temper, and an union with whom, there is reason to think, may make her unhappy.
For my own part, I have thought of quitting (I will not say forever, but for a seasoii) the place of my birth, which has hitherto been to me the land of misfortune; there is a chain of causes, which being once broken, the affairs of life may take a different turn. Who knows but

my adopting a measure of Such a

Amongst other circumstances, it can hardly be doubted but my leaving England will prove matter of satisfaction to a brother, who seems impatient of my existing in our common native land.
I will not ask you, my Dear Sir, to protect my charadlcr against those who may assume a double privilege of insulting me from my absence. I know not whether your reputation may not Suffer by a too Sedulous adherence to my interests, or a constant unvaried defence of my conduct— — my name, for a while, fink

YOUR letter, my dear Amelia, I cannot but be inclined to rank among those productions of the pen which prove, while we write them, that we are either unacquainted with the feelings of our own hearts, or wish to render those foto whom we address ourselves.
When I recommended to you to receive the addresses of Mr. Aileshy,
whilst

whilst I attempted to introduce a new lover, I wished likewise to make a trial whether you had shaken oss the partiality you Seemed to entertain “for the man whom you hac begun to esteem.” If I guest aright, according to the usual modcj of judging in such affairs, you have not yet gained that victory over £ growing inclination; till you have, perhaps the introduction of a new object may not be so proper. I an: not over fond of choosing for people in matters of this nature; and 1 heartily wish you had been enabled to make a good choice foi yourself. Your situation has beer
Somewhat peculiar indeed; but as tc

the article relative to your birth, you dwell too much upon that. In the opinion of a true lover. Such an ingenious confefiion, as you mention, would have charms Sufficient to overbalance the supposed defect, in which there can exist no moral turpitude, nor any real inconvenience; and as to the other part of the objection, I trust we have worthy persons, of different ages and defcrip

Thus I have considered the matter as you desired, and here you have the resuit. Far from leading you

LORD MOUNTFORD TO GEORGI AILS
#
es(i.
A FTER So long an absence from
the friend of my earlier years, it was an untoward circumstance to be obliged to content myself with a conversation of a few hours with him on my arrival in England. But this duty and my promise demanded, and I complied accordingly.
We mould have been happy in your presence at the anniversary. It

Yet here, as at all similar astem blies, it will Sometimes happen that circumstances may occur rather of a displeafing nature; in which cafe, all that can be done is to take every measure. to prevent, as much as pos sible, their breaking in on the ge neral harmony.

give him an invitation to Bellgrove place, where they both arrived during the time of the festival. This Mr. Basil is Said to be persecuted by his brother, at the instigation of a favourite mistress. Indeed our stranger guest was no Sooner arrived than it was thought necestary to clear up Some ill reports Spread of him, which were supposed to originate from that quarter. This being done, he was received with unfeigned pleasure;
/
and, notwithstanding an apparent dis pofition to be Serious, yet he had the power of assuming Such a sweetness of manners, and is really postested of So many genteel accomplishments, as recommended him highly to the vol. II D com f

this young man, because I real! thought he deserved it.

Previous to his arrival here, V were favoured with the company ( miss Caroline Stanmore. This youn lady derives no lustre from her ran

her beauty and merit, which are Sue as cannot pass unnoticed. I own the

came hither unaccompanied, by fp<

was the more consistent with propriety, and the less observed by the eyes of most who Surrounded us. But,
-- ^uis faltere pojjit amantem F
there were those who remarked this, and, as ft appears, penetrated my thoughts, I will not Say my designs, for I had formed none, but was led,
I know not whither, by a sort of Sweet delusion.
There were two of our guests who Set me down for a dangerous rival; the one was Mr. Holton, a young gentleman of rank and independence; the
other, to my surprise, this Mr. Basil
*
with all the appearance of openness, knows how to veil his designs in
%
the most artful manner imaginable.
D 2 The
52 T Ht
The former has openly profcltec himself the lady’s lover, after having made an application to her parents, in which he Succeeded to his wishes j the latter formed private Schemes, ir which they were never meant to be consulted. We found that he had laid a plan, in concert with Some oi his former companions, to carry oil miss Stanmore, whether with hei own consent we know not, but from her character and conduct towards him, we judge the contrary. In the execution, the rules of hospitality were in more respedts than one to be violated; and, on the pretence of my being likely to prove the greatest obstacle to his wishes, my Sentence was
the
• s
  53
s
the Severest. I shall not trouble you, my dear friend, with farther particulars of this rasti and wicked plot, of which it was my counsel to wait the issue thus warned; but Lord bell grove would not admit the thought of such a scene of confusion. My next design was to offer single combat to Basil; but that was overruled by the consideration that a man who would play the russian did not deserve to be encountered as a gentleman. The idea of bringing this intended mischief to a proof, and fixing the accusation on the party, was repressed, on account of the public talk it would occasion, and the injury the lady’s character might suffer undefcrvedly, if, as it was presumed,
D 3 she
V
54
She was innocent of the matter. It was determined, therefore, only tc cause a letter to be delivered, intimating that his bufiness was discovered, exhorting him to tread in other paths, and desiring his absence from a place where he had meditated f much mischief. This extraordinary man complied, but not till he had sought for my father and myself who were purposely gone abroad, in order to avoid altercation on a fub jcdl: which might have carried us beyond due bounds, just at the conclusion of a Scene of cheerfulness, and festivity.
Thus one rival is removed; foj Such I cannot but esteem him. In the meantime, Mr. Holton still remains,
  55
mains, and plies the lady with unwearied assiduity. For my own part, considering the difficulties before me,
I know not with what propriety I
\
can appear in the character of a lover. Holton is perpetually before her, and has the Sandlion of her parents; or if she really regarded basil, his image is likely to be still in her heart. For myself, I am fensible She never ffiewed the least signs of partiality; if She had, my Situation would have enabled me to discover and improve: them. besides all this, I can have no designs but Such as are honourable; and I have not a hope of ever ■ gaining the content of Lord and Lady Bellgrovc to a match of this
D 4 nature
\

nature. To adl in contradidlion to them would create family disputes; and you know my dispofitipn So well as to conclude that circumstance would take much from my felicity.
Though, from the discovery I have mentioned, it was So evident that Basil meant to treat me as a rival, yet my parents never chose to take notice of this, but rather to understand that he considered me as the lady’s protector, because she was under our roof, which was a wilful misunderstanding, adopted, apparently on puri

pose, to avoid all investigation of the Subject.
This bufiness has discomposed the Bari, whilst I begin to feel myself the
more
• *
/
  57
more anxious, as I conceive the probability of enjoying the object of my wishes to be farther removed. Sometimes I wish I had avowed my inclinations as soon as they had birth; then again I check that reflection, for those reasons which I have just now assigned. These fluctuations, I fear, are signs of a pashon, which, could a lover consult prudence, she would
bid him by all means discourage.

JOHN SEYWARD TO SIR FREDERIC BASIL.
• «
I
Honoured Sir, August i.
YOUR brother is gone from bell grove place; he staid no longer
till just as the feasting was over. During his stay, I got acquainted with David, a servant of his, a Welshman, and endeavoured, by means of that man, to make out what I could concerning his master. He said, he was greatly respected by my Lord for his goodness, and because it was
supposed
*

supposed he was used cruelly by hi nearest relation, I suppose meaning your honour. As I pretended to b ignorant of all concerning Sue! things, and gave in to whatever David Said, when he praised his master wishing I was in Service myself, So could but get one as good, therefore he trusted me innocently with all h knew j and Mr. Charles, as I find did not take much care about hidini anything from him. Now you honour is to understand that Davi has been at Sea, and he can read am write pretty well, which, very likely your brother does not know. How soever that is, he Saw Some copies C letters to Mr. Merton, and by the!

he found out that Mr Basil was in love with miss Caroline Stanmore, a young lady of no great fortune, but who has expedlations of a deal at the death of a relation. The earl’s fon, just arrived from his travels, seemed to have a kindness for her likewise; and Mr. Holton, whom I believe your honour has Seen, made love to this young lady publicly.
While I was studying how I might
I
make Some handle of what David had been So ignorant as to tell me, I found things were taking a Surprising turn. Among the visitors at bell grove place was a Lady Juletta Sabine, a lovely widow, who, attacking different persons in her coquettish
I
72
tifh way, found miss Stanmore pn ferred by almost all of them; ar
particularly by my young Lord an Mr. Holton, of whom She ha
thought to make a conquest. Whether she had intelligence, or wheth< women See into matters of intrigi more deeply than men, it is not ft me to judge, but She was either ai sured, or strongly fancied, that Mj Charles Basil was Smitten with Mi Caroline. On this, I Suppose, st built a design of making it Suppose,, her rival’s stay at Bellgrove Place was dangerous, and wished; to be understood that your brothe would raise a disturbance there, 0 her account, with Lord Mountford.

I was introduced to this lady, by means of her Servant, and found that she was just in the cue for a matter of this sort. She entered freely into difcourse with me, and told me she wished it to be understood that Mr, Basil had laid a plot to carry off Miss Stanmore as Soon as the festivity at Bellgrove place was ended.
Being thus entrusted to form the plan, which was intended for tshe disgrace of Miss Stanmore, I thought it would be easy to turn the great hinge of the bufiness against Mr. Basil, whereby he would at least lose, all his credit, and be forced to leave this place of feasting in a manner very different from that in which he

my naaterials, when I went to work upon them.
Without inquiring what reason hei ladyship had to be So sure of youi brother’s designs, as I had desired her to leave all to my management. Hammond and Sykes being luckili with me, knowing them devoted tc your Service, we framed a plan, or the ground of Lady juletta’s, witi proper alterations, and a letter was lent by these, under feigned names,

SIR FREDERIC BASIL TO JOHN SEYWARD. D£alt JOHM| basil house, August 5.
’yhe breach between Charles and the Bellgrove family is just as I would have wished; though it has happened in a manner that I could not expect, I can Sec no good reason for doubting that the ground work of the whole, as Lady Juletta told you, might be true; for, with all his Seeming tranquillity of temper, Charles is very enterprizing, and of
E 4 a darin g
8o T HET R I U M R H's
C
a daring Spirit, of which I have hat cause to be Sensible. There is nt wonder, theresore, fraught as he i with idle notions, that he Shouh undertake anything as romantic and much more desperate, than al that he had planned, according to he ladytship’s' first state of the matter but he knows how to put on a mof decekful'appearance,.
In addition to what you have com municated, I have heard, from an other quarter, that he intends goin| abroad (tomake ihs, grand tour,. t(
$
be Sure, .attended by his Welshman) this is another romantic Scheme o his; but it is one that I shall by m
t
means attempt to hinder. To com
pal

  8i
pass it, I know he is about to disposs
.. ■. >
of a little reversion to much disadvantage, which, with all his boasted honesty, I never heard that he offered to do to pay his creditors. thia is the last resource of his extravagance; So it behoves him to make the most of it, which yet, I rest af sured, he will not do — for if any idle whimsy falls in his way, that he can dignify with the name of generosity, he will presently sting away his coin, so fond is he of being be praifed; and yet you find he manages matters so badly, that little praise falls to his share; but he suffers for his own follies; and, like the Quakers, calls those Sufferings persecution - is
E 5 his
82
his very rational conduct; and, if I am not mistaken in my calculation, it will cause him to live and die a beggar.
You will perceive by the inclosed draught, that I have not forgot you. It will repay dishurfements, and the rest you will keep for your own use. Ere long, I shall write to you on the subject we mentioned, when I Saw you last. Time will not stay; and as it is not possible to judge the event, of things, I am resolved to take the only measure that can be likely to prevent a title and ample fortune from falling to an improper person. I think the means are now furnished
me, and I intend making use of them.
I must
✓
  83
I must determine to brave the opinion of the world, in a matter that does not concern them; as my views of advantage in marriage are at an end, I will gratify my other wishes, and put censure at defiance.
You will remain where you are, at present, till you hear from me again; in the meantime, whatever further you can learn of miss Stan
more, you will communicate to.

occasion of my being Sent foi home, - my dear Eliza, vas the desperate state of health of my cousin Seymour, who was fupposed to be almost at the point of death, stie is,
however, yet living, though there
\
can hardly be a doubt but this will prove her last illness. It was thought proper that I Should attend her. To
visit
© T ' F O R T I T U D E'. 2'^
vifi’t the Sick is a duty, to which I have no objection; but when I recollect the dependence that our family have upon this gentlewoman, I cannot help fearing that Such absenes will be considered in a, mercenary point of view. For my own part,, I have no such ideas, a little will serve me y why then Should I. wisli.for a
fuperfiuity ^ ‘
Before I left Bellgrove Place, I had a conversation with the Earl and his Lady, in the course of which, I was furprised to find,, they seemed acquainted with Mr. bafil’s attachment to me, and still more So, to understand, it was something he. meant to undertake.on .my account,
that.
68
that rendered his stay at that place impossible, and made him criminal in the eyes of the family. I perceived I was to be founded on thij occasion: : it was, my innocence must be evinced by my ig norance, which his Lordship did nol choose to enlighten. — As I was nol perfectly satisfied with this condudf^ we parted, with a, coolness which 1 was sorry for, and which would nol at all contribute to restore the tranquillity of my mind, that had beer So recently disturbed at the close oi a Scene of pleasure.
At home I find myself less at eafcj
r
than might be wished or expected, My Father Seems to regard me rather
with
  87.
with the watchsul eye of a governor, than the tender affection of a parent; and my mother cannot show her wonted tenderness, because she makes a point of copying him in everything. In the meantime, I hear nothing but the commendations of Mr. Holton, with whose presence, however, we have not been honoured here, though he left Bellgrove place, as I conceive, with that intention ^ But, I believe, he has been desired to withhold his visits, till the event of my aunt’s illness is finally determined; this is, indeed, a relpite for me; I am sorry the cause should be of So melancholy a nature.
It has been reported that Mr. basil is actually preparing to go abroad; this
corresponds

correspondence has it with any thin
%
he did, or. intended at Bellgrove Place; and what could he undertak for. me, to bring him into disgrac there, whether merited or unmeritet and render it a matter eligible or northeast ceffary for him, at this juncture, t quit England?
I think I am resolved, at any rat not to Sacrifice my happiness, b becoming the wife of Holten; { the Same time, you will observ< in my situation, whilst I retain a affection for Mr. Basil, this is likes to fall little Short af a resolve of ce libacy, which I am not to preserv in an undisturbed retirement,, bu most probably, to be continually in
terrupte
  89
terrupted with offers that I cannot accept, and commands which it is a pain for me not to obey.
Nor have I even the romantic comfort of an assurance that I have fixed my regard on one.of the most excellent of men. It seems that people havestong been divided in their opinions of this youth,, who, I confess, appeared to me almost all perfection; and now the Scale rather preponderates against him. After having apparently forfeited the good opinion of a person of the Karl of bell grove’s known virtues and. sound
judgement, the world will incline to
%
the worst fide of the perfpedlive; and what I view as all light,, may have
the
%
90
the appearance of the depth of fhac to others.
I can most readily admit, my dea what you have urged in behalf t
the accused; to me it appears mo rational; but the question is, ho' far ought I to trust my own decifioi - where I am So likely to be prejudicec The criminal has a good chance Sc
acquittal where the judge makes
«
strong party in his favour.
After all, mine is a Situation ( fuspenfe and infelicity j — the draugl: of life, I perceive, will be early embittered to me; nor have I the pro fpcct of anything to Sweeten it. hope my friend will find it mor agreeable.

I have heard the name, and Somewhat of the charadfer of your Suitor, my dear. — My father mentions him as a young man of fortune and reputation. His family are chiefly in the mercantile line; but his father has long since left off bufiness, and is retired into the country. This his Son, besides what he will inherit from him, amounting to estates of no Small account, has already in pos scffion a genteel independence left him by his grandmother. He will be an object worth your concern, as far as I can understand, if he is free from a connexion that he formed early in life, which they Say has cost
him Some trouble. It is mentioned
as
*
92
as the only weakness which ht turned out to his prejudice.. Yc will guess,,. Eliza, that it was a
f
amour, and, as I am told,, with or
of his mother’s domestics. Th
«
woman has haunted him ever sine Unworthy to be made his wife, an — as inconstant in her disposition as ur endearing in her manners, stie w: not content with a stipend he alloyed her, though it was such as er abled her to live above her statio; Neither law nor justice, confcienc nor reason could require more that his r but his paramour was not of temper to be fatisfiedshe pre tended to have a contract of marria^

of fortune, which his sense ought to

teach him were bestowed for better purposes. Affeeftion and friendship, my Lord, may well be alienated by Such a conduct as his; but in this matter I will interfere to prevent a crime, and Save him from himself. That done — if he perfists in slighting my advice, and refuses to return to the paths of rectitude, I shall abandon him to his own follies, and endeavour to forget Such a wcrthless kinsman; nor shall any

But what is all this to the litua tlon of my heart, which, however

August 20.
JJERE IS a new Scene opened,
Eliza, and Such a one as I little
expected. I know not that I shall ever behold Mr. Holton again in the character of a lover; yet am I not to experience tranquillity, since another has put in his claim to what neither can ever obtain — a place in my affections.
My father Says, the character of Mr. Holton has turned out, on inquiry, Such as he cannot approve >
that
112
that he keeps a mistress, and is too much involved in dissipation to be a fit match for me. Perhaps this was no less than might have been known before; but it is not my business to pafs an opinion on the motives of my V parent’s actions. He is now discarded; and to surprise you, my dear, I must tell you, that I am commanded to receive a noble Suitor — Lord Mountford has declared himself my lover, and is, expetsted here daily. Thus am I to be flattered with the idea of titles added to wealth. Alas 1 that they are not offered those to whom they would be truly welcome.
It was only to acquaint you with this particular that I took up my
pen,
/
I
I
  II
pen, as I know there is nothing which concerns me that does not appear interesting to my Eliza, who is ready to Sympathise with her friend in gries. — When will the day arrive wherein stie can exult with her in her felicity,
I received the news of this change of Sentiment in my parents with an indifference, of which my mother took Some notice, while my father shook his head, and gave hints that he was not insensible of my mind's being otherwise employed than on either of the pershns in question. I was then entertained with a panegyric on the young Lord: — I do not presume to Say that more was attributed
y
114 the triumphs
bated to him in the course of it than he really deferyed; nor can I doubi the sincerity of his profefilons. ^ Whilst I admire at the Earl of bell grove’s approving Such an attachment, I can only regret that his Lordship has not fixed his affections on Some deserving female, who is capable of making him a suitable return, without which one of his dis pofition cannot fail of being unhappy in the marriage state.
To convince this worthy young nobleman of a truth so important tc his. happiness is what I could most sincerely wish to do, in an open and explicit manner; but, in this cafe, my situation is delicate. Lord
Mountford
or   II
Mountford knows his rival, though it should appear that the Bellgrove family have mistaken his pririciples, and Suffered themselves, by Some means, : to be deceived as to his conduct.

A
on every fide, and precluded from acting with that frankness which is natural to my djspofition. See now what is the consequence of my entertaining a virtuous pafiion!

I am obliged to you for the generous pains you took to retain a fugi gitive; but were not your arguments, my dear Sir, rather used as with an Axile? — That character I did not intend to assume. I believe I have already observed that I only meant to withdraw from a sort of cloud that

If I have made a Small Sacrifice to enable me to retreat from England, I hope I have made it with Some judgement.

In the meantime, I call reason and fortitude to my aid; and, Secure, as you have Said, in the armour of innocence, I do not cease to think existence a blesting, but take all due means to render it eligible, which was the design of Heaven that gave it.

FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.
September 2.
TN my last I told you of my introduction to the family of Count de B -- --, and I mentioned that his
cousin regarded me with attention; I Scar it has been with too much attention for her peace. By her means 1 have made one at all their
parties, while mademoiselle S --
has taken pains to be particular with me. I am deceived if She has not a lover, a young gentleman of no small estate, to whom this must have given some anxiety. Why was I fated to cause uneasiness without design, when
it
w
f
/
$
  125
V
k would be my greatest pleasure to impart felicity?
The significant looks of this gentleman are such as, I think, I can easily translate, though I appear by no means to comprehend them. —
(
But from the Count I meet with the most flattering respect, so that it appears as if he would have no objection of my forming an alliance with a family of which I almost appear (though an Englishman and a Protestant) to have become one already.
The count’s d.iucliter.'who is past: thirty, is on the eve of rnarriage with a French ofliccr; and the c.)ld gentleman says, it shall not be bis fault, provided Some obstacles are got over, if there is not another
G 7 weddine
126
wedding celebrated under his roos Shortly after their union.
Whilst I hear all this, and cannot be blind to the methods which the lady takes of strewing her partiality for me, my heart is elsewhere— — re member that I have left my love in the land where I left my friend; — the image is Sufficient to engross my attention. It is thus that, in Spite of my endeavours to the contrary, I am absent, as it were, in the midst of pleasure, and alone while surrounded by company.
At the fiime time I find nothing here but what wears a face agreeable enough; the cshearfulnefs, vivacity, and, if you will, the thoiightleu'nefs of
the Parisians, are not without their / ^
charms;
I
I
  HJ
charms; So that if I had not been rather deadened by a long Succession of ills, one could Scarcely help being merry to keep them company.
The insincerity of the French, which people talk So much of, if it
really existed in the degree reported,
can only be a matter of concern in
/
the more Serious connedlions of life. As much as I value the opposite virtue, I cannot look for it in every one whom I meet by chance at a coffeehouse, or a theatre, or join in an as fembly room. — Good-humour, and good manners, being all the requisites in Such Situations, it would be quite ufeless, by inquiries into the sincerity of the parties, to fuspend our temporary fatissadlion. — Not to
G 4 he
izs
be deceived, we have only to treat compliments as words of course, since all know them to be Such; and
professions made without motives, as
$
a higher Sort of compliments, unless,
by proof, we find them otherwise
: — thus in Paris a man needs
not be frecjuently disappointed. — I
could even hazard a conjedfure, that
«
people’s own vanity, leading them to apply more than ever was intended, has a share in many delusions of this sort which they complain of. So that they are more accessary to their own disappointment than they ever acknowledge, or perhaps than they themselves are ready to imagine.
V
I must hi eak off here, as the Count wishes to see me; I shall resume my
pen
  i29
p5n when I return from the convers

Sation.
IT is no other than I expected— — Count has made proposals to me on behalf of his fair kinswoman— —
could do nothing, but most respedt fully decline them. I was Sincere enough to say my heart was en
I
gauged; indeed I did not see hov/ I could well offer any other apology for a refusal by which I was most unwilling to offend those who had treated me with unbounded hospitality.
It may be Said, I might have made the difference of our religion an objection;; besides that this would have been starting a disagreeable topic, we know there are numerous
G 5 instances
$
L 0   •A
instances where, by acceding to certain stipulations, properly Suggested, Such distindtions have not interrupted family concord. I think you will not censure me for leaving religion out of the question.
The count’s looks strewed the uneasiness that my refusal gave him, though he received it with polite ness, only saying, he was sorry that his family could not have the honour of Such an alliance, and changed
V
%
the discourse to another subject..
it is not to be fupposed I can be on the Same terms as usual at this nobleman’s house, though it is a delicate matter to break off the intimacy : in effect, it is what a Frenchman could do in London better than
an
/
V
  II
an Englishman in Paristhe pari fian will tell us, that is because the Englishman has too much sensibili ty; but this is one of the gifts of which we are generally tenacious, though it proves the cause of many anxieties.
I am therefore to Seek out new acquaintance and connetstions; but I have the consolation to observe, that this does not Seem a difficult matter here; the difficulty will rather lie in
withdrawing from the former one. It is a matter that requires Some resolution.
In the meantime, the misfrefs of my affections has, perhaps, yielded to the importunities of her relations, and made my rival blessed! If She has
G 6 done
132
stone So, I ought to be content, provided she has not rendered herself unhappy. But, let it be as it may, ycu will let me know the true state of things, that I may endeavour to stifpose my mind accordingly.
I should be a self flatterer if I could suppose in earnest what appears very well for what I call a Speculative Sally, or metaphysteal fancy. How far the distribution of happinest in general is equal here below, it is not for me to determine; but as an individual, I have little consolation in the expedla tion of much felicity to come, merely because I have experienced many embarraflrnents. Alas! how many
worthy persons Suffer a continuation of misfortunes, almost from the na
tcil
  j33
Ul to the dying hour, of whom our poet Gay; in one of his melancholy moods, has exclaimed.
Ah! what to them avails the light of heaven.
Since still misfortune marks their dreary way;
Whether to their unhappy lot be giv’n
death’s long cold night, or life’s short busy day!
But perhaps it will be more profitable to us to proceed on the path marked out, with as much virtue and prudence as we can, than to employ ourselves in investigating these dif pensations. Our view is but partial, and therefore it is unphilosophical to fuppose we can be competent judges of a general System.
Notwithstanding a certain apparent prediletstion that Some have observed in me towards serioufness, ' I cannot Sometimes help doubting whether a vivacity of Spirit, and even a disposition

134
fition to innocent trifling does not render people happier than too much depth of thought, and that without impeaching their understanding. But whatever I may say here, it is not in my power to alter my own temper, if I am framed to think, and be unhappy all I can do is endeavouring not to deserve it.
Your Sentiments, relative to innocence accused, are more than just — for they are generous: — all, as far as they relate to an individual, who, perhaps, has already been to you the cause of Some anxiety, accept the best thanks of the most sincere, because, perhaps, the most obliged of your friends,

This dress, these charms, and the artillery of the eyes, were played off at me in vain; but there were not wanting others who viewed her with the most pleased attention, whilst I really felt myself concerned at the thought of the lady’s having fixed her regards on one like me, that had it not in his power to return them.

THE SAME TO THE SAME
Bordeaux, October 10.
J LEFT my nartive land to avoid cares and embarrassments; to be Sree from anything that might disturb my peace, and that of others,
I quitted Paris; yet it appeared that I was not to enjoy all the tranquil lity I could hope for (a mere privation of pain and trouble) in my absence
from my country and the wo
#
that I loved.
According
l66 THE T R i U M P H S
According to my resolution, I Set out from Pari s on the very day and hour I intended, accompanied only by my faithful Welshman, who has learned to jabber a little French, and, a Swiss valet, of whose abilities and faithfulness I had an excellent cha radfer.
I had dissembled an indisposition before my departure, I was really in difposed on the road, which occasioned some delay in my journey. However, I reached the. next village on the road to Bordeaux one evening a little before Sunset.
At Some Small distance from the town, a young Frenchman, well mounted joined my company; he put
up
I
/
 , 167
jp at the Same inn and would have supped with me, but that a return ds my indispofition occasioned me to retire earlier to bed than usual, and Pasting for the present, as is my custom when I find any illness that affects me accompanied by an oppression
at the stomach.
%
♦
I had but just arisen the next morning, when my Welshman came to rhe, apparently much alarmed, and told me that we vere beset. The meaning of this I could not conceive, but, taking up my pistols, I
hastened to inquire of the landlord,
/
who, as I found, had barricaded the doors, and made all fast, as if he expected a siege, at the request of the
young
168 ‘
young gentleman, of whose face I began to recolletst I had some knowledge.
*
The youth Seemed much agitated;
T it was him the assailants demanded.
But the innkeeper denied that any Such person was there. He desired my protection. — I asked what was his crime, or what occasioned this visit from the party of whom I had now a clear view from a little window on the staircase. He Said he could not, just at that time, give me a particular answer, but would stiortly satisfy me; in the meantime, I might deperid that he had not offended against any law, divine or human he added, that the person who had
ibrought
  169

There was no time to discourfe farther; for the astailants, consisting of two gentlemen and four attendants, prepared for the attack, and the innkeeper, having armed three of his people to repel them, was soon joined by myself, my Welshman, and the French valet. David insisted we w’ere strong enough, we should make a Sally; but the general opinion was against this; for my own

dissemble. In a steady tone and manner, I censured her temerity, though in the mildest mode, whilst I once more avowed that my heart was engaged, and that my mind was, in this respect, incapable of changing.
Tears flowed from, her eyes; * — contending passions heaved - in her

her, in appeasing her relations, for Such I naturally supposed Some of those to be who had come in' pursuit of her. After Some hesitation and faltering.

This eclaircissement had taken up So much time, that the party returned strongly reinforced, and accompanied by the officers of justice. There was, at first, a prospedl of the Ibrmer Scene being renewed, but as

Soon as the innkeeper dishovered the

auxiliaries that were brought to the field, he lost all thoughts of resistance, and Smartly reproached us for bringing him into Such a dilemma,
though Mademoiselle V -- -- had presented
him with a handsome Sum of money, previous to the attack made upon his territories.
I found that an instant determination must be formed, and therefore requested the lady to retire, whilst I advanced to meet her brother, who was by this time, with all his train, at the gate, the wounded gentleman

Sufferings, my dear friend, are continually proved to be kept pace with by your fortitude. — your prudence is Such as conveys you Safely through the storms of adverse fate, while your Spirit rises under misfortune, and makes you greater at the instant that you might be supposed to fink beneath it.

better reason at the shrine of this phantom of friend ship ^ and was the very counterpart of his companion. This was no other than your first rival 5 who, with many qualities that would dishonour persons in a lower Sphere, is denominated the Honourable J. Holton. Devoid of all good principles himself, he instilled his baneful poison into the breast of young

The nephew of Colonel Merton having thrown off all regard for the precepts of his kinsman, and at length for those of religion and morality, attempted the chastity of a female, to whom he had introduced himself in the most insinuating manner, appearing at first as her protector. His
uncle, his benefactor, chanced to in

him; and, opposing his vicious designs, fell in the contest.
Need I picture to you the horrors of this youth, who was willing to Surrender himself into the hands of j uf tice. On the return of that reflection, which he had long banished,

  189
he could not forgive himself, and deemed no earthly punishment equal to his crime. I believe no colours can paint the hue of his despondency. Exult then, my dear friend, that, amidst all your anxieties, guilt has no share; and if you can, on cool deliberation, fuppose that fate has made you unhappyy be thankful, at least, that destiny has not made you criminal.
t
To those who glide gently down the tranquil stream of life, remarks
of this sort might administer Small

event happens, your prelence here
will not be difpensed with.

having stopped her mouth and blind

and there she pasted a most uneasy night, regretting her Situation, and watering the bed with her tears. The next day she was obliged, by her rude conduistors, to make a long journey, through bye roads, and arrived that night at a house in a situation
more retired than the former. Here she understood that the next day’s stage was to be the last during her journey; she had attempted to
alarm the pastengers she Saw by

was suddenly indisposed, as it was said, and this occasioned a delay of fomc days, during which time she remained at the place 1 have mentioned, narrowly watched; and, having once made an attempt of escaping out of a window, the con feqiience was her being closely confined for the future; an old woman

THE EARL OF BELLGROVE TO MR.

Bellgrove place, Oflober
T T is with pleasure I inform you. Sir, that your daughter is here. Safe with us. I find you are already acquainted with the means : — and here we also have her deliverer, the
best, and most generous of men — a true hero; whose fortitude has worthily born him through all afstic tions; — One that,

228 THE triumphs
I had an hundred pardons to ask; an hundred apologies to make; but Sir Charles cut me Short, with the unseigned asturance of cordial friendship. Happy is it that he has Succeeded to a plentiful estate, of which, I doubt not, he will make the best use imaginable. His brother was on the point of marrying his own housekeeper and mistress, then with child by him, in order to Secure an heir; but he died; and, whether af fected by tidings of what must so much hurt her interest, or from some other cause. She has miscarried. The Baronet has used her with undeserved tenderness, and has provided for her during life. He is not a hypocrite,
but
  229
but the very pattern of virtue. They were the engines of his brother, who taught people (and me among the rest) to think otherwise, as John Seyward, one of them, but now a convert, will fully inform you. Sir frederic’s enmity was occasioned by, two circumstances, which redound to this gentleman’s honour (though he chose to keep them Secret), the one was, his having prevented him from debauching a poor girl in early youth; the other, his hindering this rapacious man from clandestinely posteffing himself of the person and fortune of an amiable young lady, to whom he had been chosen guardian. It was thus Sir Charles underwent
230
derwent a temjiorary Suffering for his virtues.
Nothing remains now, but that
9
he should present himself. Sir, before you and Mrs. Stanmore, with your daughter, whom he has So recently rescued from the power of a libertine; and I have the pleasure to acquaint you, that my Son is resolved
to decline all thoughts of miss Ca

roline, not from pique and resentment now, but from a conviction that Sir Charles, who has Suffered but too much, perhaps on account of our family, highly deserves her, and that she never can be happy with any other man. They were certainly made for each other, — May blefiings

MRS. SANDBY TO LADY BASIL.
November i6.
HE day before your letter reached me, my dear Lady basil (how happy am I, at last, to call you by that name), my felicity, as I hope, was insured. By the mutual consent of relations on both fides, Mr. Sandby and I were united, and exchanged those vows at the altar which are registered in heaven.

I am insormed that Holton lies ill, at his Seat at —, not of his wound, for that was a slight one, but of a cold he caught at a dance, which has been attended with a fever. It is Said, he was once So near death that he became a convert, through fear, to the doctrines of religion and morality.
On better principles have you ever believed them, and according to the

tenor of that belief has been your practice; — hence have you both en

countered difficulties with true he roism, and truly evinced that the force of fortitude triumphs over all temporal evils.
Be it our talk to follow Such examples! and let it be remembered, that a pattern of heroic virtue, in the midst of an age, perhaps as deficient in fortitude as in piety, was
fet by Sir Charles Basil and stie who was once known by the name of Caroline Stanmore.
