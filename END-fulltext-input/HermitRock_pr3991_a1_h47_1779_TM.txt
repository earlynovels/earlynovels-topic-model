l/tdy PRISCILLA BERTIE.
IN addrelting to Lady Pfilcilla Bertie the tranffa tion of a moral Sentimental novel, I Secure it a kind reception from the. world. That world which almost adores her, will, without consulering the merits or demerits of the piece, read it with e'a gerness, if the name of Priscilla Bertie adorns the Dedication.,
This, however. Madam, is not my motive for inscribing it to you — it is not the mere selfish hope of this piece meeting with favour from the san^i on of your name, that induces me to use it on this occasion. No — I have a far Superior reason. I admire your virtues ^i am charmed with your good sense— — see no young woman of fashion more estimable in any respeft, than the duchess of ancaster’s daughter. She is not only the greatest * beauty of our court — but, like her mother, she is I already famed for the amiableness of her condu6t.
[ I ambition that this work should be honoured by a) dedication of it to her, and I flatter myself she'will I not disdain to become its patroness.
1 I" a convent in Paris where I was educated— —; friend of mine determined to try her talent in this; Species of writing — neveir intending that it should; be made public. — When it was finished, she presented it to me — and 1 find myself now, by the most unfortunate of events, at liberty to publish it without giving offence to the amiable and beloved a writer of it.

In the course of the history, a few quotations were introduced by its writer from some French poets; but as they must have lost much of their beauty by a transtation, I thought it best to Substitute in their room Such as were equally applicable from engufa poets: a choice, I hope, your ladyship’s judgement will not condemn.
However this work may have Suffered in the transt.nion, there is a moral in it which may yet be found unhurt — and which is all, perhaps, that Can entitle it to your ladyship’s favour. Such as it is — I lay it at your feet,, and beg leave to subscribe myself

Victoria to Maria.
IT is done, my Maria — my word is irrevocably given — 1 have yielded to the commands of my father — to the too eloquent tears of my mother — and, on this day week, I am to be made the wife of lausanne. — Luzy I — most amiable — most charming Luzy I — Heaven can witness with what Sentiments of truth and love I consent to give you up for ever! — You will think I have wronged you — you will complain, with seeming justice on your Side; yet Vififcoria denies the accusation— — heart declares for yom, my Luzy — but her duty undoes us both.
My God! would he not pity me, could he behold me a trembling victim, led an offering to the altar of avarice? — Could he be a Spedlator of those tears — those agonies that must accompany me on
A 4 the

the day which yields me to the arms of Lausanne— — my Maria 1 — Luxy would no longer reproach me as the author of his wretchedness; he would let fall some drops of pity, and lament with me the austerity of fate.
You will chide me, Maria, when you read those impassioned lines — you will remind me of the rights that the Marquis will claim over me — you will tell me that I have assented to become his wife — and that Luzy must be thought of no more. Alas! you are right! — it will be a, crirhe to think — to Speak of him, when once I have given my hand to another. Butiah! allow me time to tear him from my idea — Suffer me, my Marla, to mention him before the fatal hour arrives, that is to place between us that cruel barrier, which will Separate us for ever. Deny me not the consolation of repealing his loved name, while yet I can do it with innocence. — be nqt too rigorous — I still prize rhy* virtue beyond my 16ve.
Do you remember when first I saw Luzy? — Do you remember the emotions which at that instant took possession of my bosom?? — knew not at the time what they meant — I had never experien ced them before — and ah, my Maria! I have never felt them since— — can I describe them?
^ *
— they were too violent to be delightful — they were too exquisite to be imagined.
Surprise — confusion— — — those were the most definable fensations — the rest must remain untold — my pen cannot do justice to them. Love for the first time presented itself before me — it rushed at once into my bosom: its approaches were violent, but it Soon wore a milder and more pleasing afpe^. This charming appearance captivated my reason; and bidding adieu to those tumults which had at the beginning affe6led me, I loved with pleasure, with gaity with composure. He looked
at

at me — he viewed me with attention — my fearful eye sunk under the piercing looks of lausanne, and blusbes overspread my face.
It was on a feast which my father annually gives his tenants, and which the young villagers call their rural ball. — Ah, I can never forget it! It was then I saw him — he was on a visst to Madame Du Parte— — came with her to join with us the happy throng. We were all habited like nymphs of Arcadia, and our dresses, my Maria, were emblems of our Simplicity. He approached me — he alked me to dance — I consented willingly — his manner was the tenderest — 'the most flattering — his eyes Spoke a language I did not then understand — but which even at that time was delightful, and from that night Luzy became anobjedf of my regard — * shall I say too much if I own, of my most ardent affediionp The chara6ler of the Comte was that of an amiable fensible man — his Spirit was generous; his soul was as noble as his birth; and his heart was extolled for its excellence.
Luzy was introduced my father by Madame Du Parte, as a young nobleman in whom the graces and virtues combined — as an obje6l: who had created not only the admiration, but the esteem op courts; and my father ever found.him a ssneere friend and most agreeable companion. I need not repeat more, my Maria — you know Luzy — you also know with what pains he undertook to make himself the conqueror of vifloria’s heart — ah, were not those pains rewarded! He stghed for me alone — he Seemed to regard me as the only being in the universe, who could give hstn happiness.. My father — my mother beheld and heard his pas sion for me and they encouraged him with every hope of success. The old Comte de Luzy resides in Italy, and the time drew near when his son’s presence there would be necessary. — At length'the

day was fixed for his leaving us — it came too foore — he was about to bid us farewell — ah, what anguish tore my fond bosom at the idea of parting with him! He fell at my feet — he once more painted to me the fincerlty — the fervency of his love. — I listenened — I wept — I wrung my hands.
“Ah!” cried he, “why ail this grief? — why these contending tumults?”
“It is past,, ” returned!, ** those hours of delight are past, my lu^y — and we shall behold them no more.”
My prophetic soul — yes, Maria,, my prophetie Soul whispered too truly the miseries 1 now feel. He bade me be of comfort — he swore to be faithful to me alone, and altured me his return should be as soon as postible. On my part — I vowed to love no other man — I' vowed no other should ever possess my hand; we called down heaven as a so» lernn witness of all we uttered. — That heaven now beholds me on the verge of breaking through those engagements which in its awful presence I had made. Ah, my father I — ah, my mother! why all this tyranny? Yon saw my affection for Luzy — you encouraged it — and yet you have doomed me to Self reproach — to misery— — Lausanne!' !'

I impart the fatal tidings to Luzy? — shouldt not justify myself to him? — Will he not hear it until he arrives in France? — My God, what will he think of me I — What will he not suppose!! — — my dear Maria — can there be a fate more wretched than, mine it Why was I not born the happy daughter of Some artless, some un aspiring villager 1 — then should: I have married the man of my choice — then would the glare of fuper iuous wealth have been disregarded by my parents, and the honest worth of my shepherd have been: the chief eonfideration. — But whither does my pen carry me H — ah, duty 1 — to thee I Sacrifice — to

Victoria to Maria.
Your letter, my Maria, afforded me Some
comfort; and the tears 1 shed upon it eased my heart, — One thing in it, I will own I thought Severe. When you tell me that I mujl learn to command those feelingsy which have hitherto rendered me too fenjible of pleafuxe and misfortune; you surely forget that I possess not your judgement — your firmness— — philosophy: ah, my friend I teach me to Subdue this weak — this repining nature point out to me those paths in which your virtues have led you; and lend me your Supporting hand to condu<st me through them. Teach me to forget the amiable — the Seducing Luzy — teach me to renounce those fond ideas which have hitherto formed the basts of my felicity — and ah! teach me how to honour — how to love the Marquis De lausanne! Good God; my Maria! — I feel that jhe tais too difficult. tomorrow— — t^ morrow I — my wretched destiny will be for ever Sealed! — No repentance — no appeal can then Save me — the irrevocable ceremony once passed — i am lost beyond redemption — father! — mother! to thy tenderness! — Alas, my Maria !' — the voice of nature pleads not for me — and Vitoria is sacri stced without one stgh!
The Marquis is here — I am momently persecuted by him to indulge him in an hour’s conversation alone. I evade it — I know, not how to re fuse a request which, if I loved him, I would with pleasure grant, — nor how to grant it — stnce I love

him not. Spare your chiding, Marla — to you only do I complain. -.
He is here — he taps at my door — ah, I must obey 1 — Miiji! — Is this the language for a man, whom to morrow’s fun will see me wedded to? — That thought — but he intreats — he pleads his impatience. — Once more do I resign my pen.
This man, my Maria, has endeavoured to daz^ zle my eyes with the Splendour of ornaments, which I equally detest and delpife. He presented me with his picture — and offered to tie it round my neck. I started at the proposal, and threw him from me with disdain. — The Marquis looked offended — he hemmed off a reproach — his cheeks glowed with resentment which he strove to conceal, by kissing my hand. — I flung myself into a chair — the tears fell plentifully from my eyesvyjhat a Scene I my father came in — he darted at me a look of anger. I arose — I trembled.

My Lord, ” cried I in a voice almost stifled with grief, “I have often told you, I have ncs heart to give — my duty will carry me to the altar wsth you — and my virtue will prevent me from breaking those engagements I shall make you there. — But oh! — would to heaven that Some other wo man, more deserving than myself, possessed those affections you lavish on me! — I am unworthy my

Begone

“Begone to your apartment, girl \” cried mj enraged father, is it thus you show your dutyp^
I retired — and am here Seated to lament — to corn" plain of my miserable fate to the only friend I have left.
The hurry — the perturbation — the joy that fills every eountenanee — shock me beyond description, — I view myself as an innocent vidbim they are preparing to lead to the temple of Some stvour ite deity, on a day devoted to festivity — I am to be decked with every gaudy flower of nature to make my bondage appear the more conspicuous — ■
I am to be led in golden bands to ruin — and made magnificently wretched. Ah, my Maria I — tomorrow — let tomorrow be marked down as the blackest day or fate! — it will be then — that Victoria shali resign Luxy — and give her hand to his proud — his happy rival!' — it will be then — that with the name of Clarence — she shall part with happiness for ever 1 — I am Summoned to attend my mother.
It is now past one o’clock — yet steep denies to visit my disconsolate couch — I will relate to you the occurrences that have happened Since I was interrupted Some hours ago : I must write to prevent my dwelling too minutely on the gloomy prospects which await your visforia — the Subjc^ — no matter what — but that v/hicli concerns me nearly, will, I am Sure, interest you more tham any other. I shall begin then from my appearing in my mother’s antechamber according to the orders she was pleased to Send me for that purpose.
On my entrance she kindly threw her arms a sound me, and inquired anxiousty about my health ___ with a Smiling countenance acted, whether I had chosen the ornaments best Suited to my complexion, from those that she had ordered to be

fore her — and begged her to inform me whether! could hope for no mitigation of my Sentence — and whether I was to be married to the man I detested? “Ah, Madam !’* continued her unlrappy child, “What do those ornaments you Speak of avail? — they can administer no cure fora wounded mind — they cannot bring peace to this wretched heart. Pardon me,, my dear mother — but my thoughts have been fardifferently employed Mchofe no Eowers — I would not look at the finery my v/o raan presented me with from Paris — they have no charms for me — 1 care not what doaths I wear on the most miserable day of my life.”
My mother wept; she Spoke of the marquis’s birth — his riches — his magnificence: she concluded by saying, that it was a match on which her fond heart was Set, and which the interruption ol would break into a thousand pieces. The very idea of my oecasioning her so much anguish shocked me to the Soul — my blood Seemed to congeal within my veins — I couldanswer nothing but my tears exprefsed the horror of my mind. My dear mother raised me from the ground and Seating: me by her, pressed me to her bosom. She talked much of the favour I should confer upon her and my father; she assured me that I should be happier than mv fearful heart presaged. She allowed the Marquis to have Some youthful follies, but was well assured that time, and my prudent conduct, would estrange him from them. My mother then painted the joy she should feel on Seeing me give my hand to a man of so much worth and taste; and the idea of rendering her satisfied, conr quered every Selfish sentiment' ' '
is done. Madam !•” cried I, I yield up liberty — happiness— — since my doing, so, can give you felicity : ah, my dear mother! I am ready to prefeiit my hand t the marquis — my life

shall be devoted to your pleasure — but’ hasten,. Madam, the marriage ceremony, and let me not restefil on what 1 have consented to.”
My mother looked delighted and rang her bell; she ordered an attendant to destre the Duke De Clarence and the Marquis De lausanne to enter : they obeyed the Summons, and on my mother’s telling my father that 1 was once again their childy he caught me in his arms, and poured forth a thousand thanks for tny having done what duty required of me. As for the Marquis — his raptures are not to be described;; Said many gallant things, and endeavoured to convince me by his eyes, that his heartfelt more than his tongue could utter. I strove to appear Satisfied — nay plea fed with these exprestiohs — but, ah, my God I — What were the pangs ray soul endured at the time! — £ perceived, my dear Maria, that my fate was determined — I therefore put a constraint upon those regrets which very often had nearly escaped hne. I shall become the wife of lausanne — that is inevitable : — my duty will soon oblige me to receive him with cheerfulness, and a look of pleasure. That thought occurred to me frequently during the evening — I therefore tried to appear complaisant to him from voluntary motives, before he should rested that the marriage ceremony alone entitled him to such behaviour — what it cost me, 1 will not say — but I listened to his love — I received his presents— — I suffered him to tie around my neck his piflure. — Oh, Luzy — Luz, y 1 — thy charming image! — but I will be myself — I will be boldly wretched — I will allow him to suspect me of inconstancy — of having betrayed him to his rival — of having preferred an additional few thousands, to a competency with him. — Ah, he will renounce me for .ever!! — will abhor my very idea — all this for duty I

I threw myfelpfei my bed for a few moments —
I endeavoured to compose my mind — it would not do — and I have again assumed my pen. Tell me, Maria — of what nature laufanne’s heart must be formed, to receive the hand of a woman whole affections he knows have been long engaged to another? — How can he condescend to be obliged to her duty, when he is convinced it is that alone ' that can, influence her kindness towards him? — If I mistake not, lausanne is imperious — indelicate — and his libertine principles are not the only bad onesl shall have to contend with. Oh, friend, — what a man have Host — how wfretched is my destiny 1 — but of that no more — I have promised to meet the hour from whence my misery will take its date — with calmness. Heaven grant, Maria, I may have fortitude Sufficient to keep that promise!
My mind is exceedingly disturbed — I hear strange noises— — thought the groans of a dying persbn sourfdbdms^er my wipdow — the weakness of my Spirits expose me to alarms. — I will say my prayers — I will beg of God to calm this tumult in his servant’s*bofom.

Ah, never! Maria — 1 left thee to pray — I had no Sooner finished my orisons, than an inclination, to steep came over my swollen eyes.
— I indulged it — and for thatpurpofe threw myself upon my, bed: I fell asleep— — oh,, my God! what a form presentcd itself to my fancy! — I beheld Luzy pale as death standing at my bedside.,., a poinard in his hand: — he opened wide the curtains — he looked wistfully at me, and pointed towards heaven.

‘‘ Nor Hymen,, nor the Graces here prestde.
Nor Juno to befriend the blooming bride.
But fiends with fun’ral bands the process led,
“And furies waited at the genial bed.”
NOW, my Miria, it is all over I yesterday I became the wife of Lausanne— — instead of feeling those Soft, those tender emotions, which would have posteffed me had I loved the Marquis k— — bosom was a chaos of horror,, confusioh, and despair.,
At ten o’clock in the morning I was dressed by the hands of my mother and my women for my appearance at chapel, where the ceremony of making me miserable was lo be performed. I did ^ not shed one tear during the businefs of the toilette — but I was extremely ill — I could hardly stand —
1 could with infinite difficulty keep my head from
falling

falling on my bosom. — I felt as if the whole world had abandoned The to destruction, and that my fond mother was the first to condemn her child to ruin. They adorned my hair with flowers— — braided it with strings of pearl : they put upon me an artois robe of satin— — mother clasped it with her own hands — my women praised my figure — my mother told me Lnever looked So handsome. I was filent — I was very — my heart' was bursting. When I was almost dressed, my mother looked at her watch; — a portrait of her friend Luzy, which he had presented her with, and which she always wore on its chain, struck my wretched eyes. — My Soul seemed to die within me, my liipbs denied their Support, and I fainted in the arms of Nannette. — I will be. less prolix, my Maria
After Some pains I was brought again te life : the hour was arrived which was to carry us to chapel. The carriages were in readiness— — Marquis came up to advertise us of his being all impatience, and that they waited to convey us to the sacred temple. As Soon aa he beheld me, he knelt and pressed my hand to his lips — ■! made him a refpe6lful — but a distant courtesy— — threw his arms round my waist; and whifperingly reproached me with my coldness. — I answered not — I hardly regarded what he had said— — thoughts were fixed on a far different — and, alas! — a far distant objeq:. — Pardon me, Maria! — I will endeavour to check that idea.
We were conducted to the saloon, where my father and. all the company were Seated. As Soon as I appeared, my father approached me with a joyful countenance, and a lively step he opened his arms to receive nae, I threw myself into them, and sunk upon his shoulder in a flood of tears: he kissed my cheek with fondness— — called me by a

thousand tender names — then presenting meto - each of my relations and those of lausanne’s who werepresent, he put my hand into the marquis’s, and blessed us audibly. lausanne I believe appeared handsome and graceful to every eye but V mine — his raptures were delicate and lively — and had my heart acknowledged him with pleasure I might in those moments have thought him charming. We soon after repaired to the chapel — my good father Francis pronounced the nuptial sbene dislion — he Seemed to regard me with an eye of tearful compassion — (for the humane and pious roan knows full well the Situation of his penitent’s heart) he uttered each prayer pertaining to the Sacred duties of matrimony, in a clear articulate voice, and with the most Solemn devotion. The Marquis appeared gay, gallant, and happy.: my father and mother looked cheerful and satisfied. As for my part — on standing up before the altar, my terrors are not to be described;; — faintness seized my heart — my eyes grew dim — and I was obliged to lean on my mother’s arm to Support me from falling during the ceremony. When it was finished ' — I voluntarily clasped my hands with fervour, and, looking up towards heaven I exclaimed,
“Ah, blessed .Dod! — it is indeed now done beyond redemption !” I was not myself at the instant, my dear Maria; my brain seemed to turn round — I was sensible of nothing but my misery, and forgot where 1 was, or who were present. To prevent me from saying more, the Marquis embraced me, and thanked heaven in a gay manner that it was indeed over, and that I was irrevocably ' his. This brought me to myself— — blushed for my imprudence, and sighed inwardly for my insensibility. The day was Spent in festivity by all but me — I strove to conceal my melancholy — but,
alas! I Succeeded not — and, ah! that I could draw
the
Hi
the dark veil of oblivion over that day for ever! — I can tell you no more, my Maria — only this —, that I am at present unhappy — but I will endeavour to make up my mind to be as contented as I can, by ailing through life with duty and obedience : my conscience at least will never add a sting to those painful refle6iions, which must at times obtrude; and if I am destined to be always miserable, the remembrance of my having conformed to the wishes of my parents, will in lome measure Sustain me from finking under calamity.
Adieu, my Maria 1 1 hope to have better accounts of the health of your mother: tell her, her child Vidloria kisses, in idea, those loved hands, which have so often Supported her in her infancy. To the Comtesse De Villeneauf, do I owe many of the happiest hours of my life; and for this valuable relation, and adopted.parent, do I profess the most entire respefit and affection. Tell her so, my Maria — and do you be assured, my more than Sister, my ever kind and dearest friend, that, in all Situations, I shall never cease to be,

I was shocked — I will own to you I was terrified; I knew not what ailed him — .and fearing that he was not well, I put my hand upon his arm, and inquired where was his pain? — Would you believe that this obsequious lover — threw from him with violence my hand, and answered, that I was his pains— — can I tell you wiiat I endured at that minute — no, it is impossible!! was the first time I had been used harshly by an V one but my father — and as F loved my father, I could more easily reconcile myself to his will: — But here! — yet 1 must forbear to declare my hatred to a man, wshom it is my duty to respeq:.

■ — I entreat your pardon but — your tears at leaving your father’s house (or rather at coming with me) stocked and grieved me — I resented it too haishly — but come! — you will confess I had rea son.” My answer was very full, and very. cool.

My life isatpresent a continual round of dissipation;
and without enjoying any of the pleasures which my husband gives into with avidity, I am obliged togo through them all at the expense of health — rest — and peace. v/hat a misfortune it is, my dear Maria, to be necelsitated to live with a person whole turn of mind — whose temper— — delights are So widely different! Our sbouse is crowded with the very best company in Paris it is true; but to have it always crowded, is terrible! The, Duke De Maurice is my shadow — he haunts me eternally. I am thought, it seems, a.beauty; and on that account 1 hear nothing but flattery. Can they suppose, my Maria, that a pretty face — that an elegant pcrson, can only belong to a fool? — If So, 1 am treated as I ought to be: — but if‘otherwisey why am I not Spoken to in a style, that my education would in ftrudf me to enjoy? 1 am heartily Sick of Paris, and all Shave Seen in it. Would I could stury myself in Some remote corner of France, “Forgetting and forgotten 1”
There is a Madame La Bert here, who is handsome, witty, and much admired. She has nothing that can recommend her in my eyes. Her wit is too gross for a delicate ear, and her vivacity borders on assurance. The Marquis is quite her cecisbeo, and she Seems to enjoy his assiduities. To be plain with you, my dear Maria, £ should be uneasy about their intimacy did Hove lausanne. As it is -- I can console myself but too easily— — say because, what I feel for hirn, is
not the affeslion I should feel for a husband.
The other night at a ball given by the Duke De Maurice, after having danced Some English dan

ces, I found the room in which I was, too warm; and taking Madame De sanscerre by the arm, we walked into an apartment which appeared cooler than the rest, from having, as we thought, no persons in it. We had not advanced many steps when I heard a female voice say, “Ah, Marquis! — should you ever give me reason to doubt your fidelity !’' — “Fear nothing, ” returned a man in well known accents, “you have charms Sufficient to attach me to you for ever.”
We proceeded quite into the room soon after this Speech, and I beheld the Marquis De Lau sahne, Seated by the handsorne La Bert; with one flier hands prelsed to his lips, whilst his arm encircled her waist as she Sat. I started on perceiving really that these lovers were two I had reason to know So well, but we retreated from the Scene, faster than we had approached it: their confusion was manifest, and 1 left them to recover of it, in whatever way they thought proper. Madame de sanscerre Seemed more shocked than myselst My Vifiloria, ” cried she, presting my hand, “that woman will be the ruin of your husband, if reason comes not to his aid.” I answcred not.
4 _
** Ah!” added my good friend, the Duke De Clarence has thrown away a pearl of inestimable wprth.” Madame De sanscerre applied her hand to her eyes. As for my part, my affliisfion was more intolerable when I gave him my hand, and found him an enraptured lover. I lamented now. the badness of his morals — but indeed, my dear Maria, Madame'la Bert I forgave with all my heart.
A greater mortification than this I endured fooii. after. The Duke De Maurice, Comte De Parte, the Chevalier De Mondonoir, Monsieur • Montville, Madame De sanscerre, two other ladies and myself, were standing up to dance,
'when

_ #
when a buz about the room of how handsome he ir! how elegant! what a man! reached our ^ ears -- and curiosity fuspended for a while our desire to begin the dance; it was however ungratisted till! we finished;; I law the Marquis de pal mean, introduce to the Duke De Maurice, the handsome Comte De Solignac; whom yoq may remember to have been luzy’s bosom friend. He had just left Italy, and parted with this friend. He arrived in Paris that morning, and the Marquis De Palmene brought him with him to this ball given by the most magnificent and elegant man in Paris. I stood near the Duke as he advanced. Ah, my God! — when I beheld him — what did £ not feel! shame— — — horror!! — looked at me — our eyes’ met — 1 threw mine down as conscious of guilt: he shortly after came up to me. ** Well, charming Vitoria !” cried he,
I congratulate you on your nuptials— — heard of them but this morning — the news had not arrived in Italy when I left it: alas! — I wish it had — I have an unfortunate friend there, madame, who will stand in need of Some consolation wlien he hears it.” During this Speech I had not courage to look at Solignac — my eyes were fixed on the ground, and tears fell from them in abundance. The Comte seemed almost as much affected as myself. He took my hand — he drew me apart from the rest of the company. ** How comes it, fair Vifloi ia, that those vows which you made Luzy, and which were registered in heaven, have been broken through by you with contempt — 'and Scattered to the winds? Ah, woman, woman added the gentle Solignac, “who can fathom the depth of thy distimulation — of thy profound art! who could Suppose that, in this too beauteous form, a false — nay! — a cruel heart was deposited I I am perhaps too warm! — but when I rested., B 3 upon
30
wpon the worth — the injured worth of ray Luzy — I cannot prpmife to Speak to you in the language of softness.” ' “My Lord, ” cried I, hurt at what he had Said, and covered with confusion“ “me not too rasblvr — tomorrow you shall receive a letter from me — my unhappy fate shall there be told. shall be explained too justly! Retire my Lord' — my emotion is observed — think better of me — and ah, remember, -, — I have a father whose commands are, absolute.” This, my Maria, I thought I owed to the re^itude of my own heart — to my long and sincere friendship for Solignac! j[ knew him when I had never seen Luzy — and luzy’s intimacy with him did not abate the ardour of my esteem for Solignac. — Oh! when I look
back -- -- pardon me! — I will not forget that I am
the wife of lausanne,
After Speaking to the Comte, I retired from the ball. My agitations were violent; my soul Seemed oppressed with a weight of woe — I threw myself into my carriage, and was brought home more dead than alive. Nannette, as she undressed me, often wiped away the torrents of tears that fell from my eyes, and the poor creature could Scarcely restrain her fobs: at that time I was almost in lensible of my sstuation — but reflection has Since painted it to me in its true colours. What could Nannette have supposed!! — no matter — Nannette, I fear, guesses too truly the cause of all my griefs.
jks Soon as I had dismissed my woman, I retired to my closet; and there penned the following billet tq the Comte.
To the Comte De Solignac.
WHAT can I say, my lord, in extenuation of a subject, that has been the cause of all my Sorrows,
f

.rows, without adfing inconsistently with that duty, to which I have So largely. Sacrificed? — my father — my husband — how will they appear to the amia able Solignac, if the daughter — the wife accuses them of cruelty and indelicacy? — ah, my Lord!
■ — that heaven which bore Solemn witneis to the vows I made Luzy, can justify me from the charge of falseness OF difsimulation — those vows are still inviolated by my heart — butmy filial — my trembling obedience Submitted to the harsh com mands of a parent — and I was dragged an unwilling, vi(stimto the altar with lausanne. What remains more for me to say? — nothing r but to affure you that though my poor heart rebels against this tyranny — my duty to the Marquis — the virtue of my soul will forbid me to behold again a man .whom I know to be too amiable — too eloquent for the repose of that peace, which my innocence alone can now ensure me. To God — and to you my friend, I hope I shall stand acquitted for my marriage with the Marquis. — and my determination never to see Luzy more — Alas, poor Luzy! — ray heart bleeds for the pangs, thou wilt endure, when thou hearest that Vlftoria has betrayed, thee to thy rival.! — Ah, my Lord,, could I add those pangs to the Sufferings that already corrode my bosom— — should not even sigh at my remembrance! Adieu, - amiable, generous Solignac! be ever assured of my.friendship,
After I had Sealed it I became more composed— —
had indeed owned to him, that the Marquis was not the objeck of shy choice; but I had sworn to respe£t him as my husband — to preserve towards him my fidelity; that thought gave me comfort, and I went to bed with more content than I had done for many nights. The next morning I dis patched Nannette with it to the Comte, and she brought me back these lines;

TOO amiable — too unfortunate vi£loria...i^ I feel your Sufferings, I applaud your virtue! so lignac weeps over your afbi(fiion, and in that one word, comprehends the everlasting despair of his friend. I will leave Paris — it is become odious to me. I can hear of nothing but the name of lau fanne, instead of that of Clarence. You are the admiration — the envy of this city. Beware of the Duke de Maurice!
'De Solignac.’*
** Beware of the Duke de Maurice !” repeated I to myself — yes, my good friend, I will beware of his art — of his flattery. At that moment, the Marquis entered my dressing room : I blusbed at his appearance, fori still held solig nac’s letter in my hand. The Marquis is a polite man, and a fashionable husband — he inquired gallantly about my health, and hoped all the bilietdoux I received were di£fated with alpthat elegancy my beauty had a right to cemmand. I jput the letter in my pocket, and assured him, I neither received, or wished to receive a bilietdoux. He Smiled, and, tapping my cheek, exclaimed, v/hat I — not from the Duke? I burst into tears — the mention of his name now alarmed me. “Ah, my Lord 1” cried I, ‘‘ I do not like the Duke — I detest Paris — Suffer me to retire for a little while to your seat at lausanne.” The Marquis hummed a tune— — — then looking at me kriousty, he exclaimed, “Why, madam, you are at liberty to go where you please— — not find it convenient myself to leave Paris — but that I am Sure will be no objection to your doing so. Adieu, my timid — pretty — prudent Marchioness— — care that the Sight of a bilietdoux does not throw you into an irrecoverable fit 1”
The Marquis left me in a state of mind — in a disposition of soul my pen would not, if it could,

SOLIGNAC,
I H AVE little to say to you, my friend — I have nothing more to do with the world. Vidoria De Clarence is married — my father last night breathed his last — there is no other circumstance that can affe6l me!
I shall call on you at Paris to take of you an pmt brace, that shall never more be repeated; I am unfit for Society — my Soul is torn with a thousand conflicting passions — I am wilder than madness itself— — am fiercer than a Savage 1 grief harmonises not my mind — it is all tumult, discord, and defpairl Oh Victoria! my Soft, my gentle mistress! — but I forget my injuries. — Solignac I am coming — meet me at palmene’s.

My name is the general topic of Paris, and
with it is joined that of the Duke De Maurice. My husband sees his attention — his assiduity to me — he encourages them by telling the
B 5 Duke
%
54
Duke in a half laughing strain, that perseverance alone can conquer my heart: he insults me after in a whisper, by prophesying his fuccess. Can a man be io lost to all sentiment— — — can he be So re gardless of his own honour, as to Suffer close stege to be made to his wife’s virtue? his horrible! £ treat the duke with a degree of coldness and reserve, which awes him into respefl — and the Marquis with an air of contempt which his folly and bis immoral; charaqier inspire. Ah, my Maria, can I help it? — It is in vain that I have sbewn lhusannne proofs of my obedience — it is in vain my having Seemed to regard him as my Lord and husband I lausanne is weak — is conceited — is wicked: the affection of a virtuous woman has no charms for him.; 1 am neglected whole weeks for a fet of wretches, whose very names carry with them an idea of infamy. His health — his fortune are yielded up to them, and he never returns to me,, but to enjoy, at the expense of ray peace, a constant round of company and disti pation at his own house.
At a Superb Supper given last night by Madame de sanscerre, the Duke De Maurice placed himself on one Side of me; and the elegant Marquis depalmene on the other. The Duke endeavoured to gain my attention by the most refined gallantry. The Marquis indeed possessed it, because I knew his flattery was merely assumed to prevent the dangerous Maurice from having opportunities of forwarding his Suit. The Duke looked chagrined at my preference of the Comte — Palmene regarded it not, but Seemed to increase in politeness, in wit, and pleasure.
You are a happy man. Marquis!” cried the jealous Maurice, on Seeing him fasten the bracelet which had slipped. And I am not infensible to my happineis, ” replied the gallant Palmene, and
carried
 5
carried my hand to his lips. The Duke arose— — was violently agitated — he walked from me to conceal his resentment — but returned Soon with a more placid countenance. He proposed vingt un,
I consented to make one, in order to engage him at cards, and to prevent his tormenting me with a conversation in itself too particular, and too gallant for a virtuous married woman to attend to, without an infringement on that line of delicacy which I have laid down as a rule for my conduct. We played — the party was large — 1 won at the beginning, but I got up a very considerable loser.
I lost to two English gentlemen in particular (strangers to me, whom I had never before Seen) fifty Louis — I had not io much about me. The Duke offered his purse ~l would not accept of it.
“My Lord, ” said I to one of those gentlemen,
“you do not leave Paris before tomorrow morning I hope!” He alured me that he Should not; but were he to do soit would be of no consequence- -- he returned, he would remember that the mar chionefs De Laujanne was his debtor, and he "Mould do himself the honour to remind her of it in ferfon.
I thanked him, but feeing at that moment the Marquis De Palmene, who approached and offered me the Sum, I accepted it, and discharged these debts of honour. The Duke was now absolutely in a rage — he looked sternly at the Marquis — he viewed me with an air of indignation : lie drew near, and whispered, “You have Suffered madam, in my esteem — you are lost in my opinion. If you prefer thajt odious figure, have delicacy Sufficient to keep your tasteless amour a Secret from the world. A lover’s purse you can use freely — That of a friend’s you discard.” ’
He paused for want of breath — his pastion deprived him of it. I assumed an air of chilling liaughtinefs — I arose from my seat — 1 turned full
uy n.
f
36
upon him — and with a look of mingled indignation and contempt exclaimed, Pray, my Lord, how long is it Since your grace has taken into your hands the reigns of my government? — I like no man as a lover but my husband — you least of all. I turned away. — My air — my manner froze him. He was struck into Silence. — He threw himself on a sopha that was near — while I slipped out of the room, and stepping into my carriage, I got home without enduring more either from his officious gallantry, or from hisinsulting jealousy. He has been twice here this morning — I have excused myself from feeing him. He is of all men the most dangerous — elfe why solignac’s caution! It has given me an aversion to the duke that is perhaps unjust — yet it is Safe, and I do not argue against it.
The Comte de Solignac, I find, has not left Paris — he came hither just now with Madame De Sanfcerre, who has pressed me to go with her tomorrow to her Chateau, which is fifteen miles from this city. I am to Spend with her three days that are, fly says, to be dedicated to friendship alone. From the bustle of Paris, my dear, ” Said sbe, pressing my hand, you will have leisure to recover those charming looks, which care and fatigue have cast a cloud over.” Madame De Sanfcerre viewed meat that moment with eyes of compassion. My husband’s libertine life is well known, and sbe pities me Sincerely. I promised to go with her. Solignac is to be with us.
The Marquis Le Lausanne left Paris Some days ago with Madame La Bert, and many others — they are gone on a party of pleasure. Poor Madame La Bert! — if sbe depends upon the fidelity of her lover, sbe will be too credulous; every pretty opera Singer in the metropolis can claim a title to his heart, by putting on a few of those artful blandisbrnents, which have often taken in unwary
4

wary youth. Lausanne is how ever old enough to see the fallacy of Such allurements — but his folly — or his love of the most unworthy of our Sex (which you please) is too powerful to suffer any motive whatever to withdraw him from them. He will not return I hope before my visit to Madame De Sanfcerre has been paid. If he should, I shall be upbraided for being out of the way when his company ought to be received. I am unhappy, my dear Maria — Indeed I am 1 and where is the balm that can relieve xny distempered soul? — Ah, Luzy, Luzy! — had fate permitted —
You may perceive I give into amusements — you may also perceive I Suffer the most trifling subjects to engross my pen. — I stng — I talk — I dance — it is all in vain, believe me. The image of Luzy is ever present to my view, is ever prefentdn my heart. — After Spending nights of the utmost inquietude — after wandering with him in terrific dreams, amidst Scenes of blood and horror — arise— — hasten on a dishabille — 1 fly to chapel — I prostrate myself at the foot of the sacred altar — I entreat for patience, resignation and fortitude to o vercome a passion that became ■ criminal when I married his rival. — Ah, my Maria! — does my God abandon me? — elfe, why when I rise from my knees does my heart still warmly beat — still heave Some Sighs of regret for the amiable — the lost Luzy? — My loved Luzy — if I may yet dare to call thee So — think not too harshly of me, — Remember that you have often told me, “One ads of filial obedience, was worth more in the sight of heaven, than almost any Sacrifice whatever.” Behold then — in this one adt — I Sacrificed that to duty, which was dearer to me than life itself— — to resign Luzy for ever |
I will write no more ’till I arrive at Madame De sanfcerre’s; my Spirits are fluttered — my fears
bode
38
. bode ten thousand evils. The Duke De Maurice persecutes me — The Chevalier De Mondonoir sends every hour a billet-doux to my door. I regret that I am handsome — 'I bewail over my beauty — it has been productive of the greatest misfortunes of my life.
Ah, my Maria! — I have a strange fceneto unfold — my hand is unsteady — my heart is bursting. — I write from Madame De sanscerre’s.
To what purpose are we given these refined feelings — these delicate organs, but to make us unhappy! — My Maria, why did I not behold him, whom my foist loveth, without agitation — without Such exquisite emotions as deprived me of utterance? — Oh, I gave myself up to them! — I for same moments permitted my heart to forget that Lausanne possessed a fatal marriage vow, which was most Solemnly ratified in heaven — and that,, that vaw was made to him by me. — But I will explain the matter — you are tortured by suspence.
Madame De sanscerre and Soligniic called for me yesterday morning before Seven o’clock in her post coach, and we Set off immediately for this elegant and beautiful spot, which Madame De sanscerre adorns with every charm of nature. Our journey was Swift, gay, and happy. wear rived about nine o’clock at the end of it, and the remainder of the day was Spent in a manner the most agreeable that could be devised. We read — — we walked — we played on the Softest instruments, and our voices aided the harmony of those sounds, which we drew from our lutes. Solignac was quite himself, and Madame De Sanfcerre lost not, for one moment, her charming and delicate vivacity. Towards the dusk of the evening, she proposed that we should, visit her temple consecrated to Dianna. It was situated in the thickest part of a delightful wood, about a mile from the
. house.
f

house. Its stru6l: ure without V as magnificent, and it was fitted up with every charm of elegant Simplicity. Upon the top glittered a resplendant crelcent, and upon the door were these words inscribed :
Traveller, enter without fear.
Innocence, Chastity and Virtue,
Here reside.”
We entered — refreshments were prepared — but we Saw not a soul — everything transporting — and seemed to have been executed by Some invisible. Some magical hand. Solignac took a German flute that lay near — Madame De sanscerre accompanied it with her voice. The moon now began to as fume its empire over the night, and with its clear and Soft refulgency darted its rays upon the Temple. I was affebied — my bosom beat with the most delightful sensations. The beauty of the night — the tranquillity that reigned throughout — but most of all, the harmony of the sounds which sanscerre and Solignac filled the room with, occasioned I know not what in my soul, and I burst into a flood of tears — - Solignac arose, and took hold of my hand.
Charming vi^ioria, ” cried he with emotion, your gentle breast acknowledges the power of virtuous lensibility. 1 have one favour to ask of you, which if I thought it were incompatible with your delicacy, your honour, I would not make.’^ Madame De sanscerre, at that instant, wiped away Some, drops that fell from her eyes, and bade me be assured of her prudence — of her regard for my reputation.
I was alarmed at this Serious introdu6iion — II begged of them to Speak; and earnestly inquired what they would have me do?
My.
A
y

My friend Luzy, ” replied Solignac (I trembled at the name) “my friend Luzy is about to leave France for ever — he is nowhere — he wishes to bid you an eternal adieu. He has lost his father; he has lost his Vi; oria; what then has the world in store which he can prize! — Dejeffed — despairing — miserable — he intreats you lo admit once more him to your presence — to Suffer him at your feet to pour out a prayer for your repose. Yet — if you consent not. — if you can doubt of the purity of those Sentiments which you have known So long — if you can fuspedt his honour ■ — he will never Seek this last, this poor atonement — he will quit France — he will leave Madame De sanscerre’s house, without daring to intrude into your presence. Luzy, without one ssngle comfort — will bury himself for ever in some obscure corner of the globe — far remote from the Society of all he holds dear.”
He paused: Solignac applied his handkerchief to his eyes — he was much agitated. Madame De sanscerre took my hand.
Would r, do you think my Victoria, ” Said file, “make any request to you, that could be derogatory to your virtue? — God forbid! — I have ever been your friend — nor would I have made you this entreaty, but that I have beheld the altered unhappy object of rny pity. He leaves France tomorrow— — embarks for Martinico — we shall nevermore behold him. refuse him not the only gleam of consolation yet remaining — a last sigh breathed before you -* a last look towards the centre of his happjness.”
Madame De sanscerre wept bitterly — T continued motionless— — was in the most dreadful perplexity.
“Ah, my friends !” I at length exclaimed, let not your pity for Luzy involve me in the
'*
9
%
OF THE R O C K. 41
reflection of having acted inconsistently with those delicate Sentiments which lausanne has a right to claim from me. — If I behold Luzy — w ill not some rebellious wishes— — not feme regrets take poflellion of me? Ah! added I, at the same time throwing myself into the arms of Madame De sanscerre, “Save me from deviating, even in idea, from the duty of my marriage vow.’*
A voice — a well known voice, at that moment, iltued from a distant part of the Temple, and pronounced these words : “Solignac — I charge thee press her no farther; — perhaps she is right 1 tell her, Luzy will bless her to the latest minute of his life.”
I started from the arms of my friend — I clasped my hands together with fervour, and fell fenselefs on my knees — what became of me for a short while I know not — but when I recovered, I found myself on a sopha near the window, and my two friends leaning anxiously over me.
“Fear nothings Madam,"" cried Solignac,
** you shall not be longer perfecuted. ^the poof wretch was detained by me till this night, in hopes of feeing you. Forgive therefore his presumption, Since 1 alone was the cause of it, and forget him for ever, who has hopelefsly aspired to your friendship. Come, Nqharming Vidloria, possess yourself: think no mdre of this interruption of our happiness — Luzy will leave — nay, is perhaps gone by this time, and your delicate virtue vrill no longer be endangered.”
** Cruel Solignac! exclaimed I with heartrending Sorrow. “Cruel Solignac!” and my tears told all.
“Grieve no more, my dear viqioria, ” said Madame De sanscerre; “If you choosc to bid Luzy adieu, he shall be summoned instantly — If
you

*
• you do not— — no more of this unlucky scheme, and perplex yourself no further.”
I paused a few moments — I arose from the sopha— — walked up and down the room in some coa fusion — at length the reflection of the wrongs I had done him, jusbed at once into my mind, and the cruelty of prohibiting him this trifling recom pence shocked me. — I endeavoured to prepare my soul to receive him — 1 resolved to behold him as my friend,, and to banish the idea of lover.
‘‘ There is nothing more to be considered, ^ cried I; “theconflidl is over. Tell your friend, my Lord, that I am willing to. see him — that I desire to exculpate that part of my conduct towards him, which he may fuppose to have been injurious.. conscious of my own innocence in afseming to this interview 1 will venture for once to al cobtrary to.my opinion.” '
Solignac staid only to kifs my hand — he was out of the room the instant after.
And now, my Maria, ..you will remember those refoultionsi had made. — thoferefotuuom weak Supports! — They deserted me at the time in which I most stood in need of their assistance.
Soon after solignac’s departure from the apart .ment where we were, a sort of scene drew back, and discovered a well illuminated faldon. We walked into it, and it do fed again behind us — I was Sadly fluttered — I appeared as if I had gone into Some enchanted castle — the genius of it I knew to be virtue — and with her I could not fear : — however, my Spirits Sunk, and I threw rayfelf breathless into a chair. At length the door opened
— Solignac entered — and after him -- -- - ah,
my God, it was Luzy indeed! — I arose at their entrance — I involuntarily clasped my hands together — my knees trembled — I was ready to saint, luz.y approached me with respect— — bowed in
■ sslence

silence before me, and big tears ran down his manly face. Madame De sanfcerre’s sobs were audible — and sbe quittedtheroom to conquer them. The Comte De Solignac retired to a window with his back turned towards us. We stood up, my Maria — our eyes fixed on each other — tears were all the eloquence we used — and Surely they told more than all the language in the world could have exprested! After some minutes I endeavoured to Speak.
My Lord — my Lord, ” — cried I — — I could go no farther — the sound died upon my lips. He threw himself at my feet. In that one minute, my Maria, I forgot my vows at the altar — 1 beheld Luzy as the object of my most ardent love — as the Lord .of allmy wishes— — sunk upon his bosom in a flood of grief — ■ he clasped me in his arms — our Sighs — our sobs — our tears were intermingled. At last I began to refle6; (though in the embrace of Luzy) that I owed to the Marquis De lau fanne a far different condtldl — that my duty, my delicacy — should forbid me to indulge Luzy in shch proofs of tenderness. That notion sufficed— — disengaged myself from his arms, and strove to assume a more composed, a more determined air. Luzy forgot not, for an instant, the refpedf due to my charadier' — due to my virtue — he suffered me to quit his embrace — and kissed my hand as a proof of his obedience.
My Lord, ” cried I with a voice almost inarticulate, ‘‘ you see before you an unhappy weak woman. — After what has passed, I need not say, that you are, and ever will be the object of my af fedfion. — A father’s stern commands — a husband’s rights, have rendered this passion no longer innocent — I must endeavour to Subdue it — I must resolve to behold you no more. Farewell, too amiable Luzy !” assded I, almost stifled with

my Sorrow, ‘‘ forget, renounce me for ever!’^ — Luzy once more threw his arms arou!^d me.
“Renounce you !” exclaimed he, “ah, teach me how! and he pressed me to his bosom“ “you !” After Some moments pause“ “that hour be my last! — No, most adored Victoria, I will only promise that which I know I can perform — I consent to banissi myielf for ever from your Sight — will that Satisfy your .cruelty? — will that content your inexorable virtue?” — I wept — • he went on. — “Every moment that I stay is bliss — but that dreadful one must arrive at last, which will for ever Separate us! — I promised only a few fleeting minutes to trouble you — I will keep to my word — I will tear myself from thee.” — He pressed me faster in his arms. — Victoria, ” cried he, ** Adieu I” — yet still he motioned not to depart, — One last kifs!” added he — and he took a thousand— — was now, my dear Maria, that I felt the imprudence of my behaviour — I told Luzy that I did feel it, and that his absence was now absolutely necessary. — He arose— — begged me to pardon him — he kneeled again, and implored from heaven its choicest blessings on me.
** Well, Madam, ” cried he with a tremulous and Sorrowful accent, “you now behold me about to take of you an everlasting adieu. — tomorrow I embark for Martinico — tomorrow, dear Victoria” — and he pressed my hand to his heart, — ** tomorrow will be the last day which will see me in France !’*
Luzy, ” replied I, in an agony of grief, our cruel fate commands of us this Separation. I will not dissuade you from your purpose, but will endeavour to imitate your virtue. Adieu, my best, my dearest friend!” and I threw myself into
his arms; “adieu for ever; viftoria’s heart may

After many embraces— — a torrent of tears — and a tempest of sighs— — tore ourselves from each other — Solignac condudied his friend from my sight — and Madame De sansccrre hastened to relieve my anguish. When I beheld her, I wrung my hands in Silence — I wept upon her bosom — ■ Madame De sanscerre talked me into composure — and reasoned — and Sympathised with me by turns. Soon after Solignac came back with tearful eyes, and informed us that the Marquis De pal mean and Luzy had Set off for Bordeaux that moment, from whence Luzy was to embark on the stormy ocean Ah, Heaven, — ah, blessed God be his protedtionl — what will become of me, if through my unhappy fate he should be lost? — • ah, horrid idea! — cruel Suggestion I
And now, my dear Maria, what will you think of me? — what will you say to all this? — you will call my behaviour weak — you may perhaps think me wanting in delicacy — do not fuppose the latter — I could not bear that you should hold me deficient in the greatest charm of woman. — Put your fdf into my Situation, imagine that you behold Lindor, a despairing lover, undone by your cruelty. — Your Senlible heart would reach to him a hand of pity — a gleam of comfort — Surely that would not be incompatible with innocence I — if it is — how lost is your Victoria!

I walk towards that fatal Temple, and behold him, in idea, whom my Soul loveth. — I hear his voice in every wind — I hear his step in the rustling of every leaf — this place nourishes this destru(sive poison — I must fly from it — yet whither shall I fly? — ah, my God, is it to the house of Laufannc?

Victoria to Maria.
r
IINDOR presented me with your letter yester a day, my dear Miiria. ‘all that I can say in answer to it is, that your friendship is my greatest blessing, and that your part of a censor, takes not from you that of indulgei*ce and humanity. At the moment you point out a folly, you soften it' by your pity; and show, by your judgement, how to redfify it. I rejoice that I postess such a friend as my Maria, and while heaven will Spare her to me, I cannot be totally unhappy.
When Lindor was presented to ’me, I was immersed in a crowd — our house was full bf company. He approached me' - with all that grace and elegance So naturahtb him but what was above all, with a look of fensibility in which I read his pity for your friend. My affection for Lindor, was always great — buti thought I never loved him morethan at that instant. 'The marquisde L.'V.
-- — ‘attended him'to me, and told me in a whisper! that his friend Lindor, he perceived, was too much affebled to Speak, but that in the course of the evening, he hoped I would give him an opportunity of saying a few words to me. I was distressed myself— — with a nod of approbation I Signified .an assent to do So. I took care to do as he wished, and, in about an hour after his entrance. I walked with him into another apartment, which I thought more private than it proved to be. As loon as we were alone, the amiable Lindor embraced me, and without uttering a Syllable, burst into tears; mine flowed plentifully upon his shoulder, and sighs of distress, broke from my oppressed heart. After a pause of Some moments, he told me, in an almost inarticulate voice, that he had left my Maria well, that he had a lettersor

. me, which he would not delay to give me — but that he was too much overpowered with a thousand conflifling ideas at that time, to render his stay with me either delightful or proper; and presenting me with your letter, he bowed, and was about to depart, when I called after him to appoint a time for my feeing him without interruption. — He proposed the following etening at ray own house— — to it, and he took his leave.
As Soon as Lindor was gone, I threw myself into a chair, and without breaking the Seal of your packet, I kissed it with fervour.
“Dear loved hand!” cried I, as I held it to my lips — “thou wilt tell me all — thou wilt Speak wisdom to my heart — thou only canst lead me to the path of happiness— — unerring didlates will I follow — thy courageous precepts learn and practice.”
I
At these words I was about to break the feal, when I beheld the Duke De Maurice before me. He viewed me with an eye of levity and contempt; his attitude was familiar, and the words he dared to pronounoe were still more so.
“Ah, charming Marchioness— — congratulate you on your change of disposition— — was a time when mountain Snows were not more cold or chaste — when that fair bosom was impregnant to love — and those too beauteous lips announced thy cruelties alone. Now it is far otherwise — every pretty fellow can claim from thee a languisbing Smile, a tender look — but one more hapyy than the rest, can press thee in his arms — can drink thy falling tears — can fix an hour to meet thee in Secret — and can present you with an amorous bil letdoux, to contemplate during the tedious minutes of his absence. — Ah, happy man !” added Maurice, and he fell on one knee before me. “Ah, happy man !” he attempted to kifs my hands. I started from my Seat.
“My

My Lord, ” cried I, almost choked with indignation, how dare you intrude thus upon my Solitude! — I am not the guilty wretch thy poison ous breath would taint me with the name of. — ■
That man is a near relation — that man is a friend whom I esteem. — This letter is from a female — it comes from the daughter of Madame De ville neauf. “Begone, ” continued I, looking at him with a degree of haughtiness I did not think myself polfeffed of, “begone, my Lord, and'never see me more!” I was about to fly the apartment - — but the insolent wretch caught hold of my hand.
consider, fair marchioness, ” cried he,
“that you are now in my power : I have proofs that would for ever blast your fame. — You carry on the matter bravely. — You are pleased to call my breath a poisonous one : — take care, lovely Vidforia, that you do not find it So 1 — take care that this breath taints not your fair name— — rather let it utter the Softest accents of love! rather let it infuse into thy Soul a degree of pity for
him, who lives but to adore you -- who exists
but in the hope, that you will not for ever despisc
• his pafllon — his unshaken constancy!”
During the latter end of this Speech, the Duke threw into his eyes all the Softneis of that pafllon, for which he pleaded; his fine teeth and well turned mouth, were shown to the highest advant, age. His elegant form was Supported by a large Corinthian pillar well lighted, and though he held me, and that by force, his figure appeared easy, tender, and beseeching. At that time I was rea liy
• So much enraged, that he seemed to me a hideous monster. Sent into the world only to heighten my torments. Reflection, however, in a cooler moment, has shown him to me. Such as he really would have been thought by most other women, a graceful and Seducing lover.

“My Lord, ” replied I in as cool a manner ai I could affnme, “the insults I endure from you., are really intolerable, and become more frecjuent every day. If, however, you dare to mention to me again a Subjebl which my duty forbids me to listen to, I will, at all risks, complain of it to the Marquis De lausanne.”
By heavens, ” returned he, “you may publish it to the whole world!! is not the only Sword 1 would engage with, for such apprise. — No, Madam, if every hand was armed to pro tedf you from me, my love should find you out, and offer itself a panting victim at your feet.”
1 was now provoked beyond all patience — I beheld the Duke De Maurice in a light too odious to describe. I perceived his Scheme was to terrify me, with the loss of character, if I did hot actually con Sent to deserve that it should be blasted by listening to his addresses. My pride — my virtue resented Such vile treatment, and, breaking from him with infinite anger and disdain, I bade him to beware of insulting the daughter of the Duke De Clarence — of insulting the wife of the Marquis De lausanne — but most of all to beware of exposing his own vanity to a declaration from me, which would at once convince him, that I saw through his artifices, and despised his character. Saying this, I quitted the room with perturbation iind disquiet.
I Soon after joined the company who were at cards in the saloon, and as I leaned over the chair of Madame De Sanfeerre, observing her play, the Duke De Maurice approached my ear.
‘‘ You are licensed. Madam, to treat me as you think proper — .from your lips I can bear e very thing they choose to instifl; — but let me caution you against beholding more that minion of your favours, — he may enter your house alive, but by heaven he shall never leave it in Safety 1”

OF T H E R O C K. 51
To this insolence of the Duke, I made no reply, and affected to have given it no attention; I however dispatched an excuse this morning to Lindor, for not Seeing him as I had promised, but begged of him to meet me at chapel, tomorrow morning at eight o’clock; where I must frame Some apology to him, for not receiving him at my house during his short stay at Paris. Unhappy fate how can I extricate myself from the difficulties that Surround me?
This affair has really so discomposed me, that I have not had leisure to reflect on my other misfortunes. Ah, lu^y! — where ever thou goest — in whatever dangers thou art immersed — by what perils surrounded— — vigoria — thy tender, thy constant viuoria will vistt thee in idea — will share thy Sorrows — will wish them all her own 1
Adieu, my Maria — •you must plead for me to Lindor when you see him — let him not know the truth — hut, ahl~let him not think that I can love him less — that I can evernegledt the friend of my earliest days — bid him be assured of my most unchangeable affection.

Victoria to Maria.
TFIE veil of politeness which the Marquis De
lausanne once alsumed, has of late been entirely thrown off, and he is now either Sullen •and abrupt, or harsh and petulant. His pleasures (alas, my friend! should that name be given to libertinism?) absorb him wholly, and I have drawn
C 2 on
V
t
/
on me the most violent indignation for daring to
D C
remonstrate with him on his manner of living. —
I urged the preservation of his health, if he disregarded every other consideration; but 1 was Soon made sbnsible that weak minds are always the most offended by advice. That remark I have often heard ou make — the truth of it, however, Ihave learned by experience.
Madame La Bert postestes him entirely; sbe is too abandoned by every moral principle, to regard the cenlures that are hourly thrown upon her. — They are become the topic of Paris, and their names are never mentioned but with Satire and contempt. As for my part, 'my dear maria, his politeness was alii desired — was all that was necessary towards making me not quite miserable — and even that L am now deprived of.
lausarrne plays — plays high — and as his (kill is not equal to his love of gaming, he loses incredible Sums, Madame La Bert has drawn him into this new vice — he liked it not, till he became her stave.
1 certainly was not totally unfortunate while he neither troubled me with his caresses, nor shocked me by reproach. — It is now far otherwise — he never Sees me, but he assumes a countenance almost terrific — nor ever Speaks but to distress my sensibi ^ lity. I beggedleave, yesterday, to retire to lausanne;; I was peremptorily refused — he desired me to like the place which contained him; and if I did not know how, he would advise me to learn; for I should not go without him; and he did not intend to leave Paris for Some time. I will make; no comments upon this fpeech.i — you are more at ’ liberty on this occasion, and you can judge of what I felt, better than my pen can describe.
The Duke De Maurice follows me like my shadow — 1 treat him almost ill — I never fpeakto him, but when the strictest rules of politeness oblige n e

to it. Notwithstanding which, he is a constant attendant at mv parties — he is an eternal Spy upon my afbons. The other day I met him at the Marchioneis De sauverre’s, _ I had just returned from the Bois de Bologne, wsbere I had attended the court on a hunting party, and was still in’ my riding dress when I called upon the marchioness. The Duke in a whisper congratulated me on the favour 1 enjoyed at Veriailles, talked much in the praise of the king’s judgement, and concluded by alking,.. whether 1 remembered the story of La va liere? My having admired the king’s person, and acknowledged that I did, together with my attendance about the Comteffe De Artois, brought on me this sarcasm of the duke’s, to which you may Suppose 1 made no reply,, but by look expressive of my contempt.
I see the Comte De Solignac frequently — I fear not to unbosom myself to him — he counsels — he directs me in the paths I should walk, in order to shun the wiles of the Duke De Maurice, but, believe me, I say nothing of the treatment I receive from Lausanne. Weak as my conduct might have appeared to you in my last Scene with Luzy, I am cautious of mentioning his name to any one but you, and my repel towards my husband seems to increase in the eye of every bye stander. Solignac appears to imagine that I love him. — Solignac cannot really think So : but he is all delicacy. As for Madame De sanscerre, she is with me constantly, and Sees more of the marquis’s behaviour thrtn I Could wish should be expbied even to her. I often Surprise her in tears, after anything has happened that manifests either his folly or ill humour. She is a valuable friend, and I love her Suicerely Adieu, my Maria!

Victoria to Maria.
I HAVE just received a Summons to attend my dear mother who is very ill. The Marquis is ' Jiot in Paris — he is with Madame La Bert in Flanders. — I shall go, however, though his anger should be the consequence. The carriages are getting ready to convey us to Clarence. Madame De sanscerre accompanies me. I will finish my
letter when I arrive at my father’s.

C L A R E N C E.
A H, my God, Marla! — what will become of me 1 — my mother — my dear mother is dangerousty ill indeed! she hardly knows her Victoria, although I have wept over, and kissed her just lifeless hands. She looked steadfastly at me for Some minutes, but turned from me after, without emotion. I cannot proceed — I am too much affesled — t will describe my arrival Some other time.
As Soon as I came within view of Clarence, my i'.eart Seemed to die within me — anxious rs I had been for revisiting this Scene of my happiest days, the miseries I had latterly experienced here, obliterated all remembrance of former pleasures, and I beheld it as the monument of my infidelity to l uizy, A fatal presenfion too, Seixed my soul. — The hope of rushing into my parents arms would have been lome fatisfaflion but, alas! my mind foreboded that I should find my father only sensible of my approach. At this idea, my tears flowed
in

in abundance, and I shed them in the bosom of Madame Pe Sanfcerre, As 1 entered the gates, I perceived the domestics who waited at theni mournful and pensive : they however, as I pasted, hailed my arrival with Some faint demonstrations of joy. When I stepped out of the carriage, all the Servants blested me with tears, and called me the comfort of their future days. As I stood amongst them, my father graciousty came out to meet me; his step was Solemn, — his countenance Severe and melancholy. Lhrew myself at his feet,, and clasped his knees. He raised me with Some tenderness, and Supported me to his study. — When we got there, I inquired immediately for my mother.
Sit down, girl, ” cried my father, I will tell you preseqtly.” Madame De Sanfcerre and F Seated ourselves; and my father, after wiping off some tears that fell from his eyes, thus proceeded : “You will find your mother in that trying Situation which calls for fortitude to Support — She is hastening to a better life, and will sooner reach the goal t han will your father. — Victoria, ” added he with a stern vpice, ** visloria, ” -. — and the sound died away upon his lips. — I arose to take his hand, — but he pointed once more to the seat, which I bad quitted.
“Stay, ” cried he, ** I will Speak prefently.’^ — and my father leaned his face upon his arm to hide his grief. — As Soon as he had a little recovered, he went on.
VI Gloria, there is but one adkion of your mother” s life of which sbe repents — and that is — her having been accestary to your marrying a man you did not love” — here his voice faltered a^aln

My father anxiously waited for my reply. ~ Something arole in my bosom that prevented articulation — -1 could not Speak. — I again quitted my seat, and threw myself on my knees before him. Are you not happy ?” repeated my father. ** Oh! yes, yes, Sir, ” answered I, “happy if my being so, can make my mother live — can make my father easy” ” a violent gush of woe hindered my saying more. My father railed me to his arms.
“These tears, viq^oria I — .ah, why these tears? — your friend, too !.ah, Madame, ” cried he, taking the hand of Madame De Sanfcerre, explain why these tears should be such rea dy comers, if her husband treats her as my fond wishes hope?” '
Madame De Sanfcerre replied not but by a shrug cf her shoulders, and an averted face. My father quitted his seat abruptly. ^
“By heaven, ” exclaimed he, “she Is miserable!! — that by my cruelty!” — At these words, he left the room in an agony of passion. Some minutes after, my mother’s woman came

to tell me that she was awake, and had inquired if I was come — This was sufficient— — I hastened to her chamber. As Soon as I entered, I perceived her Sitting up in her bed, assisted by pillows • — her dear revered face — ah, my Maria, how altered! — it was pale and melancholy. Her head was Supported by one hand, and her eyes fixed upon a picture of the blessed Virgin, which lhe held in the other. When I beheld her reverend form, I flew to the bedside, and threw myself on my knees before her in a flood of anguish. My mother turned her eyes from the picture, and placed them on me: my tears fell upon the hand I had, Seized, and I called upon her by the names of mother

My agitations obliged me to leave the apartment, lest my Sobs should have disturbed her repose. It was in that interval 1 writ the strsr few lines dated from hence. When I laid down my pen, I stole Softly into my mother’s room, anti took my seat at the foot of her bed. She did not awake for Some hours, nor could I be prevailed on to leave her. When sbe stirred, I advanced towards her, and alked her if sbe knew me? — Sue looked at me steadfastly.
Yes, yes, ” — sbe cried, “it is the well known form of my injured child! if thou art really her, ” added sbe, in a feeble tone, “ah forgive me for the only al of unkindness I ever forced on you! — If thou art but her shade— — me not with her wrongs — for my victoria’s self would treat me with greater lenity. Ah, my God!” continued sbe clasping her hands together. “Ah, my God I what a'sacrifice did stie make to duty — did duty exact from her? Victoria— — 1” sbe exclaimed, and' again sunk, on her piilow — I threw myself, on the bed and: wept aloud.
“Ah, my mother! — you never injured me — ■ you were always gdod to your Victoria — you iiave made her happy — .and sbe comes to bless you for it. — Think no more of the Sacrifice you mentioned — it was only a momentary struggle ^it is now over, and I regret it no further.”
My mother once more railed herself in her bed, sbe listened to me with the most cautious attention — her features brightened as I Spoke, — a gentle
glow overspread her dying face.

My dear mother from that moment, my Maria, has been herself no longer: a fatal stupor, wiiich belpeakes the approach of death, hath fastened on her, and sbe is at once regardless of hus' ' child, and friend. I have quitted her chamber for a few minutes to conquer the extreme force of my affliction, which Seems to disturb my father’s Silent and awfful Sorrow.

She embraced Madame De eausanne with much affection— — held before her, the pictures of the Comte pe Luzy, and that of our immaculate
Lady.
** Here, rpy daughter, '” cried jsbe, at the moment I offer you the portrait of a lover, 1 pr, e fent you with that of chastity itielst Let your friendship astne be given to the first — but let your whole heart be devoted to the other, — These” ” she, “are faint resemblances of what we love — of what we revere — but they Serve to remind us — that Luzy was the most amiable, of all ’ lovers — that the Virgin Mary was the most pure of all women.”
She then prayed fervently for she happlnefs, for the preservation of lier daughter’s virtue; and throwing herself into her arms, leaned her head upon her bosom, and breathed her last Sigh, without a groan — without one struggle.

The poor man, insensible to everything but the injury he has done her, and the horror of death; loses, in afking her pardon, those moments in which, by an upright resignation to the will of heaven, he could astist her ycath by offering her the Supporting advice of a dying parent. The Duke De Clarence is, I fear, drawing very near his end, and in that rhinute of distress, sbe will in fal lose the only friend of whom the Marquis De lausanne stands in awe.

I AM but just recovered from a severe illness which has confined me six weeks. Death has been very busy about me for Some time past — he has at length (pared the only object that 1 could have wished him to have taken, and instead of her life, has robbed her of the comfort — of the fanflion of beloved parents. My dear Maria! — what pangs have I not endured since I writ to thee last!
The cruel Marquis would not let me stay at Clarence till the funeral obsequies were performed. He came down to chide me for ha ving, as he called it, Io ftlly an intention) and desired me to go with him back to Paris.
You have always told me, my Maria, that we could oftener command our feelings, than we were willing to endeavour for. in the bitterness of that moment I thought of you. — Overwhelmed as I was with Sorrow at the idea of parting for ever from the objects in the world, I held most dear, though cold and inanimate — to go with a man whom I neither loved or respe(sted — a maji from whom I could expert no consolation for^the heartbreaking

At these words I hid my face ip the bosom of Madanie De Sanfeerre — and in Spite of my resolution, I burst into an agony qf tears.
The coach was at the dqor in a rpoment. — I arose — I was hastening to take one fare, well embrace of my dear father and mother— — breath out one ardent prayer for their repose, at the feet of their coffins; when the inhuman man laid hold of my arm, and exclaimed, dp you intend, Madam, to accompany me or not ?”
1 assured him I would attend him after having taken an eterjiasadieu of my beloved oarents.

By the great God, ” cried he, almost hoarse with pastion, you shall not stir ~ the carriage is ready — step into it, or I shall go without you —
• and if So — never will I behold you more.”
“My Lord, ” replied I, “when I tell you that to take a last view of my tender mother — of my dear father — will be to me in Some measure a ■eonsolation — Surely your goodness will Suffer me to indulge myself in it! — your humanity cannot refuse me Such a trifling comfort !”
“No, ” returned he, — “you shall not overcome me thus by argument — the case is clearly ■ this — 'if you choose to oblige me— — me your
hand directly to convey you to the carriage — if not — remain here for ever.”
The Marquis turned from me in a frenzy —
I paused — 'the affair, however, required no consideration — it was evident that to Support the character of a good wife — to fulfil the vow of obedience I made at the altar — my will must ever be Subiervient to his caprices: — I therefore, with a Sigh, entreated him to be calm, assured him of iny being ready to go with him when ever he thought fit, and stepping to the door, ordered my woman to prepare to attend us immediately to town : this done, I went into the great hall, where the Marquis and Sancerre were afltemblest, and we waited there Some minutes before everything was ready.
1 will not omit to mention to you one circum 'stance that affected me much; it was an odd one — the remembrance of it makes me weep.
As we were detained there for Nannette and the little parcel with my night clothes, which sbe had orders to bring with her, my father’s old favourite Spaniel crawled towards me, and laying himself at my feet, gave a deep groan. — I stooped down to caress him — 1 called him by his name
— he heard me not — that groan was his last.

“Poor Zephyr 1” cried the old butler, with tears .falling from his eyes, “you and L have looked on happy days — they are all passed now— — you have died in good time 1. 1 could have given way to Some bursts of grief
. — but I thought of your remark — and Suppreifing my ienssbility, I hurried into the coach — where, under the darkness of the night, I Succeeded in concealing the real poignancy of my Sorrow.
Tell me, my Maria, if you do not think I have had Some trials to contend with?
After travelling about twenty miles, I found myself incapable of proceeding further — an universal faintness overspread my frame; I Sunk upon the shoulder of my friend Banfcerre. — the Marquis, I believe, was terrified; he ordered his servants to stop at the next village, where I lay the remainder of the night in an uneasy bed, and a room So Small and cold, as to afford me but very little rest. I was awakened early in the morning to proceed on my journey, which I undertook with no pleasure— — with a visibly increasing indisposition. When we arrived at Paris, I was taken extremely ill — and I am at present So'weak and languid from all I have endured, as to be Scarcely able to hold rny pen.
Madame De Srnfcerre has never left me. The Comte De Solignac has often called to make the most friendly inquiries after my health. I have Sent to beg his company in my dressing room this evening. — I will own to you, I dtfire to Speak to him on a subject which I once firmly intended never to mention to him more; but my dear mother,
^ •/
in her dying moments. presented me with the portrait of the Comte De Luzy — I wish not to keep it — my mother k, nev not how dar h; s image was ‘still to my bosom — she offered it to me as a remembrancer of an inestimable friend, whom she
had

had ever prized as Such — and to whom I owed some esteem. I have, however, consulted my 'religion — my reason upon it; they both condemn my keeping in posteltion the pi6iure of a man, who must ever appear to me .in the light of a dangerous insinuating lover. — My heart rebels against the Severity of this determination — but my poor heart must conquer all its weaknesses — or break in the attempt. I listen not to it~ 1 pay no regard to its Soft complainings — I consider it as a treacherous friend — as a dangerous pleader — the image of Luzy is Sufficiently impressed upon it — it need not desire more. Ah, it is not an inanimate portrait that is there painted? — he breathes — he lives — he Speaks himself I
I have Seen Solignac — he received from me the picture with sighs and reluclance. He bade me keep it — for he believed it was all that remained ol his friend, — 1 started — he Seemed Sorry for what had escaped him — he took it however — ■ but would explain himself no farther. What could he mean, ray Maria? — perhaps it was an artifice to induce me not to part with the charming portrait I
The Marquis has entirely forsaken Madame La Bert; who has, it Seems, Suffered So cruelly by his negledf, that forgetting all her other Suitors, she has retired to a convent wlrere she proposes to end her days in Sorrow and repentance. Poor Madame La Bert! I will not at present intrude on her retirement, lest she should impute it to a far different cause from that which must inspire me to visit her. Son weeks hence I will go to her convent — I will encourage her repentance — I will weep over her misfortune, and endeavour to console her for it.

Victoria to Maria.
I TOLD you in my last pf my intention to visit Madame La Bert; I went tp her convent yes terday, and will give you/the particulars of our conversation.
I
I would nol tell my name, but desifed one of the Sisters to say, “a fiiend of hers would be glad to Speak with her.” 1 did not wait long — Madame La Bert appeared — sbe is, at present, only a pensioner in the house — I therefore Saw her without restraint. As fpon as sbe entered, I could perceive that the Sight of me affected her highly — sbe blusbed — >sbe trembled— — hesrtated. I appeared not to observe her cpnfuston r but ad^ vanced towards her, and Saluted her with much freedom and friendship. The poor woman reco ^ vered hersflf, in Some degree, from the unaffecl: : ed ease of my deportment: she wiped the tears ftoyn her eyes — and paid me in return Some polite and agreeablp compliments. She condoled : with me ypon the fable shefs I wore, and heaved many Sighs on Seeing me aste^ied the occasion of rny assuming it.
“Ah, Madam, ” sbe at length exclaimed, happy had it been for me had my parents lived to inspe^ and watch oyer my education! — their child would not now be the prey of cruel re rrprce^the only objet in the world, who could. injure amiableness like yours! — That I have injured you — is too true — that I do repent Sincerely of it — is also a truth. I do not merit the honour of a visit from you. You may be a stranger to

my guilt — but I can never consent to abuse you further by Suffering you to remain in an error So fatal to my peace — So prejudicial to your honour. You must not repeat this favour. Madam continued she in a flood of tears, “my character is no longer an innocent one — the world will talk, should you renew your intimacy with me — and the chastity of your fame would be blackened by your friendship for me.” Ah my God !” continued Madame La Bert, ** what pu nishment do I not deserve I — yet I will not merit more, by pretending innocence, and Suffering you most beautiful, most excellent lady, to continue your esteem for me. — Enter not these walls again, until I prove myself a penitent magdalen indeed — until I can invite you to behold me about to re stgn the world, and all its allurements — until, worn by fasting, prayer, and hardship, I shall in Some measure have expiated the enormity of ihofe crimes for which I deserve to Suffer.”
At thfife ’ Dfds, Madame La Bert covered her face with Iier nand, and the tears trickled in large drops through her fair and stender fingers. As for my part I wept with her — I endeavoured to com* sort her — I bade her not to despond; to confidep that God "Was very merciful, and never rejesfed the sigh of a nenitent — the tears of a contrite heart. I bewailse w ith her the unhappy credulity o f our sek — I inveighed against the too cruel arts !js the other, which were ever practised with impunity agair^ our weakness. I assured her she should always V mand ."•y friendship ^that I never offered it to .^cisbefore — becauit she stood in no need of consolation till now — but as it was now re<^irired — I hoped I was incapable of withholding it fi-om her.
Madame La Bert viewed me with eyes of astonishment — she could not express her feelinga^she

Seized hiy hand — she carried it with wildness there lips.
“Ah, ” she exclaimed, the cruel — the barbarous Marquis! — he has robbed me not only of virtue — but of peace for ever 1”
“My dear madam, ” cried I, “are these not synonymous terms? be persuaded there is but one way of regaining the latter — and that can only be by living up to those Sentiments of piety and religion, which heavfen has now been pleased to inspire your heart with.” ’
I will not repeat the effusions of her gratitude, in return for a mere nothing, a mere charitable visit, which gave me more pleasure than it could have conferred on her,, since it afforded me an opportunity of beholding the most edifying example in the world and of being convinced that the heart of this unfortunate woman was Sincerely touched with a just sense of her dangerous way of life. People, 1 believe, thought her mors abandoned than she really was, she had great vi vacityi — was a free talker — and had a degree of coquetry in her disposttion which rendered her the ' objeist of every man’s attention. She is very pretty too; — a circumstance I never before ob’' Served until I beheld her in the amiable light she appeared yesterday. I will own to you her former carriage was too affiired too indelicate to allow me to see her with unprejudiced eyes — she was, however,, always talked: of as a great jbeau ty.
You will perhaps fuppose that the Marquis having got rid of this engagement is more at home; and is become domestic: — but there yoiii will Sidly mistake : he now pays his devoirs to the celebrated Le Blanc, who is the handsomest — the most extravagant — and the most elegant court fan in all Paris.
/ Yesterday
O F THE ROC K. ^
Yesterday as I was returning from the convent which immures the unhappy La Bert, my carriage wasdriven violently against by another — and in Such a manner as to prevent either from proceeding. I was terrified, and looked out — when I perceived the Marquis and this unfortunate creature in the chariot, which impeded my way : at that moment I heard a general cry in the strefet, that it was the marchiotieis Ds laud.anne^ who was in the moji imminent danger; and the Duke De Henrie, with many other young noblemen, who were standing at the door of an hotel which I pasted, ran round and persuaded me to alight until the carriages stiould be disengaged.. immediately gave my hand to the Duke, and was by him conducted into the house of a bourgeoise, where the gentlemen clustered about me, to veil ' from my sight the disagreeable view of my hus band leading forth Mademoiselle. I confess it gave me Some pleasure to observe, upon reentering my carriage, hers lying entirely neglected by every one but her own attendants; whilst all seemed anxiousty to place mine in its former Security. A wheel which had been torn off from hers; still lay upon the ground — mine, that had Suffered in the same manner, was entirely Set to
rights, and that almost instantaneousty.
I astedted not to know whole chariot it was, nor who were in it; 1 therefore begged the Duke, if he was acquainted with the persons to whom th e carelestnels of my coachman had caused Such an injury, to asture them I was sorry for it, ard hoped they would accept of my compliments. He smiled, and bowing upon my hand, entreatedme to
believet he would abl on the occafton like one who conftdered my politeness as his own. — I ordered my people to distribute money amongst the oblio ino crowd, and returned home through loud acclalna

tions of applause. The worst — on, if you will, the best of it was, that I saw Mademoiselle Lt Blanc in a house just opposite to where my carriage stood when I entered it — So that she and her suivante had the mortification to behold me an ob ■je£l of concern to the multitude, whilst they both experienced their contempt and negle6i: .- — So certain it is, that the appearance of a woman of virtue, will always command respebl and astistance in distress, before one famous for nothing but beauty and profligacy, even from those who are libertines in their general condikst. I met the Marquis at night at a Supper given by the Comteffe De grignon— — could hardly restrain the impetuosity of his fury at my approach!! it in his eyes; and left Madame De grignon’s as soon as I could retire with any tolerable decency. He is, however, determined to mortify me for the accident, though I am Sure nobody could be more blameless on the occasion. He told me this morning that he intends to sell his seat at Clarence which my father left him. I answered that I had no right to say a word against it, if it was his will to do so. However, I think it is tod charming a place for him to give up easily, and I make no doubt he will be proud to keep it, in Spite of this vain boast. Poor man! he has more of my pity than aversion.
I have not Seen the Duke De Maurice Since my return to town. — He has lately lost his mother, which it is believed sincerely grieves him. I am ferry for the citcumstance, but happy that his absence from Paris frees me from the trouble of listening to a fubjefit in which he appears so obstinately interested. He is thought to be a dangerous man— — how can a heart like mine be sensible of
\
those charms, which is steeled by duty, and has already loved one so much superior to him in all that can engage the tenderness of woman?

TFIE Duke De Maurice is returned to Paris,
arid the strong marks of grief which were Said to be expressed on his countenance, and in his behaviour, have Sled like clouds before the appearanceiof the fun.
He is gay, assured, and gallant — he Speaks of love, like one'certain of success— — paints tome his passion in every look and word to be short., he is troublesorne and highly disagreeable.
d was yesterday in waiting on Madame D’ as at court, when the Comte D’ ks and the Duke .De Maurice made their appearance. I was in conversation with some of the ladies. — The Comte and the Duke, who had shown themselves in the circle, retired from it and joined us.
You
\

“You are too charming this morning, Madame De Lausanne!” cried the Comte with a / polite air, and a tender look; ** you outsbine in beauty, ” added he in a whisper“ “other woman, the Queen not excepted.” — Icurlfied. — -** By my faith, ” continued he, Madame D’ as does not ai prudently in keeping So near her person the loveliest woman in France : (he must be vain to fuppose, that she will claim adoration on those days that you afe in waiting.”
The Comte played with my fan — and in taking iit from my hand, he contrived to press my fingers.
. — I Said little — I received his flattery with a polite indifference — he perceived it — and leaning on the duke’s arm. Said in a voice just loud enough for me to hear, this Madame De lausanne is, I find, one of those cruel beauties who can behold the agonies they cause, without feeling even cem paflion. — There is a Something in her eyes, which awes me into Silence. — Tell her, however, my dear Maurice, that a Prince loves her, who will only value that title, as he can confer glory and power on her.
The Comte, after this Speech, retired to Some distance, and the Duke approached me. He Smiled in my face.
“Madam, you have heard the commiffioni am charged with from the Comte ?”
Yes, my Lord, ” cried I, I have. The Comte is excusable in giving you Such a one, to a woman of whole principles hd knows nothing : — you, however, have not the like apology in the acceptance of it to make; — but if you areto learii it now, be assured yourself, and tell your prince, that I am not the creature you and he take me for: that I owe too much love and duty to my husband ever to receive with pleasure such declarations
from

from any other man.” I Said this with an air of anger and reserve, and walking frcm him placed myself too near Madame D’ to lustre .Such.
impertinence again during my stay in the drawing-room.
The Comte D’ as is very handsome — is very witty — and could my heart be endangered by the conversation of any other man but Luzy, the Comte D’ as would be the most likely person to Set me on my euard — but he is as much inferior to Luzy, as he is Superior to every other. — Do you not desphe ihe Duke De Maurice?
The Marquis, I perceive, is ruining himself ■with play, and his extravagant generosiiy to ma •demoiselle Le Blanc. — It is at her house he games
W
So highly — and if 1 am not misinformed he is always a considerable loler. His estate of Belfont has been Sold to defray a debt of honour to the Chevalier D’eibeu, who is a" man notorious for hying by the ruin of others. The Marquis looked a little Serious upon it for an hour or two — but a note from his Sultana Soon dispellcd every cloud, and he hastendd to receive conselation from her — or rather— — be induced to Sell a few more of his estates, in order that sbe and her followers should gain by his folly. She has., I am told, a new e quipage for almost every day in the year — that her deaths are sumptuous, and that her jywels are as fine as mine. She lives in a style hardly to be equalled — and her house is the resort of all the' libertine youth of fashion. The Marquis De Lau sanne is, however, above suspicion — he cannot suppose it possible, that a woman whom he has .once addressed, should ever prove herself unwiprthy ■of that honour — It never enters the poor marquis’’s head., that, amongst the profusion of his gifts, there .may be a certain void in the heart of a courtesan which he never, with all his merit, canfup

- ply. He does not dream that this void must be stlled by variety — by the most assiduous and stavisti attention — by new conquests— — in fine, by the indulgence of every caprice. Had the Marquis icss money — was he not reputed and known to he one of the richest noblemen in France — mademoi felle Le Blanc would Since have deserted him for a Superior fortune; but as that is not easy to be found, ssie contents herself with paying homage to him, until the poor man shall have paid too dear a debt to her charms and avarice — until he really ruins himself for eve r in. fortune and in health.
I often visit Madame La Bert, who really appears a Sincere penitent. She wept the other, day in Speaking of the Marquis, and Swelled with indignation when She informed me, that he had quitted her for mademoiselle Le Blanc. I will own to you I wondered how sbe could mention him — and still more how her delicacy could start Such a subject to me, — her anger to, when sbe mentioned maderroistlle Le Blanc I — but, thank heaven, I was not cenlorious in my conjedlures! and had reason Soon after to believe bv her behaviour that that resentment was only the last struggle of an •expiring flame which sbe was gaining virtue fustif i
cient.to abhor. j
Madame De Sanfcerrc is really a true and as feftionate friend — sbe Seldom leaves me but oi occaficns which demand her presence at home — i sbe rallies the Marquis charrningly — and very often makes him look Sillier thf(n .is absolutely natural to himhe, however, takes her pleasantry with good humour, though he dares not return it. She afkedhim, the other day,, in her lively manner, whether he did not think his wife the moil beautiiul woman in the universe he Smiled —
ran and took my hand, and led me to him. ** Here

b a shape 1 — an air! — a face! — a hand and arm!. — heaven and earth, man!' — do but view her with attention.”
The Marquis, who was sitting down, looked up at me, and Smiled again.
. ‘‘ Come, come, ” cried she with impatience,
answerme!
The Marquis pulled me on his knee.
“, Why, Madam, ” replied he, you shall have my opinion. — My wife is certainly the most perfect both in form and face of any woman I ever Saw; — but I cannot be contented with that alone. — She is witty too, I believe — very well. — This I take upon trust — fori never Saw her cheerful. — She is warm, fensible and loving — at least 1 have heard that she once loved with ardour. — All that is very well too. — Her husband never experiences from her these proofs of sensibility. — 'Isbus, Madam, ” added he, I may be Said to have the most charming woman in the world in my poffes fion — when in truth — I find her only a very beautiful st.itue. — Such a behaviour I cannot brook in short if she loved me — she would ast differently — and perhaps if I was not her husband— — should like her better.”;
This, my dear Maria, was a very heavy charge against me — notwithstanding [defended myself very tolerably. — I protested that he could be no judge of my affection for him, for that he never gave me the pleasure of his company at home, but in a large circle. — I turned his weapons at last So elfec tually upon himself, that be was brought to acknowledge he might have made a better kushand. — In fine, I invited him to Sup with me the next night, and promised him amusement. — We parted very good friends that evening; but I perceived he attended his usual appointment with Le Blane after all this conversation.

The next nisrht came — .1 dressed with an easr elegance which really became my features, anil wliichl had Succeeded in that day better than ever: hyy’’company was formed of the most agreeable women of fashion, and ol men not inferior to them hn wit and brilliancy. Alter the disbes were removed, an extieme ssne band of mussc which I had ordered to be prepared in the next room struck up, and after they had played Some time, every lady gave an Italian air accompanied.by a.piano forte.^and a German flute— — a, French one — ■ then an. Engiissi one, out of the opera of artax erxes. Their voices were all fine — their accoin panyments admirable— — — mirth — and the moll; delicate pleasure Secerned too possess every heart, shut that of the Marquis, who endeavoured, 'through politeness, to.conceal his restlesshess — but .1 could plainly perceive that his Situation was un easy to him, and that decency prevented his leaving, it. I do asture you, my 'dear Maria, I studied to sj’ive him delight — to charm — toinspire him with, love: I even forgot Luzy for the night— — at least, I strove to banish his idea from my bosom. ‘__I considered, that if, ' through any coidnefs or neglect in my behaviour towards him, my husband gave himself up to libertinism — I must ^and condemned before the tribunal of God and man. The thought shocked me — and I called forth all’my graces — made use of every insinuation, every becom ^ jng artifice to make him suppose iiimself beloved, and to draw him most powerfully to me alone. I, consented to fing at his request — I exerted my voice, and filled the room with thcrfostest sounds I .was mistress of. Solignac took up the flute — he accompanied me in a touching and masterly manlier. I Sang of love — !.I expressed it not only by my lips — I fixed my eyes on laiisanne — I made them fpotik; mere tenderly. The Marquis was struck —

We are to have an elegant ball in Paris this evening, given by the officerc of the be****k’s regiment — the Duke De F, ***’^* always elegant,. will, I suppose, outshine himself on this occasion. -- Fle is very handsome— — as witty as he is charming. Madame De sanscerre says he shall .be her cecisheo for the evening — he is a gallant man — well received by the ladies, and is h general favourite amongst them.

I REJOICE to hear that Madame De Villeneauf is able to be removed to Belvoir — her estate of that name is a little paradise — and the air will, I trust, prove Salutary to her. You Say she mentions me with affection, and desires me to hope for a better change when it shall please heaven to appoint. ell my dear and revered monitress that I endeavour to astume courage, and to gain by dishpation a thoughtlessness of mind which alone can preserve me from despair. — Remembrance will, however, obtrude its busy self even in those hours of noise and folly, and embitter every Scene. ' Tell her, however, I arn not wanting in my efforts to conquer it — religion i'nstrufts me to do so — how 1 Succeed, heaven, who witnesses my bitter tears, can tell. — 1 will turn to another fubjest, my dear Maria. — I left you in my last to prepare for a ball.
I called upon Madame De Sanfeerre at the appointed hour, and we went thither together. The Comte d’a****’s carriage had just driven off before mine drew up — he did us the honour of staying to hand us from it — he whispered as he led me in — that he intended to attach himself to me for that night. ** I shall, continued he, beat your elbow constantly. — Do you dance?” — I told him no — he entreated — I pleaded indifposition — he declared then, that he would not be prevailed on either, to partake of that amusement and he kept his word.

fed — and with many of the other officers condudl ed us to Seats. The assembly was very brilliant —
, but was too public — the Duke De Maurice was there masked— — followed me about all night as a Spy — he listened to everything the Comte D
Said to me — and in fatl he heard Several tender things on his part. I behaved with my iisual reserve, and with as much indifference as I really fek. He had taken my fan from my hand — but by Some accident it fell from his, and the outward stick was a little damaged. — He put it in his bosom, and vowed I should never have it more.
I was takinsj Some refreshments which Jhe Duke De SHAD presented me with, — I pulled off my glove, and believe me, it was stolen immediately by I know not whom. My Spy (the mask) .was very near me at that time — So were the Comte D’ A****sy the Duke De FAND the Chevalier De Mondonoir.. — The theft was amongst them.
» — they all denied it — but I perceived a Smile front E the Comte D’ a****s’s countenance which made

me fufpe£l him. — In short, during ray stay at the ball, he was never one moment from my fide — If and my stay was longer than I had intended it * should be. There were a number of masses there — amongst the rest was one who entertained the company highly. — Some fuspeeted it to be the Marquis De Palmene — others monsieur De Louvoi — but 1 perceived — or at least thought I perceived too much of a female voice to believe it to be either. I remarked' it to the Comte D’ as— — was struck with the conceit, for the mask wore the habit of a friar — and was really witty, Satirical and polite. The imarquis De lausanne came in with a lady masked— — wore none himself, but appeared in the most becoming dress and style I had ever observed him to assume. The friar on Seeing him and his lady — approached them with a grave and priestly air.

Child, ” Said he to mademoiselle Le Blanc, I am concerned to See 'thee So free with the Marquis De lausanne for turn reasons.”
“v.'hat are they father?” cried Le Blanc. First, ” replied the friar, because to be arm in arm with him implies a Scandal to your character — for no. woman of virtue was ever Seen lo lmi liar with him' — not even his wife.”
Here I blushed — the Comte D’ as prested my hand.
“Secondly, because if you really are not lost to Sentiment — and should happen to entertain an unfeigned tenderness for him — he will Soon give you reason to repent your fondness by dismisting you with ignominy — and forgetting your ever having conferred a favour on him. ~ Such is the cha rattcr of him, whom you Seem to regard as your lever.”
The Marquis looked offended. And who are you, ” exclaimed he in a rage, ‘‘ that dares vnder the veil of.” --

pose this lady to be your wife — and that poor northeast gledied creature who beholds you with anxiety and tenderness — whom every one talks So highly ol — whom 1 have never Seen with you, is a misrress/^ Here the room resounded with applause— — as I pitied the Marquis — and really felt a good deal for my own Situation — I gave my hand to Solignac, who conveyed me to my carriage unperceived by the rest, who were So much engrosted by the friar as not to be scnsible for Some moments of my departure. Madame De sanseerre,. however, who staid until the dawn of day, listening to the gallant compliments of her handsome partner, concluded for me the conversation of the friar. The Marquis whispered him, that he ex
pedied to see him the next day in another habit' — a habit which would entitle him to treat him as he deserved
** fanciified dress, Sir, ” continued he, though but assumed in jest — has Something in • ifwhich checks my rage. i to morrow 1 willalk for vengeance.”

The Marquis turned from him in indignation — and the Comte D’ tollovved the priest,
• D 5 * ‘ Y ou

** You arc but a young piece of divinity I be lieve, ” said the Comte to him, as he got him into a corner of the room, deserted by all but Madame De sanscerre and Solignac; “you are, however, father, the most agreeable qf your ori ders ever conversed with.”;
Ah, fon, ” replied the friar, “People see at court very differently from those in the world : r were you to behold me in my convent, you would turn off — and leave my Sober lessons fora less fashionable hearer — but at a masquerade I find a friar can be more attended to, than a blooming girl of Patmos — and that by a prince, who is well known to be a man of gallantry.”
Here the Comte laughed out.
“Father, Said he, “suffer me to crave your blessing, and prayers for the reformation of Versailles — but first allow me to kifs that holy hand.’* The wary priest would not content to this Salutation, which was only meant to try by the soft nefs and delicate form of the hand, whether it was a man or a woman who personated the cha radfer. The refusal, however, convinced the Comte of its being a female, and he told her in a low voice of his conje^ure — and if she did not show him her face in private there — he would take an opportunity of making her unmask Somewhere else. This teemed to alarm the fidfitious friar, who disappeared very toon after in Spite of the Comte D’ a****’s vigilance. — So much for the ccclefiastic — whom everybody Speaks of — but no one is certain who, or what he is.
The next rr.orning I received, from the Comte jyj fs a very polite billet, to inquire after ny health, and at the Same time the most beautiful fan 1 ever Saw, which he begged my acceptance of in exchange for the one he had taken from
me the night before. There is a motto of diamond?

The Marquis De Lausanne looked displeased as I sbewed him the fan and the billet; he asked me

what they were to him? and throwing them on ray toilette, he quitted the room. Poor man! — •
I could not help the friar’s Speaking plain truth 1 It is now, my dear Maria, Six months since the Comte De Yjxx'zy embarked for Martinico — and no tidings have reached Solignac of his arrival. — I do not Suffer myself to think the worst — oh, no! —

The Marquis De Lausanne, to Monfteur
De Montville.
I HAVE lost a considerable Sum once more, dear Montville, to the Chevalier D’ Elbeu. All my ready money is exhausted, and my estate at Belfont has been Sold to pay a former honourable demand. — Poor Le Blanc is inconsolable — for the ipltes have happened at her house. I will hot leave her, lest she should fuspedl my being obliged to part with another estate, which would stiock her tenderness. I therefore offer you the seat of Clarence, which you wish to ooffess, on those terms I formerly mentioned to you, and to which you agreed. It will affe6t Madame De Lausanne, perhaps, to part with a place to which she has been attached from her infancy — but I cannot think df Selling either of the estates which my fatherless me — until I cannot help myself— — — are valuable to me, more from their being admired by my charming mistress, than for any other reason— — I cannot think of distressing her to indulge a caprice of my wife’s. Adieu, dear Montville — I am at prefect a little low Spirited — abetter run of luck tonight will, however, Set all to rights again — and one look — one Smile from Le, Blanc will make me forget every disagreeable sensation— —
write from her chateau ten miles from Paris. — If
/
you wish to Speak to me on the subject of Clarence, my carriage shall attend you hither — for I cannot think of going to towm for Some days at least.

TH E film that you want, you fray command
of me, dear Marquis, • without giving up the. noble seat of Clarencd. Had I known that Madame De lausanne was tenderly attached to it, I sboiild never have Spoken to you on the sub je6t of selling it. Do me the favour to make me your banker on this occasion — you have unlimited credit'. -

You cannot doubt my friendship for you — Suffer me therefore, dear lausanne, to caution you against the arts of Le Blanc. She knows perhaps that D’ Elbeu will allways win — and that your generous temper will never fuspe.£s how he should do So — I however, who am not blinded by infatuation, can easily See into her Sorrow — and can doubt the chevalier’s honour. Madame De lausanne— — my God, Marquis, what a woman, to be exposed to a pang when a little prudence and an exertion of common fense on your part, could Save her from ever feeling one! ^

My dear friend, I am very miserable— —
amiable Maria, who can console me! — the Marquis is, I fear, almost ruined — his estate of clar.encd is sold — Monsteur De Montville I heard was to be the purchaser— — he has, I am told, declined it, and the Marquis offered it in my presence to the Comte De Sablau — Solignac, who was by, hardly gave the Comte time to answer, before he declared himself ready to pay down the money for it. lausanne closed with the proposal' ' Solignac this day completed the purchase.
It is Some comfort to me that my friend Solignac is in poffestion of it — Since Clarence is no longer mine — 1 am glad it is his. — What a folly, ray Maria! — but alas! I grieve in spite of my reason— — • Luzy I — every grove — every tree — every flowering shrub there, was endeard to me, by your having wandered through all their Sweets — they all can vvitnefs to thy vows of love and fidelity. — It was the place too of my birth — of the birth of my dear father — the favourite residence of my tender mother — rthe place which was consecrated to friendship by my Maria and her Victoria. — Do you remember the little rustic temple at the bottom of the avenue of poplars? — and that alfoem bofomed in the orange grove? • — how often have we listened in them to the warblings of the thrush — the complaints of the nightingale — and to the still Sweeter voices of Lindor and Luzy! — alas, poor Clarence! — ** cruel remembrance — how shall I appease thee I— — cannot write — I am unfit for anything. — The Marquis too looks ill — he frets
— ah,
88
— ah, why does he not aft consistently with reason!! — has quarrelled it Seems with his friend monsieur de Mohtville — that grieves him, I believe. — Madame De sanscerre Says, Dc Montville complained to her of his negieft — he talks with affection of him — and affures her the man is in himself naturally good — but Spoiled by the imprudence of his late parents indulgence — and by Some fatal prejudices which he has imbibed. I honour this Monsieur Dc Montville — his character is unexceptionably good — lam sorry any difference has happened between them, for I was Somewhat easy as song aslausanne consulted his friendship. — The poor Marquis! — although he treats me unkindly, I am sorry for him.
'Madame De sanscerre has just been wdth me — she intreats me to go with her to a masked ball, which is to be given this night iiisparis. She remarks that it will appear to lausanne as if I was not displeased or concerned at his disposal of Clarence — she reasons me into the propriety of being Seen there by him. She says Such constant resignation to his will, must at length open his eyes, and incline him to adopt a different mode of behaviour. — I comply wither heavy heart. Ah, how dreadful is it to astume an appearance So foreign to the real feelings of it !I will not Seal
O C
this until my return — but will endeavour to afnuseyou by a relation of what pastes there.
Madame De sanscerrre chose the habit of a
t
Paifanne — I assumed the neat and Simple one of a shepherdess — I preferred it ior two reasons — the first was, becaiise of its being a character that did not require much wit or vivacity — the Second for its being eafiiy put on without an exertion of taste, magnificence, or study. Solignac, who engaged Madame De sanlcerre’s hand for the night, equipped himself as a gardener — and carried
O F T H E   89
ried with him his implements, and a baiket of natural and artiscial flowers. ’ Our party was large, and we went in about eight o’clock. I was accosted on my entrance by a malk who wore a plain white domino — he told me my name, and in a voice 1 hardly knew. — I pasted by him without returning him an answer. — As Soon as I wasiseat ' ed a devil approached and took me by the hand.
Come, fair Arcadian, ” Said he, “you and.
I must dance a minuet.”
“Excuse me, ” cried I, ** I have been warned against temptatioh.c land your very appearance forbids me to go with yoa.”
^ “Ah!” replied he, ** I am become harmless
'— I forsook the lower regions tonight in order to steal a glance at innocence — and behold — I am fallen in love with it; ”
Saying this, he again tendered me his hand, which I accepted, after whispering him ** that to the Comte D’ as I would e’en venture to en
f \ *
tfust myfest.” He answered only by a pressure of my fingers. We began — neyer did I see Such grace but in the form or Luzy. — ‘‘ Ah! thought L y — I am not mistaken— — is indeed the Comte D’ as. After we had finished, the applaufes of the afltembly Niade me blush though I was under a mask— — the graceful devh kileeled and kissed my hand in presence of them all.
Where did you steal those charming steps — * that air of elegance, pretty maid ?” cried an old fat monk as I passed
** from your convent father, ” replied the devil.,.
No — nor from hell, neither, returned the offended priest,
“From heaven only could they be, ” exclaimed the white domino who had accosted me before;
“from
I
90
“from heaven only, ” and he kissed the hem of my garment.
The pretty air of this gallantry struck me, and taking a flower from my nosegay, and presenting it to him — -! thanked him for his compiiment.~. He pressed the flower to his lips, and hid it in his bosom.
** I am jealous, ” Said the devil to me in alow voice.
Oh fie .” answered I, ** when you left hell, you should have forsworn all unamiablenefs.”
** Ah, “returned he, but at the Same time I should have made a vow not to have fallen in love with every virtue — and alas 1 ssnee I have Seen you, there is no room in my heart for anything else, excepting fear and jealousy, which are the inseparable handmaids of that passion with which you have inspired me.”
I was about to answer when a nun pulled me by the sseeve.
“Rash girl, ” exclaimed she, ** whence comes thy boldness?? — could conceive that, young and innocent as you appear, you should be at tra<sted by vice — and that in its own rude shape! — The devil to conquer generally altumes the form of Maurice. — but Maurice, to captivate., need only, I find, appear as the devil.”
** Ah, gentle Sister !” cried I — and I took her arm, “is this indeed the d uke De Maurice ?”
r
** It is — it is, ” answered she, none but the Duke De Maurice could' so well personate the cha rafiler he has assumed.’^
The devil laughed.
, ** Ha, my pretty vestal!” cried he,. “Seizing her hand, “you Seem to know the Duke De Maurice better than the duties which that habit should Impose on you. — You can tell,. I find, how dangerous. he is — though the virtues of charity and
Silence
 1
Silence shpuld rebel against so public a declaration.’’
“I know no more of thee, ” replied she, than what Some of my frail Sex have told me.” I begin to suspe6t my innocent nun, ” whif |>ered he, “that you know as much as the Duke De Maurice as any frail one of them all. — Come, come, who art thou ?” and he took her familiarly under the arm.
The witty nun threw him off with an air of Satirical coyness, protesting, that so frangea con -- nedtion could never take place as that heivoeen virtue and viccy not evert for a moment. ^ What think you father demanded she of the fat monk who was at that moment by her elbow. ** Why, daughter, ” returned he, ** my opinion is, that the devil who now stands before us — is but a poor harmless one. — I protest to you, I believe there is more danger in his appearance than in himself, for I observe this fair Shepherdess listens to him with attention — a circumstance which could not happen, were he preaching up to her the maxims of iniquity Well Said, father !” cried the devil; now, Sister, what say you to that?”
** Why, ” answered She, that the devil has t length got hold of the priest — and that I must fly for it.” — sbe immediately mixed in the crowd, and put an end to their dialogue.
I began now to perceive that it was to a man I hated above all others, I had hitherto been so polite and obliging — the hint was enough — and I avoided him as much as poslible for the rest of the evening — his art in affecting the Comte D’ as Voice, had entirely misted me — he certainly did it admirably. The white domino, on observing, that I Wished to get rid of the accomplished devil, hinted to him, that he had better endeavour to find out the face of the lively nun, adding,

: “If I mistake not, ” said he, “thou art Madame De lausanne.”
** Ah, ” answered I, “I am Sorry you can' think So — for it is to that fupposition alone I owe all the fine things you have said to me this evening.”
“Why, replied he, it is very true that I. have taken you for the prettiest woman I ever Saw— — I cannot presume to say she is the most beautiful I may yet see — therefore if you are not her — in pity to my wishes, slip aside for one moment your mask— — if your face corresponds with the charms of your person— — at least have it in my power to declare that I have beheld Madame De laufanne’s equal — until then — I must Own that I never have.”
After that, ” cried I, “it is impostible for me to grant your request — am not handsome— — figure is the best of me — my face would destroy the favourable imprestion it has made on you, were I to indulge your curiosity. But pray, who are you? I never before heard your voice — and will acknowdedge I can form of your face no idea. — You are not the Chevalier De mondo ndir ?”
Do you wish me to say yes?” demanded he, ** I do not care about it, ” returned I.
Weil then, ” resumed the malk, ** I give you my honour I am not even acquainted, so as to converse with the Chevalier. — I am a stranger to you I believe — however, if you wish to see my \ face I v/lll indulge you — could I but obtain such a promise from you.”

■ '' Since you are So polite, you shall have it, ’^ replied I, “come with me to that Side board yonder, and I will Slip asvde my maik in order to take Some orgeat.”
As I Spoke this, I took Madame De sanscerre by the arm, and as we approached the table, told her of my intention to show myseif — and my curiostty to know who he was. She was anxious as to that particular herself — for she had heard many wonder who it could be. The mask leem ^ed transported at my condescension, 'and hurried ius throusch the .crowd in order to ariive at the

wished for corner. When we got there, he filled two glasses of orgeat for .Madame De sanscerre and myself. We took out our handkenchei.fs to to apply them to por faces, instead of the masses, which for the conveniency of drinking v/e were about to remove; before.i untied mine I asked if il might depend upon his latisfying my curiosity after I had gratified his:?
“To doubt iti” replied the Domino, were to fuspedt my honour! — but to convince you that my intention is not to deceive, I will show myself sbefore i can even have an opportunity to repent of doing So — for to confess the truth, did I not think ■you were/feally the marchioness.de lausanne, I tshould nor, 1 believe, have made you Such a promise, ’^
So saying he took off with inimitable grace the
■ vizor that had'concealed his fine countenance — < ^and who do you imagine stood before me, no
other than the Comte D’ Artois himself. — ij was now exceedingly embarrassed— — was almost ashamed, after the fine things I had heard him say of me, to part with my mask— — it would have been acting ungenerousty to have done otherwise: : idea determined me. — I took the orgeat ■with a treihbling hand — r and 'with the other I withdrew

drew the piece of Silk which covered my face. He Seized my hand and pressing it to his bosohi exclaimed, “charming creature! was it poltible to have mistaken for one moment that ihape' that.air !”
I will now own to you my weakness, my dear Maria, and acknowledge that I was chagrined at finding it to be any other than the Marquis De Palmenc; who has disappeared Since the departure of his friend Luzy. Some Say he is gone to Italy — others declare they have lately met him in Paris, though they did not Speak to him. solig nac, who should best know, ' tells me he is not in France — that his condu6t has of late been mysterious to him — that he ressdes, he believes chiefly in Italy — that he has never learned So however from himself — for in his letters he only says he has abjured France till luzy’s return to it — if that should ever happen, he will see it again with transport — until then, he shall be bound to no place in particular — but will consider himself as a citizen of the world. All this I knew— — I mull confess a delusive hope had charmed my bread — and every word the Comte D’ Artois uttered, I thought rescmbled the marquis’s peculiar elegant method of expression. — The idea of conversing: : one who had Seen Luzy, even on board the vessel which carried him from France — the hope of hearing that his last words were ** Adieu Victoria !” — his last ssghs were Sent forth towards her — yes, my friend, I will own my weakness — and that I merited the •disappointment I had met with.
The Comte D’ Artois had managed the discovery So well, that no body was the wiser but the parties themselvcs respefting anything that had pasted — and we joined our Seat again, without their having the least Suspicion of our real errand to the fide board. The Comte was more than
ever charmed with me — he never quitted me for
tha
 $
the night — he made love to me — but it was not with an air of insolent confidence — the expresti ©ns he chose, were delicate and timid — and what would pass as mere gallantry. — You may be Sure I affected to receive them as such, though in every Syllable that fell from his lips, I could perceive the agitations of a wounded heart.
Our attention was now drawn to a corner of the room, from whence we heard loud peals of laughter, and beheld an immense crowd gathered — we ■drew near to them, and by Singular good fortune got into the very thickest of the throng, where we learned without inquiry the cause of this partial assemblage. The nun was in a close conversation with the devil; the Spirit of which, had attra61; ed •numbers: amongst the rest, a graceful Turk, and an elegant Sultana, came thither to observe what was going on — we had taken our stands just before they appeared; and heard the nun lay, ■ “Well, monsieur le Diable, you have left hell for very little purpose if your intention was to carry me back with you! — What may be my fate Some time hence indeed, I know not — but this \ am certain of — I will mortify more than ever in order to avoid you in the next world.”
“Why, ” cried he, taking her hand, ** you have not hitherto been very deaf to my persuasions— — was by my instigation you put on this weil— — was by my advice you assumed this becoming habit — and it is now by my command that you show the beauties of your face.” — So laying he caught her in his arms, and was 'going to throw back her veil, when the Comte D’ Artois interposed.
Never, by heaven !” exclaimed he.
Avaunt thou evil projedtor! — this lady claims .a superior power, which will proteff her from your insolence.” The Turk, who had heard

with pleasure the devil’s intention to discdver the jiu», stepped forth to answer the Comte.
“And pray, ” Said he haughtily, “why should

She whispered him — he bowed.
“And now, ” exclaimed she, good folks, it is time for me to absent myself from a Scene of dissipation which nothing but the hope of making converts could have allured me to — If I have Succeeded even with one, I shall be recompensed for my pious labour — if I can change one heart, I am Satisfied.” — As this was evidently meant as a flattering compliment to the Sultan, it was received with applause. — “As for this poor devil, ” cried she, “even let him escape to those regions where he learned his first precepts — and where he is only fit to live — let him, however, carry with him this moral truth as a Sentiment which he may give the tonne to amongst his companions; that, to ' a woman of virtue, nothing is more insupporta ble than the perseverance of addrestes which cannot end with honour — and to even a woman of gallantry, mirth is always unpleasing unless checked by decency and humanity. — It is to this gentleman, added she, curtseying gracefully to the Comte D’artois that I am indebted for not being known to the whole assembly — a circumstance that must have pained a female not totally lost to modesty and feeling.” — As she finished, she rushed amongst the crowd — and it was owing to an ace

declaration you made me last night, j Marquis, has given new charms to the world — has added additional horrors to a convent. In burying myself in Solitude I assumed an air of penitence — 1 bewailed to all whose charity brought them to visit me, my former indiscretions — 1 wept over past errors — but owned to no one except your wife, the criminality of ray connexion with you: her piercing e}’es vere not to be deceived — her religion — her piety induced her .from that instant to compastionate and befriend me. It is from her countenance I hope to retrieve my character — It is from her unfufpedling nature I mean to enjoy those pleasures, which the cruel breath of Scandal deprived me of for a while. I have written to her — I have told her of my intention to appear again in the world. I have attributed to the innocent gaiety of my heart, a distike to the unsocial confinement of a convent. I have prayed her to believe me not less sensible of my former unhappe weakness— — determined, with the asiistance of

The castle is large, and its Situation is most romantically beautiful. A pavilion has been erected in the centre of a thick wood, under which we have had the most rural and delightful entertainments. A. rotunda in the manner of English Ranelagh (which Lauianne often talks of with rapture) has been built on a ristng hill at a Small distance from the castle, .at the foot of which is an enamelled plain of a vast extent. This rotunda is elegantly fitted up,, and we have concerts and balls alternately there. Every person Seems happy — every person is really so, but your poor discontented Victoria. She with her friend sanscerre frequently steal a solitary walk, during which I indulge those tears which flow from the very centre of a Sorrowing
heart.
The Comte D’artois has honoured us with his presence — his wit enlivens all — but his particular, gallantries distress me. The Duke De Maurice has not been invited — he was not in Paris when we left it — else the Marquis would certainly have remembered him in the general invitation.

ploring her past faults — declaring a natural antb pathy to a conventual life — and praying my pro te6fion and countenance in her Second appearance in the world? my answer was short .and civil, as furing her I was grieved for her past miscondu£t — and hoping a reformation of her manners — that my friendship could now be no longer Serviceable to her, and that her own prudence would be her best guide and proteduon. — The Marquis is very polite towards me — but that is all. He often goes to Paris, as he Says, on particular business — during which time he leaves Solignac Maitre de Logh, As it is our plan that no ceremony should be used, and that all should pursue their different incliha hons, his going from his guests is not constdered as a breach of politeness., but as an example of the - freedom every other person should ule: besides, he calls himself only a visitor of mine — and affures his company that he vas invited by me with the rest of the gentlemen whom 1 favoured vvith a Summons, to be of this rural party. Unfortunate man! — he will, no doubt, see hisabsur*
dities when it is too late to amend them — he will

repent of his credulity when he can believe no longer- -- weep over his errors, and pray for his converston.
Madame De sanscerre and Solignac are happy lovers. Her former husband’s ill treatment has not disgusted her from wearing the matrimonial chain. They are both lively — they are both handsome— — they are at once the delight and envy of the world. They dance, they fing together — a stmilarity of difposition renders them always agreeable to each other — and the small share of coquetry that runs through her composition, keeps at the same time his fears and love alive. I vvould say they were formed for each other, had 1 not often pronounced the same of a

miserable pair, who seemed to be as near happiness' — luit cruel fate divided them for ever. Ah, my Maria; when in the woods of Clarence, I listened to those pure and deligiusul sentiments, which flowed from the lips of Luz, y — when my own bosom felt and approved all that they uttered — when a fmilinof father and an indularent rno
o o
then looked with complacency on our mutual passion— — L not then say Luzy was born for his Victoria alone I — Ah did not my hard destiny Soon t ear me from his arms — and condemn me to lau fanne’s! — Remembrance, remembrance — thou arc too painful 1
I was weeping over a string.of pearl which lu zy had presented me with in happier days — i had recalled the graces to my imagination which played around his.person, when he with a gallant and tender air, tied it on my arm— — pi^ured to myself his Smile — I beheld him drop on one knee before me — I there heard him pour forth a renenew al of the fondest — the most faithful vows — my heart caught the flame which fancy had kindled — and forgetful of my husband, 1 dared to press the fenfeless beads to my lips. I was in a fummer house alone, and did not fuppose any mortal was witness to my tears and weakness. “Ah !” exclaimed I, “where art thou my best beloved? — where dost thou wander a prey to anxiety and despair?? — unfortunate Victoria — her fate has involved thee in wretchedness. ”
Here I paused to raise again the bracelet to my lips — but reflecting on the cruel ceremony which had bound me to the Marquis — I flung it from me, and it fell before me on the ground.
What am I about ?” cried I almost dispos feflted of reason“ “Lausanne— — virtue — pardon me P'

At that moment I heard a rustling, and quicker than thought the Comte D’ Artois stood in my prelence~~i was stocked — I was confused — I was frightened almost to fainting. He beheld my a gctnies and fell at my feet.
Lovely Madame De lausanne, ’^ cried he in a tremulous tone, fear nothing — It is true I am not your confident — yet I profess myself your friend. It is true I am not a favoured lover — but if he that is So happy as to postefs your heart, is now a wanderer in France — my protedfion stall Save him from deserving that appelation in future — 1 will have him placed about my person in fa vour and magnificence. Tell me his name, I ber

feech you, Madam, and let his absence cost you no more tears.”
Ah, my Lord, ” replied I, ** you widely mistake — I weep not his absence but my own weakness — I am married to another — 1 ought not to refle£i: on him with pleasufe — but, alas I I have been accustomed to regard him from my ‘ childhood — and he has many virtues. He has left
France — { stall never see him more — and I wisti not to see him — alli desire is to blot from my remembrance his image.”
Here 1 wept upon the comte’s stoulder, who had thrown a Supporting arm around me, and was mingling tears with mine. He begged to hear the story — 1 declined relating it — I had no inclination to expose my husband — on the contrary I blamed my own ingratitude in weeping at the idea .of a former lover, when So amiable a man as the Marquis deserved all my affection. The Comte stook his head — I pretended to take no notice of his incredulity. I prayed him to keep the Secret which dhance and my folly had discovered; and discn gauging myself from him, I left the fummer house with precipitation. When I got to my apartment,
I found

I'found Madame De Sanfcerre in it — I threw myself into a chair, and in an agony of tears, I told, her what had happened —
“It would have been ridiculous, ’’cried I,. ** to have denied it after all he had heard — the only way I had left was to make him my friend.” Madame De Sanfcerre was very angry udth me — she said that I behaved like a child — that the Comte had gained from me a very precious Secret,, which sofar from destroying his hopes as a lover, would rather inspire new and more daring ones.
“Ah, my God !” exclaimed I, “how wretch -- CD am I! — what will become of meat last !”
My friend then began to console me — she Spoke reason in its most persuasive language — she made me confess that I was both weak and culpable in Suffering Luzy to become once more an objeq; of rhy meditations. I blushed — I acknowledged, her. justice — Luxy was again to be banished from my idea — .but that talk, to you, I must confess, I never can accomplish. After this she left me to go and make her toilette..

As isboii as i.was alone,, I recolle6l: ed my string, ef pearls — more valuable from its being a gift of. luzy’s,. than from its own costly worth. I destr cd Nannette to gb to the fummer house and look, for my bracelet — she flew — and returned with an assurance that it was not there. i.was almost dif tra^ed. “Ah, ” thought I, ‘‘ it was the only token I ever kept of his love — that Smile — that air with which it was presented!! —, my heediess folly !- — how could I abandon this innocent pledge of the most precious affection 1”
I wept, riamented myself in vain.
The hour approached when I was obliged to join my company in the Saloon, and I endeavoured to assume a more composed countenance than the.
Teal Situatioo of. my heart could well allow of..

As I entered the room where every one was assembled but the Comte D’artois, the Chevalier De Mondonoir approached and led me to a seat, then hanging over my chair. Said to me in a low voice, ‘‘ vvhy, Madam, do you appear pensive? — Something has happened to give you uneasiness!! — 1 — ah, charming Marchioness— — Mondonoir be of of any Service to you —, tax freely my poor power — -1 live but in the hope of making myself one time or other worthy of your esteem.’
The Chevalier, I believe, imagined, that I was unhappy about a new run of ill luck which has pursued Lausanne: : lost to an English nobleman yesterday in Paris, five thousand pounds; and went thither again this day to discharge the debt of honour. — -1 will not stay my pen to animadvert upon So disagreeable a subject— — it is to nopurpefe! — So I will proceed in my story.
i answered the Chevalier in a tone of sprightli nefs which amaxed him, and at once delivered me from being fuspedled of melancholy on any account.
We went to dinner — the Comte D’artois did not appear — he was not to be found — at the concert he was still absent— — Supper he was notpre ent, and everybody concluded that he had left Trois ' Riviere. When we were parting for the night, I took Madame De Sanlcerre by the arm, and as the t moon shone very bright, I proposed to her a walk in the wood — she liked the thought, and we Sallied forth. We had not advanced far into it before! perceived Some one dart through a different part of it, as if to shun our Society — the circumstance Surprised — nay, alarmed us, and we paused for a few moments — however we could not prevail on ourselves to proceed further, and were turned to the eastle where I took leave of Madame De sans
cerre;
\
 07
ccrre; and walked for Some time up and down a gallery which is covered on the top, but is open at the (ides, and goes half round the house. £ had not been there long, when I heard some steps sounding in the gallery — — I could not discover whose they were, for I was q., uite at the other end of it, and they seemed approaching, but at Some distance. From the softness of the tread, I giiesr ed the per Son to be sanscerre, who perhaps had looked into my chamber, and' was uneasy at not finding me there. Prepossessed with this idea, I waited the coming of my friend, but what was my amazement, when instead of her, I beheld the Comte D’artois 1 it was the way to his apartment — that gallery conduced him into a Suite of rooms, at the end of which was situated his bedchamber — it was there he meant to retire, when he was struck with my unexpected appearance.
Good God, Madam !” cried he, do I dream — oris it really the figure of Madame De Lausanne that I now behold
1 was in some confusion at his finding me Sa strangely alone at such an. hour, and in such a place, but answered him with composure and a degree of gravity, which Served to check that air of vivacity and joy, which appeared in his manner on first addressing me. I took my leave almost dire6bly~but not without alking him for the string of pearls, which I had left by accident i the fummer house, and which I flattered myself he had found. He took my hand: — sighed upon it — and exclaimed, “Ah, Madam! those pearls — that happy man! — Madame De Lausanne— — vi<storia, name him to me
** My Lord, ” cried I, ‘‘ this is unjenerous — if I discovered to you the weakness of my Soul, you. may perhaps be ignorant, that I have virtue
Sufficient
I
ri

108
Sufficient to despise that weakness. Name this subject no more, my Lord — I loved long before I knew the Marquis — I never, since my marriage, allowed my imagination to dwell even on the virtues of this amiable man. Those pearls which my woman had accidentally placed oh my toilette, brought him once more to my idea — I remembered him with too much esteem — but it was for the last time. — Never can I again be guilty of so much ingratitude to the excellent Lausanne— — it for ever from your memory, good my Lord — and think justly of my virtues.
I immediately flew from, him, and hurried to my chamber. This morning I received from him the following billet, which enclosed my bracelet.
Sfo the Marchioness De lausanne.
YOUR last words were — think justly of my, virtue.” Too claiming Victoria I honour — I esteem that virtue which ever must be a barrier to hiy hopes, — I have loved you — I here resign that tenderness— — bosom is filled by another ob je6l more amiable — more worthy your regard — the bracelet which I saw you honour with a fond, embrace I now return — I have embraced it to —
I have shed Some fond — Some parting tears on eve ry bead — they had touched your lips I you must in these lines Suffer me to make my adieus — I can fly from your charms — but I cannot stay without adoring them. I beg leave to kifs your hands.”
I need not add that he has left Trois Riviere — and left it without afldng to see me. Madame De Sanfeerre rallies a good deal upon it; and
pretends
I
I '
O F T H E   109
pretends to be very'angry that the most agreeable man of the party should be frightened from us. Solignac looks grave upon this; and enquires not into the cause of his departure, though he is quite out of the Secret, and sanscerre says this is to torment him.
Madame De Sanfcerre has purchased a little estate near this place, whither she has invited all my company to pafs a few days. — I shall steal home alone this night however, in order to enjoy Some hours of peace and Solitude. — The Marquis I expel too from Paris — and he must not be lest alone.

I Was returning Some nights fmce frommadanie De sanfcerre’s, who had given a rural masked ball — and had left the company long before they thought of retiring,, when ray carriage was stopped — was immediately Surrounded, a man with a crape over his face forced me out of it, and stopping my mouth with a handkerchief, seated me in a chaiie which was in readiness near him. — smy agitations are not to be described — — and in the vi» lence of my despair, at a loss how to make my Situation known, I struck my hands against a sore glass with Such earnestness, that I shivered it to atoms. 1 cut my arms and fingers in a terrible manner, the blood which flowed from my wounds in great abundance, alarmed the wretch who had placed himself in the carriage by me, and letting vol.

fall the handkerchief which he had' held to my mouth, I Snatched it from my lap and threw it out of the window. My voice being then at liberty,
I shrieked very loudly, whilst he endeavoured to staunch the blood which streamed plentifully from my arms and hands. At that moment two horsemen appeared with their attendants — and I redoubled my cries — I called for help — for mercy — for protection. They immediately rode up to us, and commanded the postilions to stop at their perils. — They obeyed, when the man that was with me leapt out of the chaise, and - drawing his Sword, desired the gentlemen to keep off as thej valued tbielr lives -- — for in thecaufe in wjiiah he was embarked he could aifail a hoji of Joes, I now began to sufpe6l that I had often heard and dreaded that voice — I perceived it to be no other than the Duke De Mau rice’s, and entreating once more for protection I fell down fenfeless in the carriage. — I remember nothing more that pasted until I found myself at Tfois Riviere in bed, with Madame De Sanfeerre kneeling by my fide in speechless agony. I was willing to believe that i had just awakened from a frightful dream — but my muffled hands and bruised limbs too Soon convinced me of its being a Serious reality. I cannot paint her joy at finding me once more sensible — and after Some inquiries on her part, respedling the commencement of this horrid afhir, she gave me the following particulars. When the gentlemen on horseback discovered that I had fainted; they dismounted, and going to each door of the chaiie, they raised me again on the Scat, from which I had fallen, whilst they Sent off Some of the attendants to the first village, to procure for me theaflistanee of a Surgeon. In the hurry and perplexity of the Scene, the author of this accident Sucured himself by flight, supposing (as they imagine) that I should expire with loss of

blood, before ray wounds could be properly administered to. Soon after a surgeon came who bound them up — and torches having been brought with him, they immediately perceived that I wa the Marquis Pe lausanne’s wife and I was conveyed hither as infensible as if death had really feixed me. The Servants, upon my arrival,, appeared to be half distrafted — and Some of them stew to Madame De sanscerre, who, instantly accompanied by the Marquis, fet off for Trois Riviere, where they found me in bed, and Nannette weeping ever and lamenting me as lost. The strangers who had refeued me, after delivering me up in Safety,, pursued their route, which they Said was to Paris, promistng to return in a day or two to make their inquiries concerning me in per, sbn. lausanne Seemed stocked at.my Situation— — once kneeled by me, and wept plentifully — however he went to Paris the morning after, and did not return until the evening following, when, he Saw me much recovered. The Servants who were with me at the time the affray happened,, have never since been heard of, excepting the postilion who came home early that morning, and protested his innocence of being accessary to it— — Says that he was beaten Severely by one of the russians, and was So disabled from proceeding faster with the carriage, that it was with difficulty he reached the castle when he did. Strict inquiry
has been made after these wretches to little or no

effect— — circumstance that gives me stncereplear Sure.
What can I think, my dear Marla — what am I to suppose? I could swear that the Duke De Maurice alone was the author of So vile a plot — yet th is I would not for the world divulge to any one but ’, ou. — lausanne seems to believe that it was

Madame De sanscerre informs me that the obliging strangers told the particulars of this adventure to Nannette. They appeared by her description, to be the Chevalier De tresac and monsieur De ctranville : two gentlemen who live not many miles from Trois Riviere, and whose affability and worth, have claimed the esteem and admiration of the whole country. My good friend knows them both — and will answer for it, that to them i am indebted.for my miraculous escape.

Madame D e L A u s A N N E., to Madame
D E S A N s C E R R E.
I HAVE beheld the ceremony of making two faithful lovers happy — I was present when Maria bestowed her hand on Lindor — I heard her repeat those vows with delight, which cost me the bitterest tears to pronounce — I Saw him embrace her with the raptures of love — I Saw her receive his caresses with apleasure which sbe took no pains to conceal. Ah, sanscerre, can marriage really wear so delightful a form? — I beheld it once before — but with what different eyes! — despair and horror were my handmaids — and misery presided at the altar: the hours which are here dedicated to mirth and festivity — were then pasted in tears and sadness— — when Lausanne received
me to his arms — the embraces of death would have
0
been more welcome!
Madame De Savillon is the emblem of beauty. She is happy — her Smiles are adorned with a thousand graces — her form is unconstrained — her manners easy. When sbe Speaks to Lindor, her voice is harmony, and sbe Seems to behold him as the most precious gift of heaven. May you, my friend, in bleffmg our Solignac, experience all these ecstatic sensations! may you many years after think of that day, as the sera of your most permanent felicity! — and may it never cease, until fate cuts, the thread of life — and an extreme old age leaves you nothing more to wish for!
My dearest Maria thinks of our Separation with anguisb, Lindor too, at its mention, is distrested ■ — they are all goodness — we have long been the
ssncerest friends— — this last interview wdiich we ■ ■ have
 , 119
have had. Seems to have added if possible to the vast degree of tenderness which we ever possessed for each other.
Madame De vilteneuf is altered for the worse since I daw her — she looks pale and wasted — but her venerable figure loses nothing of its dignity, though it Supports a burden of infirmities. She is happy in Seeing her daughter So, and views lindor with the fond eyes of a parent.
I am called to join in a dance which is given to the villagers: I remember that it was at Such a rural assembly, I sucked in a deadly poison, which to this moment communicates its baleful influence over my heart.. — Ah, ffanscerre! — Madame Du
Parte presented it to me, in the Form of Luzy.

I have been dancing with the young Marquis De Villars — he is very amiable, and his person is an afsembhige of the Graces. He knew Luzy in. Italy — but what is that to the, purpose?? Marquis De Villars was attentive, 1 could perceive, to a pretty blooming damsel, whole innocent heart dreams not of fedu6tion. I heard her tell hiwciy that she was not such .a fool as to believe the. fnerihings he said— — Jhe was a poor girl, and went with her Peep (as happy as they) to the meadows where' they e^ruz.e — that Jhe had never been in Paris in all her lifcy and though it voas a fine place^ ve had no curiofty to see it.
What, no curiosity, ’' cried he, to see how beautifully a frifeur would dispose of these pretty ringlets! — Your eyes, my charming Sophia, are already too brilliant for my peace — but they would receive additional lustre .from the mode .of adornment which you could affiime in Paris.’^

The poor girl curtsted — he took her hand.
“My little Sophy will come with me to Paris I am Sure I”
** No, Sir, ” replied she, ** I do not like to bear of it — poor Sophia is only fit to feed her flock at home— — she desires no better.”
. I could listen to no more at that time, but after a dance in which Sophia had performed with a degree of natural grace and ease, she Seated herself with one of her female companions under a large poplar. — The Marquis De Villars approached her shortly, and taking his place near her, caught hold of her hand.
“And So you will have me die, cruel sophiap’ exclaimed he in a pathetic tone.
** Die, sir! — no, God forbid — I hope I am not So wicked 1”
“Why then, continued he, will you refuse me a request on which more than my life depends ?” “bless me fir!” cried Sophia, “what would you have me do?”
Only, ” replied he, ‘‘ to come with me to Paris — and to Suffer me to make you as fine as any there.”
'“And what would become of. my poor mother
?” answered she.
Why I will make her age comfortable — the parent of my love should never know a want.”
And what would you do for my sheep?” resumed she.
Oh, Some careful shepherd should be employed to look after them.”
“Ah, fir!” cried Sophia, I am Sorry to grieve So fine a gentleman as you — but indeed, indeed I cannot leave my dear mother who is already finking under age and sickness— — knows how to feed her but myself — — nobody can
nurse her like me — besides— — sheep know me,
and
  in
and they would break their hearts if I should leave them. I turn them every morning into their pasture, and go back for them at night — my little brother watches them all day, while I do the business of the house, and attend my mother. To be Sure they would all die, if Sophia could go away from them to be a fine lady.”
During this artless Speech, which was pronounced in the very voice of innocence, the Marquis viewed her with an emotion which I could not but observe. — Her virtue, had affe6ted him — and, be not Surprised if I tell you, the Marquis turned his head aside to wipe from his eyes some starting stears. — He tried her farther.
“But these hands, my pretty Sophy 1 — thesc hands will be Spoiled by labour, ”
No, no, sir, ” answered she, “the hands of a poor girl are made for labour — and my mother tells me, that as long as I continue to be good,
I shall never be ashamed to own that I work for my bread. It would be more to my shame, sir, if I Spared my hands, and Suffered my dear mother, to w«nt their Service.”
** Why, have you not a father, my amiable girl r”
Here Sophia took up her apron to hide her tears — the Marquis was shqcked — he kissed her hand, and asked her pardon.
No, sir, continued she, “no offence” — still covering her eyes. “I will tell you presently.”
The pretty creature, after fame moments pause, addressed him thus:
“My father was the best man in the world — he was kind and faithful to my mother, and loved his children beyond everything, except his honesty. — We were all happy whilst he was with us — but, alas, sir j — we shall never see him again.”

Here sbe Sobbed bitterly — the Marquis was pe.. retrated with Sorrow.
“Your father is dead then, Sophy 1” cried he.
“Yes, Sir, ” Sard she, I arn afraid So. He
had reared by his labour Some cattle, and left us
•/ ^
one day, to carry them to market. We did not expect him home for a week, but at the expiration of that time, we looked out impatiently for his return. — Ah, Sir! — a fortnight passed without any tidings from him — three weeks — a month elapsed in the same way — my poor mother was 'almost chstracfed, and it was with difficulty! Supported her Sorrows, and oun little billy’s cries, without discovering to them my own grief. I endeavoured to cheer them with a hope of his being still living — but, alas! I am afraid it is a vain one,, for it is more them a year Since the fatal day of his leaving Oiir cottage.”
** You do right, my dear Sophy, ” answeredi the Marquis, to hope the best — Who knows; but God still fpareshim to his wife and children !”
“Ah, Sir, returned she “were you to see, how sadly ray mother bears his absence!! — is that which has reduced her to stcknefs and melancholy — her poor heart is almost broken. — .She has a chair placed on moon light nights outside of the
house, in which she seats herielf, with her face; ^ /
turned towards the path, which my father took, when he left us — there she woeps and calls upon him to return — I often hear her lamentations,, vvhen 1 am busy in giving Billy his supper, and preparing some for ourselves— — fitch times I amc forced to hide my face from my brother, or he would find out that my heart was breaking too — anti it is by my ehearfulne ss lie is convinced our father will soon come back.” ' •

YO U are happy, my Maria, and my wishes are Satisfied. — I can easily forget that I am myself wretched, when I reflet that Lindor and you are at length united; my own woes, at that thought, remain unwept — and a Smile of joy dif fuses itself over my countenance. You desired me to write you all — you charged me to Suffer nothing to pass untold — well then, my Maria, I must, in obeying, cost you Some few tears — you will let them drop when you learn that the Marquis is really cruel to me, and that I know not how I have deserved Such treatment.
The night I arrived in Paris, after having bid you and my friends at Villeneuf castle adieu, I was met almosthn the court yard by Madame De san feerre; upon inquiring of her for my husband, she told me, that he had been absent two days from town, but was expected that evening to return. I will not tell you that this intelligence
rather

rather displeafed me — you would be angry were I to say so — and I believe with reason. We retired to my dressing room, where sbe amused me with a thousand anecdotes that happened in the Beau Monde Since my quitting it; and in my turn I gave an account of our pleaiiires at Villeneuf. We chatted and laughed away Some hours, until we were told that Supper was Served — we expe6ted to be joined by Solignac then; and in passing to the eating room, we heard his carriage drive in, and Saw him enter Soon after. Our mirth encreaied. upon this agreeable acquisition to our Sociable party, and we enjoyed ourselves with no less gaiety than innocence. When Supper was ended we prevailed on Madame De Sanicerre to give us an Italian Song which sbe had studied in my absence, and after her, Solignac and I obliged her with Some pretty airs in our turn. We were thus happy when the door opened — and the Marquis De lau fanne appeared. We arose to receive him, and I approached to pay him my compliments, meaning at the Same time to embrace him — but I was stopped short by a coldsbow, and Some ridiculous fine Speech; which when he had ended, nobody I believe could guess the meaning oh In return I Said Something of being biappy to see him look so ■welly and in presenting him ‘with the compliments of Madame De Villeneuf y and those of the conte and Madame De Savillon — again he bowed — and Soon after with one more general, he quitted the apartment. Solignac upon this, took his leave, and sanscerre and I were left once more to ourselves.
We had not been long alone, when a Servant came to inform me,, that the Marquis begged to see me in his study. I immediately went thither, and found him Sullenly Seated at a writing table.. He never arose at my entrance — he affe6sed, in
F 3 deed.

deed, to take no notice of my being in the room. — I had sat sslently very near half an hour waiting his pleasure, when the fatigue of my journey induced me to wish for rest, and in as cautious a tone as possible, lest I should disturb his meditations, I begged to know whether he had anything particular to communicate to me? He stood up — he viewed me froai head to foot with an air of disdain nd coldness— — astced, vehtiher I was impatient to join again my merry jet ^so much joy as not to spare him a Pw minutes of my company P He added, that it was not the frfi proof i had given him of my indifference, but by Heaven he would malde me dif gwje those fentimemts of averfmi, or know a reafoti for the contrary.
1 was astonished — the man appeared to me, to be in a phrent&y. I told him, that he did me injustice — that I came to him with pleasure— — aa he took no notice of my presence, I judged it necessary to inform him, that I was waiting to know his ecimmands. I said that he could not wonder at my not much relishing to stay, where I was not even spoken to, but that I was then ready to listen to whatever he chose to impart.
. ** Madam, -’ returned he, ** the admiration of princes, dukes, and comtes has disturbed that poor vain head of thine — you pretend to fatyriste me for not being fensvble of your awful approach — you may now walk out of the room. Madam, -- I want nothing of you — nor could I expedf anything from you, but the degree of constdence I have found.”
1 immediately advanced towards the door — he caught hold of my arm with malice in his eyes.
** Hold, Madame De Lausanne 1.^ — you are t'h * pesed tomorrow to make your appearance at verfaules' — I destre you will lay that hope assde — I am to be duped no longer — kings are pretty conquests

quests for a Udy to make — but lausanne’s wife Shall diid<iin every other, but that which sbe once could claim over her husband's heart. — Begone from my Sight!”
This last Speech was Spoken in an ironical tone until he came to that part, where I was commanded from his presence — his voice then arose to a key of pastionate discord, and I flew from it faster than I would have stone from the roaring of an angry lion.
When 1 gained my chamber, I found sanscerre in it, and undreffest — we dilmifsed our attendants — sbe waited form in the utmost expediation^i was ready to faint with fear and grief, and throwing myself intoa chair, sbe administered to me drops and volatiles until I was in some measure restored. Her friendly heart Sent forth a shower of tears to her eyes, that fell in large drops on my hands, which, whilst I was incapable of articulation, sbe frequently, prested to her lips in anguisb. At length, when I revived sufficiently to explain my Situation, I related to her all that had pasted — but then, alas! — we could do no more than weep, over, the wretchedness of my fate.
The next morning Sanfeerre and Isbreakfasted. in my 'apartment, and upon Madame De lau trec’s calling on me to accompany me in my carriage to Versailles as we had proposed, I sent her word by Nannette, that I was confined with a cold ■ and fever to my roonj, and was forty that it was - not in my power to wait upon her. The Marquis it seems heard this mestage, and called out loud enough for the elegant Marchioness not to }ofe a fytlable of what he uttered.
“It is false— — is very well. Let her not be asbafnest to own, that her husband has forbidden her journey to the court — he wdll never be duped — the world shall know he will not.”

Madame De Lautrec, Nannette said, sbruggcd her shoulders— — desiring her compliments to me, hurried out of the house.
The Marquis Soon after lent me the foliowi*? billet.
“I should be glad to know. Madam, who those two Cavaliers were, who attended you from Madame De sanfcerre’s in the country, to Trois Riviere, and were So happily your champions as to Secure you against the violence of a third admirer? — You best can tell the name of that third invader of my honour — of your virtue — him, however, you did not favour with your preference — therefore, he is not worth my vengeance. — But 1 desire you will unravel the mystery which hangs over the description of your deliverers. They merit my thanks for their services— — whilst I wear a sword, i will not lay under an obligation to them.! expect your answer — I wait for it.

Soon after the receipt of my answer, he left home — and though it is two days Since his absence, we have neither heard from, orleen anything of him.

Several letters from Madame De sansctrre to ' Mawa are onhtted, in which she gives an
account

account of luzy’s death, and the dangerous Situation of Madame De lausanne, who at the time of her writing (which was in the course of Several weeks) was delirious, and So ill, as to afford very little hope of her recovery. On her getting better she resumes the pen as follows:
TELL me, my Maria, where are now those gay prospe6ts which appeared to me, when together we rambled through the woods of Clarence, and had Luzy and Lindor perpetually by our Sides? then did we wish for nothing more— — did we look forward with pleasure, and every day was happier than the last. It was then, my Maria, I Saw Luzy without fear — that I professed to love him without dread. — How little did I think I should have become the wife of lausanne -- and that Luzy would have found a watery grave! — My prospects have indeed been blackened — have indeed been altered! — May yours, my Maria, ever retain their present brightness!! — nothing overshadow them!

Madame De sanscerre has given me the portrait of Luzy, which I Sometime ago insisted upon presenting to the Comte De Solignac. — I write with it placed before me. — The pidfure Seems to Speak — it appears to (mile — that smile, my Maria — ah, what sweetness— — beauty is in that smile— — the painter could not doit justice — my heart which bears a more faithful resemblance of him, gives to his charming countenance those graces which the cold pencil of a limner never could have touched. — Where now are those warm — those animated beauties, which spoke So fensibly the feelings of the noblest heart,

I KNOW not where to begin, my dear Maria — I am all horror, confusion and grief I — our Victoria is quite delirious — she has adorned her head with flowers fet off in the most fanciful manner — — her bosom she has decorated in the same Simple style — all to the difference of one string of pearl, which she has tied around her neck — in her hand she bears the portrait of Luzy, which she addresses in heartrending accents. — The Marquis is happily from home — he has not returned Since he received her answer to his cruel letter. Heaven gompose her mind before he revisits Paris! — Hark! — I hear her voice — she is coming into my room.

She advanced towards me, with a stow and mournful step — her eyes were riveted to the floor — she came up quite close to me before she observed me. I took her hand.
“My Vidloria, ” cried I, “do you not fe your Sanfeerre? — do you not know your friend ?’*
She
136
She started — she looked steadfastly at me — my eyes were suffused in a torrent of anguish — my heart was bursting. The charming creature pas fed her hand over my face — she found it wet with tears.
‘‘ Ah, ” Said she, “you weep? — why do you weep? has any one cause but me? — yet See my eyes are dry. — People tell me that I am married — nay, they accuse me of murdering lausanne — but indeed, indeed they wrong me — I never murdered but one in my life — and him I behold now !” — looking wildly towards the opposite Side of the room. — “Ah, my Lord!” — added the poor distra£led vi6loria, and she fell on her knees with clasped uplifted hands— — “my Lord — forgive me — it was my father — it was my mother who commanded. l.uzy, I always loved thee — I now love thee though in thy cold grave, better than all the world I”
I flew to her — I endeavoured to raise her from the ground. Her eyes were fixed — her ideas Seemed absorbed in the contemplation of some interesh ing obje<st — she continued firm in her position— — could all my strength avail in ashsting td remove her from it. Some minutes were thus Spent, wlien Sue Sprang up Suddenly, and, throwing her arms around, my neck, she hid her face in my bosom.
“Ah, he is dying now!” exclaimed she;
his groans — his cries I — oh, who will Screen me from them? — this hand” — added she, showing me her right hand, “this hand struck him to the heart — I gave the blow— — gave it to Luzy !”
Here she fainted, and Nannette and I conveyed her to her chamber, where she has been in a profound steep ever Since.
Nannette has just told me, that the marquis’^s valet, whom he took with him out of town, it
arrived.
OF THE R O C K. 137
arrived, and Says his lord will soon be in Paris — he is expeffed momently. Good God, my dear Savillon! what will become of her, if in this cruel delirium, the Situation of her soul should be exposed before her tyrannic husband? — A carriage drives into the court — it is him — Adieu.
I MET the Marquis as he entered thehoufe — he Silently — and something Sullenly, Saluted me — he passed me in order to go to his study — I took the liberty of following him thither.
“My Lord, ” said I, “the Marchioness is very ill — a violent fever has brought her almost to the brink of the grave — she is nov out of her senses— — in all probability a very short time will put a final period to her Sufferings.”
He turned pale — he was shocked ** Why,. Madam, ” Said he in a tremulous tone, “Why was I not made acquainted with her indilposition sooner" "
“my Lord, ” cried I, rather too warmly, “1 know not where Madame La Bert lives in the country.”
He started — he Seemed to take fire — but I keep his Spirit a little under — and without affesfing to take notice of his resentment, I turned upon my heel, and left him to cool upon it alone.
It was not long before he entered her apartment — she was asteep — and I was bathing her dear hands with the teats of affection, when he approached her bed. He viewed her in silence for Sometime — then in a whisper demanded the reason of her head’s being So attired? I said it was her

wandering fancy which had chosen to have it So adorned — and that I thought it would be cruel to cross So harmless a desire. He turned aside to wipe away his tears. She Soon after stirred — and in a few minutes opened her eyes — they unluckily took in at once the person of the Marquis who stood opposite to her, and direflly as sbe beheld him, sbe Screamed with violence.
‘‘ Ah!” cried he, “unhappy wretch! — lam, indeed, unworthy to appear before the face of innocence. — Pardon, pardon me, vi£tor4a !” — do you know me and he fell sbn his knees before her. She arose in the bed, and looking stedfaftiy at him- -- -- -

The Marquis pressed her burning bands to Ids lips, and bedewed it with his tears.
She had now forgot that any one was present, and teetried to be muttering to herself— — was pulling to pieces the flowers that adorned her bosom, and sbattering them around her couch. She at length happened to feel the string of pearls sbe had tied about her neck — at the end of which, it Seems, sbe had, in my absence, fastened the portrait of Luzy. The pi^urc hung low in her bosom, and had before escaped my observation — but, alas! 1 was made to See it too Soon. — When the marchioness perceived the pearls, sbe untied them, and took them from her neck, and in doing £0, sbe discovered the miniature, which bears lb strong a resemblance to what her lover was.

The Marquis never interrupted her during her meditation of the picture. His countenance, however, wore the marks of astonishment and anxiety. When he believed her to be in a fast ssumber, he advanced to the bead of her bed with infinite caution, and putting his hand upon the string of peark — he brought forth the portrait from her bosom— — put it into his own without once looking at it — and hurried with it to the other end of the room.

The carriage is at the door — everything is ready for my departure — I can hardly prevail on my foolish pen to wtile the word Adieu. — My tears blot my paper — and the thought of never Seeing thee more, rends my fond heart. — Sanfeerre stands weeping near my Side — my mother’s picture, which is now before me, appears to feel my grief nannette’s is the only cheerful countenance * see — and hers is only So, because she has leave to attend her unfortunate mistress— — am 1 delaying — yet it must be written.
Adieu, then, my best beloved — my dearell Maria! — Love me — think of me — and receive in idea a last embrace from thy

I NOW write from mv own house, and will en deavour to describe our last farewell. — It was tender, melancholy and Solemn. After having Sealed your letter, she gave me her hand, and we walked into her oratory. — There we kneeled — and offered to heaven the sacrifice of distressed and Sorrowful hearts. For my part, my tears fre .quenily interrupted my oraisons — whilst hers Seemed to be pronounced with a composed fervour, which raised my admiration. When we had Spent Some time there, we adjourned to her dref sing room, where presenting me with her picture, sbe embraced me with affection. -- -- - — —
“Let me always postefs your regard, my sanf cerre, ” cried sbe, but forget my misfortunes 1 — In Solitude 1 shall be once more happy. — I shall there indulge refleflion — and study to obtain true resignation to the will of God.” — I answered only with a flood of grief. — “Fie, sse, ” added she,
where is thy foi titude? — what do you Say to rrie, who have lost for ever the object in the world most dear to my Soul? — We may meet again ■ — but him I never more shall look on! — yet behold — I weep not 1”
The marquis’s voice we heard at that instant — we thought he had left Paris — but it Seems his ab ^ was only to avoid expostulation. She started at the sound — fire threw her arms around my neck — she made me a thousatid adieus; then breaking from me, she hurried out of the apartment. I follow’’ed, however, and Saw her fall on her knees to the Marquis and heard her bid him farewell.
Begone, begone T’ cried the wretch, no more of this.”
No, my Lord, ” replied she, no more —. only to entreat you to do justice to my fame, and do not injuriously blast it for ever. — I am inno vol. ll. G cent, ’^

She quitted the room with an air of dignified dtstrefs, and stepped? amidst a weeping multitude, into the carriage that was to convey her, from Paris — from all her connexions for ever, Good.dod — my Sorrow is?poignant!

\
madamep>y. Savillon.
IN the island of Sardinia, is your vi61oria arriv ved, after a journey and a short voyage, which both fatigued and terrified her. — I was not aware of being obliged to come So far, or my spi rits could not have Supported me with the firm ness they did on my leaving France. — And yct, my dear Maria, what does it all Signify? — where is the difference of existing in an obscure retreat, or in living in Splendour, when the heart is insensible to enjoyment — is dead to pleasure?? I had been destined, to take up my habitation in the coldist mountain of Savoy, I would have prefer,, it to the noise and glare of Paris. — Since one Fatal day — since the day on which 1 learned that Luzy was no more — 1 have shut out frora my mind even the appearance of delight. — If I can at lejfigth bring myself, to a state of calm indifference, all will be well — and I shall have no further wish to make.
The castle to which I have been Sent, is an ancient and magnificent building — its form is gothic — and its strudture awfully grand. The furniture is old, and the iron grates to most of the windows cast a horrid gloom over every apartment. It is Situated near the seashore,, and the melancholy sound of the foaming Surge inspires the most Solemn, yet the most pleasing ideas.. — To me,, they are pleasing, for they sooth yet indulge my Sorrow.
ft
We were met, at the entrance of its gites, by a venerable figure, who saluted us with a degree of gravity and austerity befitting an inhabitant of
G 3 this
ISO
t
this dreary solitude. His locks were white, and his furrowed cheeks befpokc his long fojournment in this wretched world.
When we alighted from the carriage, a female, no less ancient than the man I have just deferibed, hailed me, asmistrefsof the manston. The poor creatures behaved well — they stretched to the utmost of their power, their voluble abilities, in order to cheat our Spirits from their depressed situa ation. They took us over the castle that night — and I dismissed them, as Soon as decency would permit, in order to give a loose to the distresses of my soul.
Nannette, whom I must ever love and refpest, bussed herself immediately, in direfiking and feeing to, the preparations of those refreshments which she judged would be the most proper, for me to take — and she at once blended the useful Servant, yith the delicate sentiments of a sympathising friend.
_
When I had shut myself up im the apartment I had chosen— — heart seemed to burst. fortein an agony of grief — I remembered my mothers tendcr ncls — I recalled my fathers love for his VI Aoria — I recollected thy friendship — I went back to those happy Scenes we Spent together at Clarencd.
‘‘ Ah, ’’ cried I in the bitterness of my anguish. “Ah, is it polssble that this beloved object— — darling child — this still dear friend should be held unworthy of Society — and should be banished for ever from the world! — It is not the world that has charms, “added I, ” my wretched Soul can bear witness to my love of retirement — but it is the ignominy which must be cast upon my name, and pursue me even to this solitary place that I lament.”
My dear Maria, I will not dwell upon the ijcfsof my restedlons — Suffice it to say, I went to
bed
t
OF T H.D   151
bed early, at the importunity of Nannette, though steep denied to vistt So miserable a creature.
When I arose the next morning, I repaired to the windows of my chamber, - and I perceived that they looked down upon the Sea. The prost pe£l was a fine one, for Some vessels that were pasting, in full sail, added a thousand charms to the beauty of the morning — the castle is embosomed in a large thick wood — and from the front of it, you perceive nothing of that tremendous ocean, which the back part exhibits to the eye and ear. I will own that, at first, the sight stiocked me — the fate of the unhappy Luzy, was strongly pi^ured to my senses— — with clasped hands I shrieked out in despair. — Pardon me, my Maria 1^ — it was inded a folly — but alas my reason is weakened by afhifkion.
I grow fonder of my situation every hour — it suits the gloomy horror of my Soul. — I tead — I ivotk — I write. — i"forget the world in general — I '’remember with delight but few. — My dear Savil ion, what matters it, whether your vitoria be in Italy or in Paris? — She saw you but Seldom xvhen France was her place of residence— — surely, she will hear of and from you now, with no less pleasure than she did, before So niany leagues divided
Adieu, my Maria! — be happy — and believe, that it is notin the power of any earthly being to make thee less dear to thy

Julia De Sanscerre to Madame De
Savillon.
YOU dessre me to inform you of all, concerning the Marquis: you desire me to be particular in everything relating to him: you hope that time, and the rcfleflion of our Vi: oria’s patience, will restore him to reason and to virtue. Alas, my Maria, you are deceived!
As Soon as a week had elapsed, after the mar chioness’s absence, Mademoiselle Le Blanc, took postesfion of his hotel, in the Rue de Condd where our friend had presided, with So much beauty and elegance.
Madame La Bert is not his favourite mistress— — sbe is thought to give rather too much ear ' — too mi ch encouragement, to the Chevalier De Granville. — The Marquis, however, winks at that— — it is supposed, that he is indebted to her Some considerable Sums.
I met him the other morning in the Luxembourg — he was walking with his mistress— — dared to Salute me — I returned not his Salute. — solig nac Soon after Saw him — again he pulled off his hat with a grace — Solignac took no notice of it. — The poor man is heartily despifed, and herds chiefly now with opera singers — dancers — Le Blanc — and Madame La Bert.
The Comte D’ A -- -- -- s asked me a few days
ago what was become of my friend? — I Said that She had prevailed on the Marquis to suffer her to ^ enjoy a conventual life. — He shook his head.
Ah, charming Sanfcerre, I want faith.’*
** I am Sorry for it, ” was my reply.
In this instance, ” answered he.
“We will not dispute about that matter, my Lord, ” cried I, “bliti do assure you, that she
has
OF THE R O CD. 153
has left Paris with the best intentions in the world.”
‘‘ Yes, ” exclaimed he, “I believe,. with the intention of obeying the commands of an imperious husband. Lovely Vifloria !” — and, after a pause, it is a thousand pities! — Madame de sanf cerre i will pay her a visit. In what part of Italy, shall I find her ?”
You may before I did not inform him, but this will Serve to convince you, that the affair has taken wind — from whom I know not, unless it be from the Marquis.
'The Duke De Maurice is constantly' in publicc with the comteffede — — — .He Seems to have for gotten those beauties in the Marchioness which never have been equalled — and which he used to a door with Such obfeqioufnefs. He has found. I t believe, a kinder mistress— — at the same time has taken much trouble from vi6toria’s mind...
The entertainments that Le Blanc, gives, are, it is said elegant beyond measure. She lives in a style that few can vie with. — She is abandoned to » profligacy, and will be the ruin of Lausanne,,
has written to entreat me to give my hand to Solignac — but things are not cometo that yet. — After all I dread matrimony, and have no ’ obje6iion to try his patience a little longer — ^be sides, we are both at present in fiiicere affliction — his love for Luzy transcended everything I ever heard of — and mine for our Vidloria shall not be ■ outdone.

The poor people whom I found here, have
been as miserable as'myself; only that their Ioffes have been in Some measure Supplied to them — whilst mine are beyond hope, ans lie hid in the bosom of the grave. — Who can restore to me a father — a tender piother? who can bless my eyes with the sight of, that object, far dearer to me than life — or peace itself? — Ah, irripostible I I have Survived my parents — I have Survived Luzy ‘ — what more does this world contain, that I can wisti to live for? — nothing, - my Savillon — not even thee — for in the arms of Lindor thou canst not want my Iriendsbip. — Yet religion — divine and awful religion has stayed my hand r the God who made has Suffered for me. — He bore his weight of Sorrow without complaint — Sustained it without a murmur. That idea, my Maria I — is not that idea'sufficient to stop the rash hand of repining nature — yes — my God!

I had strolled into the wood yesterday, when I heard the voice of sadness at a distance. My' steps, involuntarily, bent towards the Spot from whence it proceeded — and in a few minutes I discovered an elderly woman decerrtly attired, sitting under a clump of trees— — hand Supported her head, whilst the other held an handkerchief, which she frequently applied to her eyes, to wipe away the tears that fell plentifully from them. I stopped to confider this unhappy objeq; a little while, when I heard her exclaim, “Ah tuoe is me, ’wretched mother I ’ — better had it been, if I hacu ■ died'before Ifaw the liffht of heaved
This shocked mfe, and I approached her.

“Have courage, ’^ resumed I, I will not hurt thee — I came to give thee comfort — .and to teach thee that whatever heaven is pleased to ordain for as, we should Support with patience.”

What is the matter?” demanded I, greatly affected; What is the matter? — Tell me — can I relieve thee ?’*
“Ah, no!” answered she, you cannot relieve me — God only can.” — and she lifted her Sorrowing eyes to heaven. — I took her hand.
“God then, ” cried I, must be implored A

After some moments Spent in Silent devotion, she pointed her finger towards a cottage, which 1 perceived to be not many paces from us. I arose, and following her, she led me into a neat thatched dwelling, where I beheld a young man Seemingly in the agonies of death, stretched upon a bed, and. and a girl, not more than fifteen years old, pale and emaciated with sickness, looking in Silent Sorrow at her brother, without being able to rise from a Seat, in which she had been placed before a window for the benefit of air. The old man who belonged to the castle, was kneeling by his fide, and exhorting the youth to call upon God — > and my amiable Nannette was chaffing his temples, and endeavouring to, bring him to himself“
“” cried the good woman, when we entered, ** there lies my Son, in the last extremity of a fever — and here is my poor daughter, who will Soon follow her young companion, and leave mechildlefs and destitute of all comfort !”
Oh, my Maria, what a Scene 1 — Be astured that my own misfortunes were forgotten.
There was no medical affistancc' to be had for many leagues off — and if there was, we were at a loss how to procure it — for neither Nannette dr I would have known the way, and the old people were not able to take the stightcst journey. Suffice it to say, that, with heaven’s help, and our, attention, the young people grew better, and they are now in a fair way of recovery. A cloud, however, still hung over the mother’s brow — and I often Saw her look at Nannette for some minutes, and then turn aside to wipe away her tears. — I was interested, by her behaviour, to know the reason of her affliction;; ordering her family to be removed to the castle, I appointed one evening for affecibling the old couple, their daughter,
her

her children, and Nannette together, in my apartment, that I might learn the history of the good woman, whose sorrow touched me to the soul. I will endeavour to give it you in a few
words, and without farther digression.

Wood cutter and his Family.

/
** father and mother, ’* Said the poor
IV. woman, are now present” ” to the aged pair, and in order to introduce my life, I must give a Iketch of theirs.
“My father was a wood cutter in Savoy, he’ had married the daughter of a sbepherd, who had more honesty than wealth, and a very numerous family. My father was young and loved my mother, and they hoped by industry to make.amends for the favours fortune had denied their parents. They had been united a year, when a Son encreased their little housbold, and cemented that fondness, which had hitherto been the pride of their hearts, and which they would have boasted to profess for each other, though they had been even poorer than they were. In two years after, I was bora — and was received with still more joy than they felt on my brother’s entrance into the world. — Heaven smiled upon their labours, and their little store increased with their family. As I grew up, the gift of beauty was bestowed upon me — ami the
woods of Savoy reechoed with my praises. The
young
 59
young’fliephcrds who fed their flocks upon the mountains, would often leave them to gaze upon me, when I would accompany my father and brother to pickup the sticks they would sell for that purpose. It was one of these excurstons that, fol iov/ing my father late into the wood, I was accosted by a young man, more beautiful than any of the shephcrds L had Seen — andrnore tender and timid in his manner than any of the youths in our village. He called me charming Nannette, and begged to attend me to my father. I blushed — yetrefufed him not — and when we arrived at the ipot where my father was, he introduced himself as a stranger, who happening to pafs that way, was struck with my appearance, and wished to see me safe at the end of my journey. From that day, this lovely’stranger was constantly at our cottage, and, I need not Say, got Soon poffestion of my young heart.”
Here the good woman burst into a shower of tears. •
It was not long, ” rfefumed she, ** before he obtained my consent to marry him, and my parents, who Saw my affe^ion for him, made n objeflion to our union. Not long after my marriage, my husband proposed our fettling in france where his parents were — and though the parting, with mibe, cost me a thousand pangs, yet I would have endured still greater, to give him comfort.
- When we arrived at a village not far from Avignon, we were met by bis father and brothers, \ who behaved kindly to me at first, and allotted me a cottage, where cohn had lived before 1 married him. Here I spent many happy days, and was blested with a boy and two girls, and should have lived there in felicity for ever, but that it pleased heaven to visit me with astiv<5tion.
had sent my eldest girl out into the mea dew one day with her father’s breakfast, and ex
s pe filed

peftest every moment her return. — But alas! — it was to no purpose— — child did not appearand, ah, Madam! 1 have never seen her since— — her father’s coming back, I alked him for Bibby? — He had not seen her. Oh, my God, | can I ever forget what I endured at those words!
I flew into the village half distradted — I called upon my poor babe — I called upohmy little Bibby to return — Ah, my child was out of her mother’s 1 reach — was gone beyond redemption! my huf ' band Soon after, sickened and died — his heart had been fet upon our lost child — and he expired with ' grief at her absence. His barbarous relations turned me and my two remaining infants, from our dwelling, and bade me go starve with them upon the mountains of Savoy.
I was now in despair, and knew not what to do, to give them food. We wandered many rhiles quite Spent with thirst and hunger — when wearied out at length, I laid me down under a tree, and taking my little ones in my arms, we fell into a profound sleep. When we awoke, my daughter cried for Something to eat — and begged me to put a bst of bread into her mouth.”
“Alas, ssster I” Said Colin, “our mother has nothing to give us: See she is hungry hcrfelfl — don’t cry — God will Send us Something presently— — if he don’t, we shall go to sleep as I did just now, and forget it again.”
This Speech made my heart bleed — and embracing them both, I got up to go in Search of a brook, in order to bring a little water to their parched lips. In my way, I met a countryman, whom I emplored relief from. The good man heard my story with attention, and following me to the place where my poor children lay, expest ing me, he took the girl in his arms., and I followed
• him,
OF T H E R O C K. ii
f
%
him, leading my fori by the hand to his little dwelling, where we were made more welcome than I ever had been ssnce I left my father’s house. He was himself going into Savoy in a day or two afterwards, and promised to conduct us safe to my father’s habitation.
When we arrived there, I found these dea: r parents in deep afflistion for the loss of my brother who had died Some weeks before our departure from France. They, however, forgot not in their grief for him, their tenderness for me.
“Here, Madam, we lived for the Space of ten years, when my Son and daughter (who were our only Supports from the age and infirmities of my father) caught an ague and fever, and though they used to work in order to conceal their illness - at length broke out too violently for restraint, and they were obliged to take to their beds. At this time, two young gentlemen stopped in their way through our village, and hearing our wretched story, one of them writ to the Marquis De laufanne’s steward, to beg the employment of keeper of the castle Au Bois in Sardinia for my father, which was immediately complied with, and he receives an annual Sum of fifty pounds for his maintenance. The gentlemen furnished us with money and everything necessary to defray the expenses of our travelling hither with ease to to my poor children, and they have allowed me for my life an annuity of five and twenty pounds, which is conveyed to me by the same hand that pays my father his wages.
** Here, Madam, my narration ceases— — in what words can I express my .gratitude towards you, and that excellent young worrian, for your humanity in Saving my children, when the violence of their disorder had nearly robbed me of them for ever l— — is one circumstance which
I can
i6z
I" cannot but explain, since you, Madam, ha\«j observed it; which is, my having been often ah fe6led at the sight of .Nannette. The striking likeness she bears to the infant I lost at Avignon, as well as to my husband, frequently raised in my mind feme flattering hopes: — but I dare not presume to think it post!ble : — her parents, no doubt,. are richer people.”
** Ah, no!” cried Nannette, falling on her knees before her; I have no parent, unlessyou are one — -1 never knew who was my mother — who was my father!” '
The good woman embraced her tenderly,
** Have you, ” cried she, the raarki of a rofe bud on your left shoulder ?” ’
*‘?ah I I am yours,, 1 am yours I” exclaimed Nannette, “I have found my mother!” and she threw herself into her arms.
All that Nannette can remember is having been told, when the old Marchioness De Montmorenci brought her to Paris, that she was a foundling, and had been taken up by their coachman in the
streets of Avignon. ^
Montmorenci!” .repeated the wood cutter’s daughter, “Good God! that coachman was no other than one of my husband’s brothers, who in stealing you from rae meant to revenge an injury he once fancied that 1 had done him. — Accept my thanks, bh, gracious heaven! for having found
my child — my dear Bibby I”
This fortunate difeovery, gives me almost as much pleasure, as it does Nannette. I have not experienced so great fatisfaclion, for a length of time. You, who know her worth, will participate in our joy. She is very like her mother, with this difference, that Nannette is not quite so handsome as that worthy woman appears to have h e en.

The Marquis De Lausanne to the Chevalm
De Bayonne,
I HAVE lost immense Sums, my good friend —
I am almost ruined !- — the marchioness has it in her power to assist me by giving up that part of her fortune which her father put, out of my reach to touch, and which he referyed Solely for her own use. She supposes it is by my order that she IS poorly attended in Sardinia, and has no equipage, she therefore confines herself to the trifling remittance of three hundred a year, and consents to receive shat from me. To say the
truth.

truth, I am in doubt whether she knows of the disposition of her father’s will — if she does not, she thinks she is indebted to my bounty for the Scanty pittance I allow her; whereas, she can, iia fa61, command more than I am worth.

The face of stie marquis’s affairs begin to
alter visibly— — is no longer the most gay — the most dissipated man in Paris. — He is fallen — gloomy — pensive. leelanc is, though still at
his house, Seldom Seen with him — and the last time
^ ~ *
'I met her on the Thuilleries, the young Comte, De Manille was her principal escort. Ft is said, that she is drawing him into her shares — for it is whispered, that the marquis’s finances cannot long Support her extravagant method of living, and his own expenses at play. — nay, sougnac was told by an intimate friend of his, that this unfortunate man was already beginning to feel the griping hand of poverty. You best know whether Victoria should be acquainted with this circumstanee. I think, the Marquis looks ill — he is pale — thin — emaciated. He appears an obje6l; of wretchednefs, and us often with Madame La Bert, who loves him ‘enough to adhere to him in distress. I believe he sufpe6fs nothing of his favourite Le blanc’s infidelity; he has been attached to her to a degree of infatuation, and would ill brook Such a piece of information.
Madame De villcneuf’s relapse affords rae a : share of Sorrow, which friendship alone can be susceptible of. I would fly to^comfort you, and partake in your attendance on the reverend invalid, but that the most perplexing affairs confijnc me in Paris. These lawsuits are terrible things, and
mine mustsbe Some time ere they are concluded,
for
  isj
for they depend upon circumstances too tedious, and too difficult to suffer me to hope for a rcleafa from them Soon. ^
Your determination of vistting Vidlorla when Madame Madame. De villeneuf’s health will ad adrait of your absence, is, allow me to say, a scheme that Speaks more warmth of soul than reason— — would not wish it — and nothing but the most implicit obedience to his commands, and patience on her fide, can ever world a reconciliation with her husband. A reconciliation, which every friend of hers must wish to take place. Shoukl the Marquis see at length his errors, and our fair Vidloria be disposed to forgive his late unkind treatment, a circle of happy years may yet await her. .Dis desire that she should have no companion with her in her solitude, was cruel — hut his permitting the best f Servants to attend her was, at the same time. Some Comfort to her and us. Nannette is as good as^e is faithful, and I shall ever love her, for her attachment to she Marehionefs.
Farewell — I will write to you soon, should any
tking happen worth relating. I am, dear Maria

Good God! my amiable friend! I tremble
whilst I write — such a Scene! — but take the particulars. I had gone last night to the Italian .opera, and expel: ed, on my return, Madarne De Sentville and Solignac to Sup with me. They made it late before they came; but upon their arrival we led immediately to supper— — dishes were Scarcely removed, when one of my Servants hurried in to tell me, a messenger, from the Marquis De lausanne begged leave to Speak with me, on an event that could not brook delay. My two friends advised me to send for the man, and see him in their presence; as 1 could perceive that Solignac did not much like my receiving him alone, i.ordered him to be shown into the apartment, where we were altembled. I cannot describe to you my astonishment, upon finding that it was Seraut, who appeared in a Situation that no words can do justice to. He was in a tremor from head to foot — his eyes ran over with tears — .his face was paler than ashes, and his whole figure an emblem of horror and grief.
“Ah, Madam!” cried he hardly able to articulate, “my poor lord is at length become a victim to his irregularities, and the most abandoned of women.”
“What mean you interrogated Solignac.
** Give me your patience, my Lord, ” replied he, “and I will explain myself. The Marquis was going home this night from Madame La bert’s, where he had lost considerably to the Chevalier D’elheu — he was going home dispirited and out of temper, when the first objesls that struck his eyes on entering mademoisclle Le
blanc’s
  i6g
blanc’s apartment, was the Comte De Manille at her feet, and this false woman, encircling his neck with her fair arms as he kneeled. Such a Sight would have been sufficient, at any time, to, have exasperated him — but in the dilposition he was then, it roused him to madness. He approached them in a fury — he cursed her with all the emphasss of rage and disappointment. He turned upon his rival, and after loading him with the appellations of betrayer — villain — and base invader of his rights, bade him defend himselst The Comte did not require (uch a charge to draw his Sword — it was half out of the Scabbard when my Lord called him villain, and they fought like men whole all was depending on Viistory. To be Short, my Lord Marquis received Several wounds, and was covered with the blood of them, before he would give up the cause. At length, after hurting the Comte in the Side, and in the Sword arm, they both fell together. The Comte De Manille was speechless when I came away — but my Lord talks with reason, with grief, with penitence.
“Go, Seraut, ” cried he, when I put him to bed, and a Surgeon had examined his wounds,
** Go Seraut, and beg Madame De sanscerre to deign to visst the most wretched Sinner, that ever called on heaven for mercy. — Tell her, I conjure her, by that God whom her virtue adores, to come and listen to the last words of the dying lau fanne 1”
Here the poor fellow burst into an agony of tears — I waa shocked — I was terrified — I Suffered myself to weep with him — I forgot my resentment towards the most cruel of husband’s. Madame De Sentville and the Comte De Solignac offered to accompany me to the Marquis, and I ordered my carriage to begot ready instantly.

When we arrived at the unfortunate Lau^ fanne’s, monsieur De Montville met me at the gate, and conducted me into an apartment adjoining that where the Marquis lay., heuold us that his friend was mortally wounded, that the comte’s ' Sword hud done Sure, though slow execution'. — that the Surgeons and physicians who had Seen him, agreed in pronouncing his recovery impoffibie; but they thought he might linger Some days. “He had Scarcely fallen, ” added monsieur De Montville, when he dcsired that I should be Sent for, which I confess Somewhat furprised me, hs we have not been friends a considerable time. Nothing, indeed, but his present Situation, could have prevailed on me to See him again, but at Such a season as this, resentment should give way to compassion.”
He had icarccly 'done speaking, when a Servant entered, and Said, that his lord would bs glad to see Flonfteur De ihdoniville. He left us in conse o.uence of this message, but returned Soon again ' with an entreaty, that I would accompany him to the marquis’s chamber, who asked every moment to See me. I gave Montville my hand, and he led me to the bed’s Side of the penitent lausanne. As I appeared, he exerted himself to rise, in order to offer me his thanks with more energy: but I prevailed on him to be composed, and assured him, that his life depended on his being So.
“Ah, Madam !” cried he in a faint voice, I wish not to exist — God can bear me witness that 1 do not. I am a wretch burdened, with iniquity, and onb fit to Sink into my grave. I have wronged the best — the most perfect of women — I have neglected my God — I have dwelled only on those destruuive pleasures which the most prt fligite qf women could offer — and I have at length niet with that fate which vice like mine deserves“
“
OF T II E R O C K. 171
My Lord, ” replied I; “your'repentance is everything — the God whom you bave offended, is 'uerciful as he is just. raise your heart to .him, and restefl on the merits of his death.”
“It can be to no purpose, ” cried he, “I am too great an offender to be forgiven! and he groaned in despair,
He was Silent for Some moments — at last he asked me, if I thought the Marohionefs 'would deign to viftt him once more 'whether foe 'would consent to come and pronounce to him her forgivenejs in his lad agony ( “Ah 1” added he, “if sbe would condescend to look at me again — if sbe would behold me immersed in the terrors of death, sbe would at least perceive, that heaven has avenged her Sorrows.”
I assured him, that the marchicness would fly to Paris on hearing that he wished to See her. I
O'
cheated him with the hope of receiving, from her own lips, his full and free pardon. He blessed me for the comfort I had given him, an d I lest him to take some'repose.
1 Sent off immediately an expressto Madame De lausanne, to inform her of the Situation of the Marquis. I told it in as delicate am .nner as pos sihle, and entreated her to make what haste fly could, in performing her journey. I remained all night with Madame De Sentville, at the marquis’s house, from whence I now write. He is ^ very ill, but entirely in his Senses. He dwells on hispastcrimes — they haunt him continually. He is afraid to call upon Ood for pardon, and his soul is, a chaos of horror and despair.
Madame Le Blanc, upon this duel slipped out of the house, amidst the confusion, and it is Said that file and the Chevalier D’elbeu, have left France together. What road they have taken is
H z not
IJZ T H E H E R M I T
not known, but proper officers of justice areia pur Suit of her. 1 hope sbe may be taken, and immured in a convent, appropriated for Such / abandoned creatures, for the rest of her days.
Madame La Bert came this morning to ask for the Marquis, and from a blunder of the Servants was sbewn into the apartment where I was writing. — I postessvd myself on the occasson, which sbe, poor wretch! did not do by any means. I inquired what her business was — and whom (he wanted She stammered — Sat down — drew out her handkerchief — I once more repeated my questions.,
“You can be no stranger to my errand. Madam, ” answered she“ “business is with the unfortunate Marquis.”
“Madam, cried I, the man whom you justly term unfortunate, is both unwilling and too ill to see you. — The hour approaches that is to Summon him before the awful tribunal of the most high. He has therefore little time to Spend, now, with the debauched Companions of his own Sex, or the profligate ones of mine. — He has a long 'account to settle with his God — and must do it Speedily.” ' *
I wish to see him but for five minutes!” resumed she.

“Do not, Madame La Bert, ” cried I, ** endeavour to ruin his soul for ever. Suffer him

THE Comte De Manille is much better, and pronounced, by his physician, to be out of danger. I am glad of it,, and hope itwill be a lesson to him for the future. He bears an amiable character, expresses much contrition at what has happened, and affures Solignac he was drawn into Le blanc’s Snares by the most powerful arts in the world, — Hers miserable, lest his antagonist should die by his hand, and declares he will yield.him felf to justice, as Soon as he is well enough to leave his apartment. A foolish intention which Solignac must dilfuadehim from. I will dispatch what I have written now, that you may be acquainted with this unexpected change in the ill-fated De Lausanne.

VICTORIA arrived yesterday — she is altered
surprisinglyi her charming eyes have a languor in them that alarms me greatly : sbe is grown thin, pale, and emaciated. Our joy at meeting, I will not attempt to describe, though I will own, sbe appeared not half So delighted at it, as I was. She tells me nothing affects her now — that she grows every moment more infcnstble, to the occurrences of life, every day more willing, to bid' adieu to the world. She nevermentions Luzy — but that her mind is absorbed in contemplation of what he was, is alas too certain !- — She lives only to bewail his loss, and to r emember his perfections.
As soon as the marchioness arrived, the house echoed with acclamations of joy, from the mouth of every domestic, and their lord’s danger was forgotten, in the pleasure they felt on their lady’s return. Lausanne had fallen into a Sweet steep, just before she came, and did not awake for Some hours after; when he did, he called for me, and asked, with a degree of impatience, if his wife was not yet come? I told him she was expedfed momently, for one of her attendants had been Sent on, to inform me, that she was not far from Paris. This intelligence visibly affected him — he was extremely fluttered — he laid he would rise to receive her — then lostng all/recollection of what he had uttered — he demanded y it was really true that

«
jbe had travelled sofar to see him P he called for Seraut to dress his hair, and, inquired whether he Should have time to go into the bath before her arri ' V alp he grew in short quite incoherent, and was Several minutes ere he came to himself— — that happened however, he begged to See Madame De Lausanne, as Soon as ever she came — and made me promise, that I would not let him steep in the meanwhile. I asked why he would not chuse to rest before he Saw her?
because, ” cried he, I am afraid of dying in my steep, or you would not perhaps awaken ' me time enough, ere the last struggle, to take the leave of her I wish to do.’*
I then told him, that I thought I heard a carri * ge drive into the court — that I would go and inquire whether it was Madame De lausanne’s, and hasten bach to inform him, 1 went out, and returned Soon after vvith an account of her arrival. He railed himself in his bed ^he clasped his hands - together, “Great God, ’* cried he with fervour, “how shall I behpld the face of injured innocence r
Fie pawfed Some minutes to recover of the agitations which Seemed to overwhelm him, and then
I ^ '
destred me to entreat her presence.
I retired to vidloria’s apartment, and found her there bathed in tears;. She gave me her hand, and I led her to the marquis’s chamber.
As Soon as she approached him, he exclaimed, ** Oh Madam, is it possible that you should deign ^ to vifitan inhuman monster like me? — Is it possible that you can ever, forget the cruel treatment, you have endured stnee first your father compelled you to bestow your hand on the undeserving lau fanjie? — ls it possible — — *^
“My
%
 77
** My Lord,"” interrupted the Marchioness, placing herself on the bed, “you never were unkind me, — Speak no more in this strain, but behold in me, an humble, an obedient wife, who comes to implore you to live for her fake.”
“Ah !” cried he, and with what strength he could, pressed her to his bosom, “Ah! my Vidloria, it is too late 1 — and I justly merit that death tny crimes so long have called for. — Yoil know not half my guilt — it makes — oh my gentle Sufferer! — it makes me, wretch as 1 am, tremble with horror at the bare refle8; ion.
“No more, no more, ” exclaimed Vifloria, and she railed his hand which she held to her
Ups.
“Yes, ” answered the Marquis, ** I must tell thee all — my soul will not depart in peace, until I make to thee a full confession, of the injuries you have Sustained from the miserable objebl before you — yes I will unfold the Secrets of my' heart, and show you all its Spots. — 1 will after that trust to your mercy to pity and forgive me.”
** When Luzy and I were together at college,., we had one day a difference about some boyish trifle, which is not worth the mention; his gene rous spirit, howevever, soon pardoned my Side of the offence, and begged me to forget what he was faulty in. I pretended to be cordially recon -- ciled on my part, and shared no assurances to convince him that I was so — yet this was merely a superficial appearance — I could not forgive so readily — shy heart cherished a bitterness tow; ards him — my soul shrunk with hatred at his reproach. T viewed him as the most hateful being of the whole., creation.
** We were much about the same age, and i our learning should have been pretty equal; but
H's I was
IS
1 was fenssbly chagrined to find, that his genius outloared mine — and that he was far advanced in every branch of literature; whilst I, who had began my studies Something before him, was infinitely behindhand with him in all he had learned.
A day was appointed on which we were both to declaim. As in a higher class he began before me, and his subject was philosophy— —
can never forget with what grace — with what eloquence he Spoke — his words Seemed ' chosen from the flowers of oratory — and his voice was more harmonious than any I had ever heard. His declamation was received with shouts of applause, and every one considered him as a youth of the highest abilities and most promising accomplishments.
; ** I began Soon after; my Subject was rhetoric — but, ah, how differently was it handled, from that which Luzy had just added beauties to, by his eloquence! — my audience yawned — hemmed — coughed — I felt myself unequal to the powers of oratory — but was at the same time too conscious
“of my rival’s merit. I descendcd from the rostrum with marks of composure, though my bosom contained the sharpest disappointment — and the most inveterate hatred to the young and sensible Comte. As Soon as I came down, I met him with almost extended arms to embrace me. ** My friend, ” cried he, “Suffer me to congratulate you upon the excellency of your discourse — you declaim well! — your voice is mellifluous, and your reasoning persuasrve.”
“I imagined he mearft this as an insult, and turned from him with an air of contempt. The priire wis immediately adjudged to be his — he re' ' it with humility, and the most graceful address. He astured Some of his intimate friends
that
%
O F T H E   179
that he was never more aliomfbed than when it was offered to for he had heard me with a degree
of admiration he could not express', and had hoped / should be rewarded suitably to my merit. He appeared much hurt lest a Snare of partiality rather than his ov/n eloquence had engaged the auditors to vote him the prize. Dihegarding the air of disdain I had shown him, he became ten thousai.d times more complaisant to me — and never did I ■ experience the least exultation from this amiable and accomplished youth. Notwithstanding I took an insurmountable aversion to him — and Swore within myself, to mortify him in every Scheme he could propose, and tocroishis dearest purpoics in life, if it could ever lie in my power to do so. — - ■
I will endeavour to be leis prolix in this relation — Suffice it to Say, his constant superiority over me in every thingthat was admirable, gave me many opportunities of testifying towards him my envy and. disgust — and when we left the seminary where we had been educated — I rejoiced in the prospect of. Seeing him less often.
“After he had made the tour of Europe, the world resounded with the beauties of his mind — the elegancy of his form and the charms of his address.
“I arrived myself in France about this time — •
I perceived my envy of him increase in proportion to the justness of his praises — it vas tumoured that the beautiful daughter of the dtikcde Clarence ' had engaged his love, and that after aslcing the ■ consent of his father (whom he honoured as a Son should do a parent;) he was to be united to lier ' in those indissoluble bands, .which were to Seal his happiness for ever. Stung with jeaiousy at these' ' I resolved that it riches and ambition,, ' Sway a father, the Duke De Clarenc^ should i never yield his daughter to the arms of Luzy;
■. and
\
io
and without knowing any more of her than what 1 had learned from report, I determined to marry her, were it only to give a stab to the felicity of the Comte.
“Elated with this Scheme, I got myself introduced to the Duke — I affe<fied to be enamoured of the blooming Victoria. I will own that I was much struck with your beauty — but had I not entertained a hope of mortifying my rival, nothing at that time could have persuaded me to marry., I need not add a great deal more — you know, alas I too well what follows. I threw out lures for the
/
duke’s ambition — I sbewed him the rent roll of
«
my possessions— — influenced his interested principles, and he consented to give up Luzy in favour of a richer man.
Ah, my Victoria! — when I reflect upon the tears you shed — upon the S: ghs it cost you to re ssgn your lover, I tremble at the idea of all the 'misery, my malicious enmity entailed upon your virtue. '
** As Soon as I was married, the end for which I had engaged you being obtained, your beauty could no longer attradi me. Since it was not from love I pofieffed it — dissipation — immorality ensu jed — and Madame La bert’s retiring to a convent, and there making you her confident, were planned in order to draw from you the Secret of your attachment to Luzy, and your hatred of your husband — you were, however, too virtuous to fushr any avowal of either to escape you to her; and sbevad almost dearly paid for it, by the loss of my'affection.
In her absence, I saw the infamous Le Blanc, and nothing but the fear of losing me entirely, could have made La Bert relinquish her diaboli cal intention of completing your ruin so soon. Finding that you were too prudent to difeover to
her
O F THE O C K. i
her your thoughts, she left the convent, and agreed to share with Le Blanc my love, and fortune. She knew your compassionate heart would Seek to give her comfort, whilst she avowed herself a penitent — there she was right — but had she Succeeded as well in prevailing on you to declare your Sentiments to her, your confinement in Italy,. would long since have taken place. Her behaviour at the masquerade where she appeared as a faiar was artful. 1 did not know of her being there — it was to see whether I should be an attendant of Le Blancas to that place, and her attacking me in the Severe manner that she did, was to blind you, if ever she should be discovered, and to make you fuppose, that she interested herself in your cause alone.
“Your amiable deportment towards me, made an impression on my heart — ajid I had very nearly given it up Solely to you — most indubitably would it have been So — but for the destructive blandish.. of these two women, who always hinted a fuspicion of your aversson to me, and at the same time pretended to give me the most convincing proofs of their attachment.
Madame La Bert, at length, wrought me up to a belief, that you had fufsered Luzy, in his journey through Paris, to See you, with all the hopes and warmth of a lover, and that you had consign i ed to him that honour, which you had ever Seemed to Set so high a value on in your sex. Inflamed with jealousy, the sight of his picture inyour possession, urged me to banish you from my sight. That picture, however, Madame De sanscerre has explained the story of — and I can never enough, repent the cruelty of my usage towards you.
“This, ” added the Marquis, taking hold of the snowy hand of his wife “is my confession. Forgive me — ah, forgive me I most amiable and
most
i82 T H E H E R M i t
most injured of women, or I can never die in peace !’V
He burst into a violent stood of anguish — and the bed shook under him from the force of hisaf flldfion. The amiable and unfortunate Vidioria said all that she could think of, to give him comfort — and after painting to him the Soft charms of religion, and bidding him trust in the mercies of the Almighty, she left him Somewhat composcd, and inclined to rest.
He has told her, that in the hands of Monsieur Le Gripinarde, her fortune of forty thousand pounds is lodged, and that it was So contrived by the Duke De Clarence her father, that the mar quis^could not touch a ssxpence of it, without having from her a gift of it, that he could never prevail on himself to make her any request relating to it, after the cruelties he had exercised on her — he wished that he had left the estate of Clarencd as much out of his power — but that, alas! was too late to repent of.

IT is now an hour, since the poor Marquis expired In agonies. After he recovered from the fit 1 mentioned, he wandei ed very much from reason, and did not postess his senses perfectly until about ten minutes before his death.
'When I left off writing to you, I repaired with Monsieur De Montville to his chamber — he was talking in a confused manner to Vidtoria.
“Ah !” exclaimed he, “Flell is open before me — I See it I — they are preparing to avenge the death of Luzy. — idispatched him like a coward — the law could take no cognizance of it. — La Bert recommended that way as Safest — I broke his heart — he.iought to fly from his enemy — - but then the
tempest roared -- -- the demons of hell were my
confederates
184
confederates — they made the thunder roll — the lightning flash — the ocean open. — Hark — hark!’* He jumped up in his bed — his attendants endeavoured to hold him down — and viistoria upon her knees besoiight him to be composed— — looked at her steadfastly — fly was the very inlage one would wish toreprefcnt of beauty in distress— — dishevilled hair — her hands clasped— — affrighted and tearful eye, rendered her the most interesting object I ever beheld. He, in fixed attention of her, Suffered his people to replace him in his bed — and after that he reached towards her his
hand.
“You are, ” cried he, ** the guardian angel of my llumbers. — Tell me — am I condemned for
all eternity.”
“God forbid!” answered our afflicted friend with fervour,
“God!” replied he, “God! — oh do not mention that name! — how much have 1 negle6ted my God !” — and then he reckoned upon his fingers,
and muttered to himself.
From the extreme agitation of his mind, his
wounds bled afresh, and in So much, that before they could receive any aid, he fainted through weakness. Upon his recovering a Second time, he talked sensibly— — strove to kifs VI gloria’s hand — she embraced him with affection— — begged her to pray for him, and we all kneele d around his bed, and audibly joined in offering up oraisons for a dying person; in the midst of which, he lifted up his eyes and hands to heaven, and with some Severe struggles yielded his soul to eternity.
I cannot express to you the amiable and charming Senfibihty of Victoria, She weeps for him — -
she laments his untimely end — butin her grief,
you
(
 85
you behold nothing of that false rhapsody, which modern times exhibit on such occasions, when a widow thinks it necessary to rend the air with her cries, at the departure of a man she could not love when living. The grief of the marebioness was much stronger— — much more poignant on the loss of a late beloved object— — my Maria! — <«■ has she not been unfortunate?

VICTORIA is at present with me. — She Intends to Set off for her retirement in Sardinia, which the Marquis has left her. That, and his house in Paris, were all the possessions he had remaining — both of which by his will, now belong to the Marchioness. The Marquis Le Lausanne has left no debts unpaid — he stripped himself of everything in order to behave with honour towards his creditors : in that particular he ever behaved well — and even Madame La Bert acknowledges, he owed her nothing — a qualm of conscience, it is supposed, gives rise to this declaration, having no doubt possessed herself of many more considerable Sums of his, than that which was imagined to be due to her from Lausanne— — fairly, God knows?

(” ^OME, my Vidloria — come to Belvoir castle, Ji and in the bosom of Sympathising friendship pour all thy Sorrows. — My mother’s Situation will not allow of my attending you at present to Sardinia — but if you will pafs three months with us ere you bid adieu to France. I promise to accompany you at the expiration of that time, to your beloved retirement. My dear parent joins with Lindor and myself, in entreating you not to refuse this request. — I know you love to confer happiness — if mine then was ever dear to you, let me experience it by your ready acquiescence to my wishes.
You will be pleased to See our pretty Sophy grown a thousand times more charming than when you were struck with her — and her brother improved in that learning your charity has given him an opportunity of applying to. — I would keep the Secret of their father’s return from you until you could be informed of it from their own grateful hearts — but that I know it will afford you pleasure to hear it as Soon as postible.
He came home to his humble cottage Some time last week, after having met with a thousand misfortunes to detain him from his family — the principal one was, his having consented to go on board a vefsel bound for St. Lucie, merely to observe the mecbanifin of a ship, and meaning to return on shore as Soon as his curiostty was indulged; mark the consequence. A storm arose, and'

continued all night So terribly, that he could not land, but was driven out of port in the velfel. The next morning the captain perceived that he was a goood way from France, as everything was entirely prepared for his voyage, and he only waited for a fair wind, instead ot returning to put the poor man on shore, he continued his course to the West-indies, in spite of the tears and agony he beheld him immersed ip. When he arrived at St. Lucie, the climate, and the fedendtary life he had led inhis voyage to it, broughtjonhim a thousand diseafes which confined him for many months. In short after a tedious fojournment in a strange land,, a humane gentleman who heard his story, consented to bring hihi with him to France, and he, arrived not above a fortnight ago at Bordeaux.
So far have I found it not difficult to relate: — r but were I to attempt the joy with which his family is inspired, I should find ray pen inadequate to the talk.
I have written to beg Sanfcerre to interest herself in my behalf — and to persuade you to favour us with your company at Belvoir castle. — If you do not come — I shall fancy myself less dear to you — an idea that I should find too difficult to Support.

I AM arrived at Madame De nilleneups, my dear Sanfcerre, and have been received with all that tendernefsj which is So peculiarly adapted to hearts like her’s, maria’s, and lindor’s. Our meeting was very pathetic — was very affe6fing — the reverend form of my friend’s mother, reminded rhe of my own, when she embraced her Victoria, after having unwillingly consented to her leaving Clarence with her husband. — Ah, can I ever forget her tears and ssghs in that moment? — can I ever forget, with what a wildness of Sorrow she strained me to her heart? — oh my san feerre I feel it! — at this instant I feel that embrace. — What an idea! — alas I I perceive I have not yet conquered sensibility. The Comte De Savillon and his admirable wife, t are emblems of conjugal fidelity and love. He haslost nothing of that anxious, yet delicate attention towards her which was So amiable in him before the knot that Secured her his was tied; and on her part, she is the same bewitching sensible and tender mistress which the days of courtship Saw her. When you, my dear Julia, and Solignac are married, I shall have nothing more in this life to wish for.
Adieu. I am not now an entertaining correspondent — I am confeious that lam not — you must not therefore think me unkind, if I do not
write again, before I arrive at the castle Au Bois.

sincfiyou left Paris I have had Some trouble with Madame La Bert — she has taken another religious turn — she has wearied me, with letters containing the words Pardon — Convent jdaetch — Penitencef idc. idc. idc. She execrates her perfidy towards you — she exclaims against her own immoralities — she confesses, having been in league against you with the Duke De Maurice — in short, she accuses herself without mercy. I writ her an answer which I begged might Serve for ail the letters she had ever taken the trouble to Send me, and those, that she may perhaps address to me in future. Setting forth my iorrow for her crimes, and my joy at her penitence — my Sorrow, 'if she should be hypocritical — and my joy, should she really be Sincere. 1 then took the liberty of recommending to her, a house of poor Clares at Gravelines, where I hinted, she might fast and pray and work, almost in proportion, with those

monstrous iniquities, she had' made So entire a confestion of to me. I then wished her perfeve rcnoe in her undertaking, and hoped to be remembered in her pious prayers.

Le Blanc has not been taken — a circumstance you arc not lorry for, I dare Say — her Paramour has never returned to France.
I Saw the Duke De Maurice yesterday — he toolc my hand and Sighed upon it. “Your fair friend. Madam — how does the too charming marchi oness?”
I will not tell you what he said after — you would be angry — yet a man of his constancy, must not be too readily blamed for rejoicing at the disappearance of one obstacle to his happiness. — He had the assurance, my dear Vidtoria, to say, he would hope to call you one day his. I aniwered with an air of disdain, and an emphatically pronounced “Never.’^ tie shrugged his shoulders— — and turned from me.
Poor Solignac frets at my obstinacy, as he terms it, in not conienting to marry him, before my affairs are Settled — a thing I am positively determined on. Since I am not to be outdone in ge rierofity. Farewell — these six weeks of your absence from me, have appeared So many months — and yet you talk of Secluding yourself for ever, in that odious castle! — Let pity for your friends couoteradl io frightful an intention.

YOU look upon my Situation as deplorable, my dear Maria, and from your extreme ast section form, believe that it cannot but be prejudicial to my health, merely from my giving way to melancholy; but that melancholy. So far from being injurious to me, is the only consolation I enjoy. To remove those fears, hovvever, which you feel for your unhappy friend, in consequehce, of your tender affeistion for her, I can tell you that I met with an incident lately, which, for a short time prevented me from giving any attention to my own Sorrows, though it is not in the power of any human event to make me cease to lament the loss of my ever beloved, and never to be forgotten Luzy. — After the hurry, indeed, which this incident occasioned, was over, I was the more strongly reminded of my unhappy fate.

■ A few days ago we had here So violent a storm of thunder, lightning, and rain, accompanied with a whirlwind which hlled every breast with terror, : every bosom but mine, to that you know distress is familiar: I was therefore less fensible of the danger; or rather less anxious of preserving a life which has for Sometime been almost ready tostr^ under the weight of accumulated wretchedness. Yet, though I am indifferent about my own safety, Maria, I could not behold from the windows of tlse castle, a vessel which had long struggled to ride thro’ the storm, compelled at last to submit to its overpowering violence, and bulged upon the rock, from, which those on board had incffecludly endeavoured to steer it. The Screams of the miserable crew, reaching my ears, filled my soul with horrors. I felt lor the unfortunate victims;; • felt also for mysdf; terrified, at the idea that the merciless waves had Swallowed up the beloved of my heart, my grief was renewed, and I wept aloud. — My people now came to tell me, that the greatest part of the crew was drowned. — me thought I saw my Luzy finking a second time in the fathomless ocean. — They imagined that my tears flowed ior themy but they proceeded from an additional cause, ever to be remembered with the most painful fenlations. — While I was giving a vent to the effusions of my sb/fifibility, Nannette, my faithful Nannette, came running into my apartment— — madam!” exclaimed fly, almost breathless, Whatafeene ol distress have I beheld? In that velsel you see broken to pieces by the storm, was a family who are all drowned, except one lady, whom the sailors had lashed to a part of the ship : but the wind bursting the cords asunder, she was driven by it to the shore.

ftake up my pen again, Maria, to continue my narration. I was before too much affected to proceed.
My people, at my desire, brought the lady they had Saved, though with great difficulty, to the castle. — She now wept, now raved, and called aloud upon her Meilcour: vowing, that as he was for ever lost, sbe would follow him, and partake of his watery grave; struggling, aiso, as piuch as sbe could, from the failure of her strength, • with those who held her, and begging to be re leased that sbe might join her lover, her husband.:,

She, at length. Submitted to the being led to the apartment I had destined for her. — She then addressed me in the following pathetic manner. ** Your Sympathising tears. Madam, have done more than the rhost earnest persuaflons could have effected : you feel, you cherish my Sorrows; others insult them by desiring me no longer to complain— — “longer to complain coritinued she, lifting up her eyes, while her hands were clasped in an agony of despair — Not to lament, when I have lost all I held dear on earth? — Oh, Madam I you do not — cannot know — what a wretch you now behold — I would Speak — I wish to tell you — but my voice fails me — I cannot ar. tfeuiate my woes.” ^ — Here she sunk into a kind of fainting fit, and was conveyed toa bed near which I Seated myself. While I was assisted by nan nette, applying lavender water to her temples, and volatiles to her nose, I had an opportunity of taking a view of her person— — found her young,
• lovely, and even delicate beyond expression, though the Splashing of the Sea, and the disorder of her dress had deprived her of those advantages wstiich give graces to the finest figures. When she opened her eyes, and attempted to thank me for my care of her, there was an expreshon in chenif and a melody in her plaintive accents, which filled me with admiration, and made me feel a double share of compassion for her fate, I endeavoured to persuade her to take Some refreshment; but all my eloquence could not for a long time prevail, - — ** No, ” -? — cried she, with a sigh, which fe«med to rend her heart — ** No, madam,

YOU will feel how I Sympathised with this poor Sufferer, Maria; I not only kept pace with her ssghs and tears, but told her that She was, by no means, the only wretched of her Sex : adding, that I had, myself, met with a dreadful calamity of the Same kind, by losing the man whom I had all the reason in the world, to love, honour, and revere. — Here she started up,. — *
• looked earnestly in my face, and, pressing my hand with an inexpreltible agitation, cried eagerly, “But you did'not see him die — you did not See him float on the waves till he expired before your eyes — Oh I that — that was too much to bear How was my heart rent by Such pathetic expressions! They prevented me from offering her any immediate consolation. I could only reply,, in broken accents, Yes — but I was the cause of
his death.” — Ah!” replied she, with a mournful, compassionate air, ** that was killing indeed. — Yet you live, my dear madam : you have been gracioussy Spared to offer comfort to Such a wretch as me.” — ** I haves answered I, collediing my* self, in consequence of this Speech, (my heart Sunk within me, and I reproached myself for having been guilty of ingratitude to the Giver of All,) ** 1 have endeavoured to be resigned to the Father of Mercy, but I cannot bring myself to the frame of mind I wish to be in.

My poor unhappy guest, Maria, at length
overcome with affiioiion and fatigue, con lenied to try to repose herself— — then left the room, ordering Nannette to watch by her, and went out to breathe a little fresh air, in hopes that it would relieve my full heart, from which I strove to banish the unfortunate Luzy. — I thought, indeed, I had Somewhat less reason to complain, by having found that I was not the only, woman in distress : • I thought too, I might reckon myself less miserable than this mourning stranger, having still friends remaining who were most dear to me; particularly you and my sanscerre, who Supplied the prlace of father, mother, ci thought too, that as my good Nannette, though in an humble station, was a treasure, it vas my duty to be

greatest comforts, as we can before them freely unbosom ourselves, and by venting our Sorrows frequently find the greatest relief: we are afraid to wound the heart of a near relation, or a valued friend by our complaihts: there is also feme kind 6f restriction before the dearest companions of our days, who are either our Superiors or equals; but with domestics, there is no Such delicacy required : we pay no regard to their pfesence; we give a vent to our Sorrows, as if we believed cur felves unheard. — When Such humble friends as fny Nannette, pay us that attention which we Sometimes require, we receive it with the greater jatisfaction, as we can receive it without con uraint; and are even at liberty to return a peevish, discontented answer to their offered consolations, without caring whether we please or offend. —

On a sudden, casting my eyes on the beech, and beholding the foaming fear Sighed aloud, and alked, if the rolling vraves would recall my Luzy. — I walked, hastily, to and fro, quite absorbed in these contemplations for sometime. — One of my Servants then came running towards me, telling me that they had taken up a man, who by his deaths appeared to be of some fashion, and that they had hopes of recalling him to life. — I started at this intelligence — my tend, foolish heart dc.. me — from the Similitude of circumstances— — I forgot that my Luzy had been long, long dead; that his precious remains had been long food for fish, and that had his body been difeovered, and taken up, it would have been so changed as farcely to have been known. — I then, recoliedling my wandering thoughts, inquired what sort of a peifon this stranger was. — Ialked, whom they had been so fortunate as to Save. — The answer was,

1 am always pleased while I am conversjig with my Savillon; in that light do I confider the letters which pass between us. — To proceed then — I hastened to Madcmoifelle de Narbonne; (for that is her name, as 1 was informed, by Some wha esi^: aped the wreck) she had been asteep, for a moment — she started, as from a terryfying dream at first, she appeared all confused. — V Where ami?” Said she, wildly — Where am I, meil cour?

Suddenly recoliedfing herself — she added — ** No — no. — he is dead — I Saw him die — and; in the most dreadful manner.” — ‘‘you might think So, ” ^ an swered I, and yet you may have been mistaken.. — There is a man who pretends to havedeen him alive.” — Oh! where is he? — who is he exclaimed she with great eagerness— — an agony of expectation — yet apparently doubtful of the
truth

truth of what I had Said. — Is it possible, my dear madam r — Let me See him myself ” — continued sbe, rajsing herself up — “Let me fly to him — I can revive him Sooner than any one : my mcif cour would hear the voice of his Adelaide, thou^^h

k o
difficulty that I could keep her from running out ol the room. — At last, however, I prevailed On her to be more calm, telling her that I was Sure he would come to her. -- ^^* Aye, ” Said she, So he would, were he able. — I have no doubt of that. He would fly through every danger to meet me - — I cannot bear this fuspense — ’tis wojfe, far worse than death : let me go — let me go — I will believe in the goodncss of the Almighty — I will hope my love is alive.” — With these words, Springing from me — for I had hold of her hand — she darted towards the door, to meet her meil cour, as she hoped. — There she was stopped by a messenger who same to tell us, that the person whom they thought was Mr. Meilcour Was the captain of the vessel, and that the body of the former could not be found. — This intelligence Was too hastily delivered for the poor Adelaide. — She instantly dropped, senselefs, on the floor. — • You may imagine, Maria, how much I reproached myself with having assisted in cruelly deceiving her. — But I must bid you adieu for the present.

YOU say that you interest yourself greatly in the history of the unfortunate Adelaide, and entreat me to continue it. — Ah! Maria !' is not your Victoria as unfortunate — more unfortunate, ten thousand times!” — We raised mademoisdle de Narbonne from the floor, but we could not for a .long time bring her to life: and when we Succeeded, she Seemed to have quite lost her reason. She raved, rent her deaths, and tore lier hair, called upon her lover, and asked why he had left her — why he had left her twice — why one jiroke was not sufficient to kill her? — And, indeed, we could hardly — both of us — Support the load of aifllidion with which we were oppressed. As for myself, I was utterly incapable of making any attempt to aflford my poor Adelaide the Smallest relief, I thought, too much, how 1 should have felt, had I been tantalised with the hopes of feeing my Luzy again; and if those hopes had been all blasted — Oh! my Savillon, what anguish is there in that, idea!

The person whom I mentioned in ray last, was the captain of the vessel which had been wrecked. « — I found him, on his being recovered from, the ex extreme fatigue he had undergone, an agreeable intelligent man. — After having thanked me for the relief and entertainment he bad received at the castle, he added, “I understand.

We could not think of any better method than that of lashing her to a piece of the timbers: this method he approved of, hoping she might stoat on it to shore : this motion, however,, she very strenuousty opposed, declaring that no ihing but death should Separate her from her

She consented to adt agreeable to his desire, but said she would first take leave of him, as she retihy believed she should not’ live through the storm: adding, that she did not wish to live through it, without being assured of bis Safety; being determined never to be left behind alive. — In vain did Meilcour urge that it was our duty to do everything incur power to preserve the existence which was given us as a bles fing, and that no change of fortune should ever make us throw it carelessly away— — this time he assisted in fastening her to the raft, though the lea ran So high that it was with the greatest difficulty we could, any of us, compass our designs, and fears for her lover, which produced the most pathetic lamentations, retarded us considerably in the execution of them. At last, however, wc. finished our operations; we lashed her to the rash — Just as wb were going to launch her on the tumultuous waves, and wdien Meilcour was prer paring to follow her, and to endeavour to swim to shore, she caught fast hold of him, "and conr jured him, by the love which he had always pro fested for her, never to abandon her — never to die without plunging her along with him into the bottornlefs deep. — “Let us go together’^ — ex. daimed she — (in heart piercing accents) let us gp together — no matter where we go — if we cannot live united, let us die So — I am not afraid to die

with youf Meilcour — I should be grieved to leave you — — ytx if we muji part — if we muji — Oh!! t cious heaven! let me be Singled out by death 1 let ' me not have the'misery of Surviving all that I i hold most dear in this world !” — He strove to encourage her \ he strove to Support himfelfhy her fide, and they had Some reason to hope that they might, both of them, reach the point they had, ' most anxiousty, in view: but their hopes were blasted. — At the very moment Meilcour was with.. a few firokes of the shore, a large wave rolled over him, and utterly deprived him of the power of struggling with his fate; it deprived him of his breath — and he was doomed to die. We Saw the danger he was in, but we could not get near enough to him to be of the least Service. — Adelaide also saw the danger to which her lover was exposed;; heard a loud Scream, and imagined that it was her last, for we heard no more. We still, however, perceived her, for Some time time floating on the waves, which over powered us all, and prevented us, indeed, from being able to give each other any astistance. — Yet, luckily, as I happened to be a better Swimmer than Meilcour,
I at last gained the land, but I was So Spent that I 'wonder how 1 could have Supported myself So long. — Meilcour gave me his pocketbook before he threw himself into the Sea, which I preserved in my jacket, as I could Swim very well in my clothes, and I beg you will give it to Mademoiselle de Narbonne, accepting, yourself, my repeated acknowledgments for the care v.sbich your people have taken of me.”
Here the captain finished his narrative, which affected me exceedingly, as it brought to my mind the death of my dear Luxy, who perished just in the same manner as this Meilcour did. — Oh! my

SHE is gone — my dear Maria; the poor Suffering Adelaide is no more — She could not Survive the shock she had Sustained by the loss of her Meilcour. — Oh! how could 1 Survive the loss of niy Luzy? — : And yet I am alive; I live, and am in tolerable health, after an event which, as you might have imagined, would have inevitably destroyed me.

When I returned to the wretched Adelaide, after the conversation with the captain, mentioned
m
^12
in my last letter, I found her just recovered from aswoon; just brought to herielf by the strength of.the cordials which had been administered to her : — but as. Soon as’ (he opened her eyes, sbe elofcd them again, declaring, sbe would not live; and alkccl ihose who were busy about her, why. they had restored hi s to life? As the preservation of her exiit' : e was only the continuance of her misrry. —!. iain did they urge the crime of sui cid ^., which was actually committed, they Said; by aii persons who persisted in not taking care of the life which thc\x Maker had best'ov/ed on them' as a blesting. — -‘‘ Ido acknowledge, ” replied sbe,. ** that wlstle Meilcour was mine, life was indeed,, a Blesting, most invaluable — and though I sincerely wish, though I fervently pray to die'’' — added sbe, with a stgh, from the bottom of her heart — I am too fensible of the daring crime of. felstdestrudiion to be guilty of it destgncdly : but God,, who is all raercifust in the midst of bis wrath, and who does* not require more from his weak creatures than they are able to perform — God, will, I trust, in pity to the Sufferings I have endured, hasten to release me. L am going,, L hope— — believe — to join my Meilcour.” '
Here sbe made a long pause— —
■ putting her cold, feeble, dying hand inmine, sbe added — ** Farewell, my dear madam:, — may you be amply rewarded for all the kindness. which you have sbewn to a poor, distressed, unfortunate woman. — May you — Oh !' may you' never feel what Jhe has Suffered !”
She then laid her face composedly on her pillow, and uttered not another fyliable. She even went off without a groan. — Oh I that my last Sigh may be like hers! — Why — why have I not followed my Luzy } I should then be at peace,, like, the poor Adelaide, whose last fentimentj

cannot. Surely, be deemed blameable. She wished not to live; but at the Same time, she was not afraid to die: life had no charms for her, when she was robbed of the partner of her heart, robbed of the man whom she loved at once from duty and inclination : — Yet you see she took, no steps to put a period to her existence. — She Suffered with patience, and she was — happily, I may add — reflesting'on. her most painful Situation — released.
I looked at her, just now, laid out upon her bed: looked at her with a kind of melancholy. Satisfaction, which I am not able to describe. — corrected myself, however, with this question —
“Is she not at peace? — Oh I my Maria! would to heaven, I could say that my Sorrows were at an end I But this unhappy event revives them. — Yet I will be resigned— — will not murmur— — as my lot is, I will not complain — 'I will Submit. — Is not fubmtffion, is not ressgnation right my Savillon?

HOW much have I felt for you, my dear
visoria! how exceedingly do I pity you! Surely, nothing could have been more unlucky than the wreck you have So pathetically described just at a time when you must have been deeply affected by it. — Yet still, if you give yourself leave to reflect a little, my Vibboria, you will certainly allow that you cannot be so miserable now, as you was while you lived with a man whom you had so much reason to distike from his unkind treatment; and though you may lament the loss of the amiable luz y, can you derive no consola tion from your being at liberty to lament his lot's: From your being your own mistress? From your having it in your power to Say and do what you please, without having an ill natured, tyrannical husband tocontradidi and control you? Nor to reproach you for the sighs you vent, for the tears you shed, mourning for the fate of him who was the man of your choice? During the life of M. De lausanne, you could not without a degree of criminality Speak to — or think of — your Luzy : though it were almost impoltible for you to forbear thinking of him, and Speaking to him. What a relief, therefore, to your over charged heart was the death of this husband, forced upon you by the defpotism of a father, who estimated all men by the riches which they poffelted, and who paid no regard — flinty hearted himself — to the finer feelings of the Soul. consider, also, my Vidloria,
that unjust and unkind as this father was, you
obeyed
O F T H E   i;
obeye d him, and gave up love for duty: you have, consequently, no reason to upbraid yourself with regard to your Luzy; whose loss you juilly lament, but you ought not to fuppose yourself the cause of his being dead— — you. By having acted the part of a dutiful child, you will be I greatly commended by thousands for your pruden j tial behaviour. You had not the most distant I idea of injuring Luzy by your obedience to your parents: you only gave him a more exalted proof of your merit; for, admitting that you had been obstinate, and refused lausanne, you never could have, married Luzy, but in. a clandestine manner; and would you have deserved his love by so un dutiful a proceeding? What opinion, must a man, do )’'ou.imagine, have of the woman, who on his account, disobeys her parents, and flies from her family with him f Can Such a woman be, rationally expected to be faithful? Will a had daughter ever make a good wife Can a man depend upon her who has discovered that she is capable of deceit? Believe me, my dear marchioness, you would never have been happy with Luzy without the consent of the Duke of Clarence, and as that consent could not be obtained, you should be ^ Satisfied with having obliged your father, though against your own inclination. On that account, the Sacrifice which you made, did you the greater honour. We are told, my dear vi£loria, that there is no merit in the performance of what really gives us pleasure: we are told that virtue arises from felf denial. These do61rines have, I allow, a Severe appearance, and you will’probably, tell me, in return, that I should not have found obedience so very easy, if my choice had been like yours, opposed : and that, as my excellent mother was as fond of Lindor, as I was myself, everything went on fmqothly. Drawing this conclusion.

2i6 T n E BE R M I T
'clusson from these premises, that I cannot forra any judgement of the affli£tions which you have endured, which you jhll endure. — All this, I grant is true, in some degree; and yet J have felt, and do feel for you, my dearest friend : and it is my Feeling so accutely for your distress which makes • me avail myself of every argument in my power, to render you more Satisfied with your own fitua tiou, even with' the loss of Euzy though we have not indeed received any certain intelligence of hissbeing dead, lam afraid to flatter myself or youi with his being alive. however, were I Sure that he no longer existed, I cannot think that you were the cause of his death : if he was really lost at sea it was an accident; it might have happened to him had you never married De lausanne : and Supposing that in consequence of that marriage, he had either destroyed himself, or thrown himself spurpofely in the way of danger, what a want of fortitude must he have discovered! How unworthy of being the husband of my Vi; oria, must that man appear who cannot Support a disap 'pointment.without flying in the face of his Creator! Surely, my amiable friend, herself must defpise Such a character: no longer, then, give way to an unavailing Sorrow, but rather be thankful, that if heaven decreed luzy’s life should not sbe preserved, you were not united to him. — Your Separation, in that cafe, would have been infinitely more painful. Reflect on what I have written, but do not reflection it in the melancholy retirement you aret come away directly to your Maria, and in her bosom bury your grief. My mother, my Savillon, both entreat you to listen to my persuasions; they both insist upon your compliance. — While you were with me, you was less afflicted— — may remember — as I
did not fustier you to indulge yourself with foutu
do,

.Return, therefore, to your friends my Vifforia, to those friends who wish most earnestly to drive away all Sorrow, all fadrress from your mind, and to make you as cheerful, as happy as themselves: but if you cannot bring yourself to make Such an addition to our felicity, be persuad ed, at least, to go to Paris, to go anywhere,
. rather than stay in a place which So continually forces you to recolledi your loss. At Paris, you may amuse yourself with your Julia, and her difficulties, as they are not of a Sufficient magnitude to be lamented, may employ your thoughts, and not only steel you from your attention to your own troubles, but put you in a way to assist her in the removal of those with which she is oppressed: you may also, at the same time, Serve our common friend sougnac, who may be, perhaps,, without our friendly interposition, not a little injured by her capriciousness. She loves him, I believe, yet I believe too that she will put his patience to a Severe trial, — Our S; inlcerre is certainly amiable, but is she not determined to make use of the power she has, evidently, over this poor man, in too despotic a style? Solignac, undoubtedly, loves her too much for his own repose. I dohot approve of trifling with a lover in this manner: a man whom we have encouraged. To let you See that Such a mode of behaviour may be attended with disagreeable consequences, I will tell you a little incident which happened near us a few days ago. The Baron de Chamois had after a tedious courtship, gained the promise of the Countess de Vignolles, a young widow, who was highly deserving of his admiration, but had been left by the Count in very indifferent circumstances, occasioned by his extra'^mgance: yet neither the vol. HI. K ardent

/
ardent pafsion of Chamois, nor his considerable fortune, could prevent her endeavouring to exert all the power which, sbe believed, file had over him, nor hinder her from making him feel her caprice. She even took a pleasure in feeing him miserable on her account, and in laughing at his complaints. For a while, he bore this treatment with uncommon patience; his patience, however, was at length quite exhausted. — Meeting with young ma demoifeile de Murci at a rural ball, he tookit into his head' to try if he could, by making his first mistress jealous of Angelica, hasten her to reward his love. But his experiment had an effect just ©pposite to that which he intended. Madame de. Vignoiles, instead of endeavouring to recall him by a condescending carriage, played the so Ciiuch to the life, that monsieur Le Baron imagined that sbe never could have felt the stightest esteem for him; and that sbe had, indeed, a particular avcrsion to him. Mademoiselle de Murci, finding it both her interest and inclination to be kind to her new admirer, took him at his word, In short, they were married in a hurry, and our widow is So much chagrined by her folly, and discomposed at her having lost So desirable an establishment, that sbe is fallen sick, in consequence of her lover’s desertion: and she may, perhaps, pay dear for her disappointment, by its proving injurious to her health. Communicate this little anecdote to our sanscerre, my dear Vidloria, by way of caution; it may do her good, and give a new turn to your ideas; you must not dwell any longer upon what cannot be remedied by all the ' thinking the world— — to me, my lausanne;; the efforts I have made with my pen to amuse you prove efficacious, and produce ' ' ' the

YOU are very kind, my considerate Maria, to endeavour to Soothe the Sorrows of a heart which is for ever robbed of its peace. I am very willing to allow that what you say is just and proper; butl.am afraid I am too wayward to derive benefit from your arguments or your persuasions.
Shad, I must confess, fet my heart — perhaps, too fondly, upon Luzy; and can you blame me for my partiality in his favour? You, who are no stranger to his personal charms? — Yet all lovely as he was in his person, that alone would not have so firmly attached me to him.

ly than his outward' form: and then the delicacy of his manners — his manners, Maria, were to the last degree (educing. Yet you would have me think no more of this attradtive, this amiable man! you would have me entirely forget him, — and — if I will not return io you would have me reside at Paris; that place of noise, tumult, and impertinence, wiiere I have already endured So much unhappiness. No : it must not be — •! cannot think of making myself still more unhappy, by a public exhibition of my Sorrow; it is Severe enough, I want no addition to its poignancy. No — 1 cannot bear the thoughts of fucli a proceeding — I will live and die in Solitude. As I cannot recall my Luzy, let me, at least, feel the Satisfaction of lamenting his loss, which I cannot do in a crowd. With regard to our sanscerre, I am Sorry if (he indulges her capricious temper at the ex pence of solignac’s peace; but I can by no means think of going io dier in hopes of reclaiming her, or of returning to you : my whole soul is, at present, too fulbof the .idea of my luz y, to permit me to quit a retreat where I am at liberty to nourish those Sentiments which, however abiurd they may Seem to thole who are happily not in my ft -- tuation, are the only consqlations which I am capable of receiving; and So much relief do they give to my disturbed mind, that I am not Sure whether they will not contribute to the preservaticn df my life; alife which, I could, not, on any other tei ms, make an objet of my attention. However, by remaining here Lean give the rein to a thousand wild, ’ romantic fancies, which, thciigh they may ^ appear ridiculous to others, afford ease to my over whelmed heart, and render my painful Situation less insupportable; imagining, that in this part of the deep my treafiire — my richest treasure was sunk, I can suppose that I behold the very
Spot

Spot where my drowned lover lies : my piercing eyes reach him in his watery grave. I call aloud on him, .as if 1 believed that he heard me. — You think now,., my Maria, .that I give an extravagant indulgence to my melancholy: you imagine, no doubt, that I injure my constitution by it — but I am of a different opinion : it Sooths, it Softens my mind; it gives me the only pleasure I am capable of.receiving. You iay that I have done my, duty : Lagree with youa — but if my adherence to that duty — however justifiable — has destroyed - the. most amiable of his Sex, should I not be unworthy of the love which he felt — generousty felt for me, if I did not lament him to my latest breath? Oh! Maria — Maria — thank.heaven! you never felt what feel— — you ever be preserved from such a trial! you cannot feel what I have endured : you met with no impediments to your happy union with the man you loved. — Your exemplary mother had the highest esteem for him; you was, consequently, blessed beyond expression, in having her free approbation to Sanctify the choice of your heart. It is impossible, therefore, for you to form an adequate idea of Sufferings. Let me, then, my dear Savillon, let me Seek, unmolested, the only comfort 1 am able to receive, that is, the retreat from a world which cannot afford me the least pleasure; which, in fadi, only gives me pain : — By appearing tn that world in a disagreea ble light, I sbail certainly disgust those with whom I associate; on the other hand, while I am in this peaceful retirement, I am interrupted, only by my own Sorrows, which were, indeed, greatly in creased by ' the late melancholy wreck. And though the dangers and distreffes of that unhappy couple brought the loss of my ever to be remembered Luzy more keenly to my mind; I will be; more rational, more resigned. — I bend, most hum

bly, to the will of the Most High; I Submit without murmuring, without repining to his all wise decrees. — Yet, 1 see, I feel, I confess my failings,
I must still lament my loss. The pity that involuntarily flows from me when I remember the fate of luz.y, is surely a virtuous sensation. In hopes, ' therefore, that my Maria will no longer wish to remove me — at least, not atpresent — from a place which yields me the only consolation I can taste,
I bid her adieu, adding my best respefis to Madame de Villeneuf and our Lindor, and entreat her

I AM arrived at the Castle Au Bois, my dear sanscerre, after a long stay of five months with our admirable friends atbelvoir. — My excellent Maria accompanied me hither last week, but as Madame de villeneups ill health will not permit her making me happy by a long vistt, sbe will be obliged to leave me, in a fortnight at farthest. Lindor, who was our escorte, pretends to view this charming place as a horrid seclusion from the world — but I, who think differently from him, in respedb to that world he boasts of, may also be supposed to differ with him as to the Situation of this stlent retreat. He aid Maria have made a visit to nannette’s mother, and the Comte has taken such a fancy to her brother,., from the good character he bears, that he has insisted unon his going to France with him, where he will settle him in a comfortable farm, and, give him enough to begin the world with handsomely, — If his mother and Sister choose to ?o to him aster he is fixed in his new habitation, Lindor will send for them, and defray their expenses thither. — Nannette,, however, begs leave to remain with me for ever, X unless her mother should require her Services. Excellent Nannette — never can I forget thy tender,,, and fidelity I
We have walked on the Seacoast — we have listened to the dreadful waves, that lash the Sounding shore — we have beheld that terrible ocean, which (wallowed up the treasure of my fond heart. Lindor was affected— — stole her handker

chief to her eyes — i vas the only one that remained unmoved. I curbed my Sighs — I withheld ihofe bursts of grief, which would have escaped me had I been alone. — I pretended to have my ^ thoughts at Paris — I talked of it — I Spoke of the lively pleasure that attended our Sanfcerre — I cheated their penetration — for had they Seen roe weep— — would have endeavoured to periuade me to leave this solitude— — alas Such Scenes as these are all that can give me comfort now! When Maria is at a distance, I will not Scfyiple to tell her my thoughts as they arise — then when I reason, she will not suffer a Selfish wish for my presence to urge a motive for my quitting a place that yields me delight. — She will permit what I write to Sink deep into her heart — and she will, in idea, judge what Jhe should do, in Such a Situation. ' — Here it is far different — the Solemnity of the Scene, together with my tears and sighs, would banish every notion of comfort’s being found alone — and without listening to my arguments, she would give me a thousand reasons, why I should rejoin her ip the world. — Ah, I can never think ot doing So without horror!
Maria came into the room as I ended the above Sentence — She is raiserable about leaving me in this dreary pace as Lindor will have it called. — I have endeavoured to convince her, that it is better for my own peace, that I should remain here — and I have given her a Solemn promise of leaving Sardinia, should I ever be able to think of Society with less reluslance. This assurance has, in Some measure, satisfied her — and indeed it could cost me very little to give it, since I am persuaded, that nothing which now exists has charms Sufficient to allure me from retirement.

in my solitary walks, I have found out a delightful retreat upon the Seashore. There is a vast' rock, at the foot of which 1 sit — whilst its lop which juts over considerably— — a canopy for my head. — Here I contemplate that cruel ocean which robbed me of what I held most dear, and listen to the murmuring of/the waves which roll beneath my feet — It is about a little mile from the castle, and at the back of this rock a thick wood adds a gloom to the natural awfulness of its Situation. 1 strolled there last night, and Seated myself at the bottom  as usual, with my face towards the sea. The moon shone uncommonly bright, and reflected a thousand beauties on the calm and unruffled waves. I was inspired with a melancholy which at once took posteffion of my
bosom.

** Ah!” cried I audibly, “Ah! inhuman element! perfidious — dangerous ocean! — how many bitter moments hast thou cost me! how many bitter tears have I shed by thy cruelty! Perhaps this wave that dares to intrude So no near me — was the very one, that bore Luzy from my sight for ever! — “Oh my g.pd — my God !” and I clasped my hands in anguish, “behold my wretchedness — behold my agony !t — shrill I never again See him ?- — shall I never moire lobk on that beloved object?? — — never, never — it is impolfible !” — ihere I paused for a few moments. — I cried — I sobbed — I bathed my bosom with my tears. “Ah, ” added I, “he is dead! — Luzy, Luzy, it was I that killed thee — it was by my infidelity you were lost 1” The weakness of my Spirits, my dear Maria, conjured a phantom to my railed imagination. — I thought I beheld hirn covered with wounds — and flitting on the bosom of the deep. — Again I saw him struggling with the waves, and endeavouring to gain the shore — then, as overpowered, he sunk beneath them: — and was Swallowed in the tremen dous gulf. My misery now cannot be described — I fell upon my knees — I called him by the most tender epithets — the name of Luzy was echoed by the rocks — the woods — the lonely beach — all feem to fed my Sorrows — and to invoke the lifeless author of them to return. As 1 still kneeled, absorbed in expectation of Seeing him again~i was Suddenly brought to my senses, by perceiving myself raised from my knees — and by hearing a voice, in the gentlest accents entreating me to be composed— — turned about to behold the person who accosted me, and Saw a venerable old man, whose beard was white as Snow, endeavouring to Support me.

manner, and the tone in which he Spoke, interested me, and in Some measure restored me to reason— — apologised for my riidenefs — and added, that the grief in which I was immerfcd, was of So poignant and extraordinary a nature, that it ■ was impossible for anything in this life to afford me consolation. I thanked him for the trouble he had given himself — and was about to take my leave when he prevented me with this reply.
“If it be not too presumptuous, - Madam, may I entreat you to unravel to me the cause of so fixed a Sorrow? — This is the fourth time about this hour I have heard your accents of woe — and have been, until tonight, cautious of breaking in upon your retirement. Tonight, however, your despair appeared more violent than ever, and I could no longer command my Sell from offering you my counsel and assistance — they are both, thou daughter of asslidflon, devoted to you. — If it can be in my power to relieve the least of those pangs which I have seen you endure — I shall praise that Being who endues me with the means — and be but too happy, cost me what it may, in the accomplishment of it.”
The earnest manner of the Hermit (for Such he appeared to be) the ssncerity which seemed to hang on all he uttered — together with the reverence of his form, induced me to grant his request.
- — .I told him that if the story of a miserable orphan could in any meafnre interest him, I would the next evening relate it to him.

** Orphan 1” repeated he — and he turned aside to conceal his tears.
1 thanked him for the part be Seemed to take in my misfortunes, and astured him, I would not fail to be at the rock the next night at the Same hour. — I then bade him adieu, and returned to the castle.
It is now almost time for me to Set off in order to be true to my appointment — I shall take nan nette with me — though the appearance of the man forbids me to fear a deceit. You will, no doubt, blame me for this incautious behaviour — you may call it madness — or folly. — Alas, my dear friend, I have nothing to say in justification of it! — Yet the figure— — voice — the tears of this good man, seem to encourage nae to unbosom rayfelf to him — not that my doing so can avail, or restore tome my peace — There is, however, a degree of comfort in complaining to a pitying ear — to a Sympathising heart. — If you do not know this — you have never felt an extremity of grief.

WHEN I quitted your presence, charming
Vifloria, at Madame de sanfcerre’s, instead of embarking for Martinico as I told you, I accompanied, in disguise, my friend De Palmene to Italy. — I resolved to leave the world, as everything in it had now given me a disgust but one fair object whom 1 considered as lost to me for ever. Palmene could not persuade me from the resolution I had taken— — determined to accompany me to whatever retreat my fancy led me to make choice of — and we soon after embarked for ■sardinia, first giving out, that I was on board a ship then under weigh for Martinico from the port of Bordeaux.
When we arrived in this island, Palmene brought me to a solitary part of it, where he had an antiquated, castle, inhabited only by an old attendant. Here I resided forhe fnbhths. — At length I discovered that rock, where I was so blessed as to behold you. I visited it often, thinking it a place best calculated to indulge and cherish melancholy. I soon after took up my habitation in it, and at the same time assumed the dress of an anchorite.
Palmene often went privately to Paris in order to bring me an account of you. He there heard that the Marquis, your husband, treated you cruelly — and complained to many of your behaviour and hatred towards him, assigning that as
a prin
A %.

2>34
a principal cause for his absenting himself from you', and his attachment to other women.
- Unhappy at these constant reports, I agreed to accompany my friend in disguise the next time he went to France; and learning that you were gone to Spend ibme weeks at Trois Riviere, we determined to follow you thither, and conceal ourselves in the neighbourhood of that enchanting place. There I had an opportunity of beholding you often when you wandered with your friend Madame de sanscerre in the parks and woods unattended. One night I had very nearly discovered myself to you as 1 was endeavouring to make my escape without being observed—
— moise, however, which I made in attempting it, so alarmed you both, as to occasti on your quitting the wood immediately. — I want words to deferibe to you the emotion which too possession of my bosom on feeing you approach, and in being so frequently near you — my heart was ever ready to betray me on such occasions, and it was with difficulty I could prevent myself from falling at your feet.
Another night I followed you, accompanied by Palmene, to Madame de sanfeerre’s; and during the course of the evening, as we were near the castle, we heard that you had quitted it to return to Trots Riviere. We directly mounted our horses, and taking our two faithful domestics with us, pursued your carriage with as much swiftness as possible. We found you in a Situation that inr deed required our attention. A man Had forced you into his chaise— — shrieks and cries which we heard ct a distance, gave additional speed to our coursers. We were happy enough to refeue you from the barbarous violence of the Duke de Maurice; anti whilst we were engaged in recalling you to life, he made his escape in the confusion.
Ah,
 55
/ '*
Ah, my God! what were my agitations when I beheld you in my arms, breathless, and to all appearance on the very verge of the grave !I, wept over your almost lifeless form — I dared to imprint a thousand kisses on your lips — I implored you in the agony of my soul to revive — and 1 whispered in your ear that it was Luzy who called you to life. I should certainly have made myself known, but that I feared the malice of your enemies would have styled that meeting an intentional one on your part — and I would rather have died, than have Suffered your spotless fame to have been so cruelly ssandered : therefore, when I beheld the Surgeon approach, I muffled myself up, and after he had given you all the assistance in his power, I attended you with Palmene to Trois Riviere. Nannette was So engrossed by her grief that she Icarcely looked at us. — “We were in a great measure rejoiced at that circumstance, and took a hasty leave, assuring her, at the same time, we would call again to know how you did. We again concealed ourselves in the neighbourhood, and we soon after learned that you were perfe^ly recovered.
One day I beheld you weeping in a lonely grove, where with many tears andstghsyou called upon my name. — Madame de Sanfcerre, in a short time, joined you — and chid you for encouraging your ideas to dwell upon a man whom it was your duty to think no more of. — Never shall I forget * the Silent wge with which you listened toiler lecture! —, You lyrung your lovely hands — you clasped them with a wildness of Sorrow which pierced my soul — you afterwards embraced her, and entreated her not to despise you. As for my part, I Could hardly refrain from showing myself, and catching you in my arms. — Palmene, however, withheld • my transports — and kept me within the bounds of moderation.
We
V
236 THE H E R M IT
We shortly after quitted France, and returned to Sardinia — I, with unfeigned grief, perceived that your faithful bosom nourished my idea — and I supposed that that circumstance prevented your behaving towards the Marquis with that degree of affection, which would perhaps have converted him to virtue and to you.
I therefore gave out, through the means of palmene’s faithful attendant, that I had been lost in that very ship which had sailed for Martinico about the time that I saw you at Madame Dc sanscerre’s — and he contrived to relate the story to Solignac himself, who had never Seen him in the marquis’s Service, and who did not know him any further than as a coffeehouse frequenter, where he had industriousty Spread this report a bout a quarter of an hour before he saw Solignac enter the hotel. The vessel I have already mentioned had actually foundered at sea, and as my friend the Comte knew it was in that ship which I intended to embark, he gave me up as gone for ever. I imagined this news would at first'causc you Some pangs, but that when they subsided,
, ' would place your affeflions on a worthier obje61, and make your husband happy. In the meanwhile I abandoned myself to grief and despair '■ — remonstrances could induce me to re visit
4
any place again'where I might chance to behold you. The torments I Suffered in feeing you at Trois Riviere, without ever daring to make you sensible of my astlifitions, cost me so dearly, that I could not form a wish to repeat them — and unless I could look on you as mine, I desired never to behold you more. — The reflection of your being in the possession of a happier man, was sufficiently cruel in itself, and 1 needed not the farther misery of becoming a fpe^ator of his felicity — of ' frequently

frequently feeing .the irestimable prize he gained, when I lost my Victoria— — comparison between us was not to be born!
I Spent my time from that period in the rock — my food was the Simplest in the world — my usual dress was just what you there beheld me in — and ray bed was many nights the bare earths My friend Palmene participated in all my affliflions — in all my austerities — and we lived like men.dif gusted with the world, and willing to hide themselves from the haunts of mortals.
The Castle au Bois we knew was not many' miles from our retreat — but no one inhabited it, excepting a poor family, whom in our journey hither we were So happy as to have it in our power to relieve — and who could never have known us again, had they chanced to see us in our new metamorphosis.
When I first heard your voice, lamenting my untimely fate — I was buried in meditation within my cell. — I started. — tpalmene, who was with me, was as much amazed as mysbls. — We drew near the cavity in the rock, and listened to your heartrending accents. We were undetermined whether to appear or nof — biit my emotions were So violent at that time — my ecstacies so great, that I should ineyitably have difeovered myself immediately. — You, however, staid only a short while — and we followed you, unperceived, lest any accident might have befallen you on the way.'
The fecond' timie I almost resolved to speak to you — but my doubts of your husband’s death deterred me fronvit — and I was determined, were he living, not to nrtake myself known, hoping that time would wear pff the keen edge of your affliction, and iafpire you, with an afsedfion for lau fanne.

The third visit you paid the rock, produced ng other consequences than the two preceding ones had done — but the fourth time I could not com jtiand myself— — Sorrows Seemed to increase— —. poignancy of them was exquisite— — adopted the only method I could think of, to learn your present Situation, in beginning to hear your story — and no words — no pen can do justice to the felicity of my soul, when I learned that the bar was removed which alone obstrudled the completion of our happiness.

Never, my dear Solignac, never could I bear
the stings of my own heart — the biiternels of your reproaches, had I injured you as you suspect, — My friendship for you is unimpaired — and the strongest proof I could have given of it, was that which has drawn on me your diistleasure.
You may remember that on cjuitting Clarence, after 1 had received my father’s Summons to attend him in Italy, I Swore that if anything should happen to interrupt ray union with the mistress of my fond Soul, I would bury myself in Some obscure retreat, and hide me for ever from the world. At first you laughed at my romantic resolirtion — • but finding me fixed in it — you, in as Solemn a manner. Swore to be the companion of my confinement: — nay, you even vowed that though you should, have enlisted under the banners of Cupid, you would leave the object of your love.,
and dedicate your future hours to friendship only,

As we travelled into Italy, we beheld the
I J J
charming Madame de sanscerre,; who had, at the •tender age of eighteen, buried a cruel husband, after having experienced the most barbarous treatment from him. She was in her weeds — and appeared exquisitely beautiful. — You admired her extremely — and shortly owned that you loved her pashonately. — Your friendship, however, still conquered your wish of attaching yourself to this amiable woman, and in Spite of all! could urge to the contrary, you acco. npanied me 4o Italy.
I will pass over my misfortunes after that period, and hasten to my return to France after the marchioness De lausanne’s marriage.

determined to be absent Some time from Italy — and had alforesolved never again to Set ray foot in France. You instantly reminded me of your promise to go with me towsbatever desart spot my fancy pointed out — and insisted upon performing it. In order to prevent So generous an intention., which vvou'ld have been fatal to your own felicity, and that of the lovely Madame De sanscerre, I assured you I had altered my Scheme — and declared I should accept of an invitation given me by the Marquis De Louvoi, then general of mar tinico, to go over to him, and Spend Some little while in a part of the w’orld which many think - worth Seeing, until time could have meliorated, in Some measure, the keeness of that afhistioii which was, at this period. So poignant and dif tressful to me. Ealmene,, who had foriwornsrom a former disappointment, the tenderness of unions with any of the Sex, desired, through a frolic, as he termed it, before you, to accompany me to the West Indies. — I agreed to his going with me to Bordeaux — but not a step furthet. — He
La appeared
244 THE H E R M I T
appeared to acquiesce in this determination, but protested he would live in Italy ever after, unless I conquered my disgust to France, and coniented to return to it, in which cale he would (ee it again with pleasure.
You tried to persuade me to Suffer you to become my companion in my voyage to Martiriico — but I dissuaded you from that proposal, as I plainly foresaw it would have been death to your repoic as a lover, as also to that of Madame Dc sanscerre, who indeed, at that time, imagined she Saw you only as an amiable and accomplished friend. I, however, knew better her Sentiments ol you — for from the first moment of your meet ing, I perceived that Cupid had not done his work by halves. I objected to your going with me to Bordeaux, under a pretence of its only tending to protraild; the distressof parting — but, .in reality, lest you should find out that my intention was not to go at all. Palmene, who had nothing to engage him in the world, and who loved me well enough to leave it with me (particularly as I chose Italy for my place of residence) obtained my consent to bear a part of my Sufferings.
As to the uneasiness the report of my death could have given you — I did not hope that you would have regretted it — but as you knew what it was to love with ardour, you must have thought death desirable after Such a disappointment as mine.
These are the only reasons I have to allege in my defence. — If I have adfed wrong, impute it to an error in judgement, but do my friendship justice.
I conjure you, my dear Solignac, to let me See you immediately. — If you still regard me, I claim this request as a token of it. — Ifyoii do not

Such a man, my dear Maria, does not often appear! And Surely heaven has formed for him the only woman in. the world, who could flatter herself with poffesting, unrivalled, such a heart., Poor Solignac! methinks the air of Sardinia diaes hot agree with him — hers not so handsome— — ’ so graceful as he was in Paris. — He is toolive my at times — at others too dull! — He met me in the wood yesterday walking with Luzy. — He ex elairaed against a conversation so private, and Swore the Comte was become a downright monopolizer. — The charming creature laughed at his Sears of him, and appeared to rally. — He, however, without seeming to intend it, soon slipped away, and left Solignac to entertain me alone.

“Tell me, my beloved raistress — Suffer me to penetrate into those ideas which feern So greatly disturbed — no common circumstance could have thus ruffled your tranquillity.”

“w, sanscerre, ” cried I to myself, .when Solignac was out of sight, thou art, indeed, a strange, inconsistent, ridiculous mortal! — Here is a man — a very good sort of a man — whom you loved the other day to a degree of enthusiasm; — ' whom you have promised to marry — and whose fidelity you have made a cruel trial oh — Here - now, I Say, because he is not quite So handsome as Luzy — because he does not convmand So much ready wit — nor So elegant a flow of language — nor offer a nosegay with So much grace — nor press a lady’s fingers with So gentle, nor So tender an air — and So because he is not So very perfect — you treat him ill— — view him with disdain— — oblige him to quit your presence.”

cut the story short — I will tell you that solig nac apologi2 cd shr daring to resent a little harmless. coquetry of mine — and I was brought to acknowledge myself wrong in having exercised it. — In fine, Luzy Soon after appeared — and partly by perfuafion, and partly by grave le^ures,. they made me promise, that on the day which gives Vidtoria the title of Luzy, I am to astume that of Solignac. The creature has been arrogant upon it, I affure you, ever since— — it is with difficulty that I keep him in any tolerable degree of order — I endeavoured, indeed, to humble him Sometimes by a fly sort of flirtation with the elegant Palmene — but the man is: iniensible to Such, malice — and Seems to Set it at defiance. — IDO not know but he has hit upon the only method of curing me of Such folly.

, Palmene, who applied to the Marquis De laui anne in behalf of the good old people who re hided in this Castle, and who are now, by our vi£loria, ^’s bounty, very comfortably fettled in a habitation of their own, has made a match between their youngest daughter and a Servant of his, one of the most worthy fellows in the universe— — young folks like each other — and their wedding has been Solemnised with, the greatest festivity. They are to be fixed on one of the Marquis’^s estates, which is at no great distance, from the old couple’s dwelling.
We are Soon to be in Paris — we shall first, however, pay our refpedis at Belvoir Castle. — adieu^j, dear Savillon,

Thus it is, my dear viqoria, with all libertine — They laugh at religion, which would put a restraint upon licentiousness — but w’hen that awful moment' comes, which is to convey them they know not whither — ah, what doubts — what pangs — what horrors! — Though it should be granted that religion is a phantom, would it not be Safer to be guided by it? — It is at least a harmless one, and will lead us to no ill. — On the contray — it will Save us from committing actions which, in reasonable moments, we would blush at having performed — not because they infringe on virtue • — for virtue can only be staunch where religion lives, but from a certain fear of the world which is natural to those who live in it— — what consolation on a dying bed to Say, “I have hopes — I have been promised Salvation — I have endeavoured to obtain it 1 — If there is a god (which it is my in ^t terest to believe) 1 am Secure of happiness— — not, there is comfort in an unpolutedconscience, which vas my heaven on earth. — Poor La Bert — we will draw the curtain over her frailties — and only remember what they were, that we may endeavour to avoid them.

WE hourly regret your absence, my dear
Julia, and think Belvoir Is not Belvoir without you. — Our rural sports, are however continued — and we have been present at a rustic marriage, which has given new life to the happy people about us. The pretty Sophia was united to nannette’s brother a week ago. — We danced on the green where the charms of the artless bride had So often shone conspicuous — and in truth there never was a more lovely couple. — Luzy danced' a good deal vrith her — as did Savillon and the Marquis De, Villars. — She was the queen of the night — and became the honours that were paid her. A circumstance happened that I will not omit to relate, because I knosv you will have the pleasure of
lausrliing
 59
\
laughing at me about it. — In fal I deserve your ridicule — and \vill therefore give you: an opportunity of exercising it.
Among the visitors who were that day invited, came a beautiful young married woman, who i just arrived from Italy. — her name De St, Clare, monsieur De St. Clare saw her at Bologna — and after a courisbip of a very few months made her his, and brought her to bis estate near Belvoir. — She is tall —; well shaped — has piercing black eyes — and a beautiful languor in them which interests in her favour all who behold them— — has, however, a Spice of of coquetry in her dispofition that her looks do not give you reason to inppose — but which I discovered very soon, as you shall judge.
Upon luzy’s entrance into she Saloon, she Seemed amazed — she arose— — eonsidered him wdth attention — she evidently liked his person— — after Settling her and adjusting her features, she
by the most refined art drew him towards her to' admire a snuffbox, which she bad produced as a curious piece of workmanship. Upon his approach, she put it in his hands with an air which was perfectly charming — and began a conversation with him. So pleasant and So witty in itself, as engaged him to draw a seat near hers, and keep it up with Spirit. Here, my dear Solignae, I felt an uneasy sensation. — He handed her to dinner — he Sat himself by her fide — he helped her to the most exquisite delicacies — he played with her fau' — he ventured'to draw out a role from her bouquet,. which he fastened to his coat with an air of grace' and gallantry, that to you I need not deferibe. — I' biustied — my bosom throbbed — a tear had almost started. — You must not suppose' ' that I was, during this Scene, ncgledbed. He sat opposite to me — his eyes would often meet mine, when they would Speak “unutterable tmngsf^ If I
Spoke a
26o the hermit
Spoke, he was all attention — when I sang, he Seemed to forget everybody but Victoria. — Yet I was uneasy. — — Madame de St. Clare I regarded as a dangerous rival. — Her rosy lips — her white and ^ven teeth — the beauty of her hand and arm — all which she endeavoured to show pff on thisoccj^i > on to the highest advantage — perplexed and confused me — I regretted already my fate — and tiiought Tread its unhapplnefs.
In the evening we assembled on a large lawn, and were entertained with Ibme beautiful fireworks which were played from the adjacent gar,, and which formed a most enchanting sight from the delightful Spot where we Sat to view them. — Madame De St. Clare, during this Scene, strove to attract Luxy who was standing near me, and making Some observations on the particular magnifidence of a Sun that was then letting off. She held in her hand an apple which she proposed to throw — and in a wild and lively manner declared, atajanta like, she would run for it with any gentleman who would accept the challenge. All s the men but Luzy avowed themselves ready to engage with her in the race. The Marquis De vil lars, approached, and, in particular, entreated that he should ast the part of Hippomenes on this occasion. She looked at Luzy. — He was polite — ^ he gracefully offered his Services also — she accepted of them, and discarded the Marquis. The apple was thrown — they Set off — she outstripped the, winds — and Luzy, through gallantry, determined that she should conquer. — She had very nearly obtained the victory, when in her easrerness to Snatch at it — she unluckily gave a painful turn to her foot, and fell. — Every person flew towards her — and I among the number. When we drew near, I perceived that Luzy had thrown himself by her, and had haff raised her from the ground. She, however.
t
  ai
ever, still Sat on it, and her head rested on his bosom. Madame De St. Clare either was — or pretended to be faint — volatiles, drops, cc. were administered, and sbe was at length able to arise, though not without all the ajiiduiiy of the Comte.
When the dance on the green commenced, no one could prevail on her to join in it but Luzy. — In short, her behaviour vas So particular and ridiculous, that it occasioned much mirth to everybody excepting me.
After her departure, the Comte was rallied on the Subje^ of her partiality. He laughed heartily ^ ■ — protested the lady did hint too much honour and 1 heard him, in a whiiper to Lindor declare, that such Jlrong love brad never beeji made him bejore.
Men, my dear Julia, be they ever lb lensible and amiable, are always vain of a lady’s favour. — Heconfeffed that he believed he enjoyed her’s • — and was one of the very strst to ridicule her folly. This made me, in Some measure easy — but when we were alone, he expressed to me Such a thorough disgust of her behaviour, contrasted with the delicate one (as he was pleased to call it) of his too happy Vi: oria’s, as made me feel absolutely ashamed of my unjust fears. — I told birn of them, rallying at the Same time my own folly, and placing it in the most laughable point of yiew — he Snatched me to his bosom — heafkedme, ' if his love had been a common one P He astu/ed me, That so Jar from being touched by her C farms, he had thought they were thrown away upon a woman so indelicate, and so itnprudent in her condubl.
Thus, my Julia, have I related a circumstance which wilstrot Sail, _iiua strr'ei of drawing on me ' your mirth — and’which you must allow, cbnlider ing my being aware of that, to be an unparalleled piece of her generosity.
Nannettc
J
z
Nannette refuses to marry a wealthy farmer of this place, merely because sbe will not part with xne. The Comte, however, insrsts upon her making the man happy, promising that he will place him in affluence on a little estate which he means to purchase for them near Clarence; and that Nannette, in that cafe, will be always near me. She evidently likes the honest man, who ^ with gratitpde accepts of this proposal — and I hope to compromise the matter before we leave Belvoir.
I Snail expect that you will go with us to Clarence. — — The whole party here, in one voice, has engaged to accompany us thither in a fortnight— — shall call on you in parls~but not to stay long. — After paying our respeqs at Versailles, we mean to bid adieu for Some time to that seat of noise and Solly, and take up our residence in ♦the ever dear and charming sbades of my beloved Clarence. Adieu — embrace our Solignac tenderly For us.

Madame D e L U z Y, to the Marquis
D E PAL M E N j;.
WE expe6i your arrival at Clarence, dear
Marquis, with impatience. We look forward to it, as an event which will complete the Scenes of happiness that we are engaged in. Madame De Villeneuf, Madame De Savillon, and Madame De Solignac, protest with me that your ^ company cannot be Spared on this occasson. You have promised to give it to us Soon — and in return I gave you ray word to tell you all that pastes in the mean while.j
When we arrived at Paris, we prepared for our appearanceat versailles. The drawing rooih was a very full one — but hst majesty did not pass us stightly over. — He congratulated me on my marriage, and paid me some compliments, ac coripanied with that air of graciousness So peculiar to him, which ave them charms that I was not insenssbrc to.
Our reception from the queen was very flattering. The Comte De Artois was by when we had the honour of killing her majesty’s hand. On our retiring from the circle, he joined us. He presented me to Luxy, telling him, that he had once loved me— — that my virtue and attachment to himy had Jo Jieeled my bosom against his perjuaftons ' — that he had quitted me in despair
** my lord, ” added hq, “she was then proof against my love, how much more invulne rable to it must she be when in the postestion of the man, whose bare idea at that time, made her
'infensible to every other individual of the Sex I — I ^ ' must
264
must tell you, ” puriued the Comte, with an air of gallantry, “that in calling this amiable creature yours— — •! upon you as the happiest.man in the universe.”
You may luppose our friend received these Speeches with no less grace than they were spoken—
— the vanity of my heart I must declare to you that tste whole court appeared charmed with his air and address..^the ladies, you know, ever distinsfuisbed him — he does not (eem to have lost
Q * j
one atom or their favour.
In fine, we have bidden adieu to vcrsailles for
one while. — We fet off with our friends the next.
#
day for Clarence, whole woods and rural beauties, are in high perfeqion.
Amidst this Scene of felicity, my good friend, we adore the beneficent author of our present joys, and remember, with penitence, thole hours we pasted in bitterly complaining of our fate. We are become converts to this truth: that the af ■fiidlion which heaven sends, should always be born with resignation — and our hopes of better prospefifs ought never to be given up — for that God who chastises us, can give us comfort, and nothing is So pleating in his Sight as an entire confidence in his mercy.
Adieu. — We await your coming with impatience. -
