Esq:
jf)far Charles! unfurl that thoughtful brow, And laugh with me, and tell me how

And wind him with the curling: breeze

Parnaftfus Safe in dofrel rhime;
Cull every flower the mules ffied

To ornament the poet’s head.
And ev’ry ffirub the Graces nurse

To decorate their favourites verse. How can you when true Genius fires.
When Aganippe's fount inipires

With delicacy false lock up
f
From public view the golden cup, Presented from Apollo's hand;
But with this Ipirited command?

Drink

Drink deeply from it now and then

And in it dip the magic pen
Which Fancy made and brought to you When first poetic air you drew.
Hither Fancy! come along.
Fill the goblet, join the Song;
Then strike the lute and lead me through
A sentimental hop or two
■>
And, pray thee, don’t too lightly deem
Of the wild, iplay foot poet’s theme

Because it introduces here
The story of a toricfs bier t
And now, Thalia you must

And leave us to this tale of woe

Poor Torick dead! that Muses turn An eye of pity o’er his urn.
And, drooping, quit the Sportive For the deep, gloomy yew tree’s Ihade

Melpomene in tears attends

The tomb where all of Torick ends

All! but his works, and thole shall be

Thy comic vein, thy plaintive tale

Will o’er each feeling breast prevail;
When all this little, paltry world
9
Is into grand confusion hurl’d.
%
With all thy weight of merit, Sterne
Why did you
for our sakes, learn
To keep that fine fpun frame of thine
Within a more contracted line
7
/
Not gallop o’er each hedge and style
Thy brilliant Sancy to beguile?
And now, Fhalia,
come avain.
And
%
ive me Friflram Shandy's pen;
✓
For Friflram Shandy we’ll describe,
His ev’ry
Ikip and gibe

In
In Ipite of Chejierfieldian rules.
And the dull jargon of the schools
y
Spite of all his lordfhip*s graces

And the frigid, mean embraces.
He to his bastard recommends
In foreign climes for prudent ends
y

we’ll laugh with Sfrijiram and bring forth The blunders of his hapless birth.

For know, in spite of all he can.
The poet is no more than man
5
Although from Helicon he’s brought,
N
And wishes to enjoy the thought
Of living, when the soul is flown
%
To her eternal, blissful home.
By
By handing to the future age
The humour of his magic page:
/
\
Still must he laugh and talk, and then Indulge., and laugh and talk again.
Th’ ill tim’d question ’bout the clock. To shandy’s Sather gave a Ihock, Which the homunculus mi/plac’d.
And all his secret life dilgrac’d.
But, Shandy, if thy hobby horfe caus’d thee many a dirty cross,
Sfhe great original is your’s
j
And immortality Secures;
Besides, although there may be Ihades

Oh, dosior Slop! thy forceps dire plung’d thee once more into the mire; Made little Shandy quite the (port Of gossips in and out of court;

And cowards, fools and knaves shall be The objects of her charity.
Then surely Reynolds will excuse,
An idle, truant, laughing muse,

That oft’ in person will attend him. And counsel quaint will freely lend him Then Reynolds never can refule.
The gambols of this frolic mule;
A mule that ever has, and will Protect his charailer from ill.
Give up life, au fancies power

To cheer his every anxious hour.
Hold! cries. Sir Critic, won’t you brand
with infamy the murdering hand;

Laughs till She bursts at such alarms

Treats mere critics with defiance.
She never v/ilhes their alliance

With indignation now stie burns. And gladly to that friend returns.
Who gave her, with a gentle hand And feeling heart, each sweet command,
What
lo
«
What to avoid, and what to fly. During her term of favery. Brave, gentle Spirit! yet e’en he
Has often met
7
Whose noble mind.
Their virtues cheerfully impart Lo man at large., without a dream Of self’s attractive, darling theme;
That luscious, dear.
Which Sways alike the clown, the king;
In every place, at every hour,.
Gives strange examples bf it’s power.

But whether in poetry or prole Is immaterial to those.
