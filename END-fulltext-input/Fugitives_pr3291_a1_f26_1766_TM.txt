My Intimacy with the new married Pair still continued; and I Srequently heard the Confort of my Friend mention with great Respect the Name

told me, that his Lady, whom he had osteii importuned on that Head, had at last gained
the consent of miss M -- -- -- to

I undertookthis Office, with pleasure, and must confess, it was Matter of satissaction to me, to find so great a Trust reposed in me by these amiable Ladies.
In Effect, having expunged all real Names, and Articles of private Concern, I digested the Work into the F orm which

now it bears.
As to the Style of these Memoirs, I Shall only say, it is Such, in genera], as is usiial in epistolary Correspondence, except only, that where Some particular Circumstances have

The Descriptions, I believe, will be found accurate, and corresponding to the best Accounts. If the Scenery is sometimes extraordinary, it is no more So than the Nature of the Story must unavoidably oc c^ston it to be. As to the mo 1 al Reflex ions interspersed, they are such as appeared to me ap postte to the Subject, and consequently underwent but few Alterations.

I know not, my Dear, whether you have ever heard me So much as mention the Authors of my Being, since I could never refied on the loss of them without Anguish, as one of my greatest mis fortunes, and a Prelude to all those others 1 was destined'toiexperience.
It was In the City of Brijlol that I first beheld the Light, .My Father was a Clergyman, descended from an honourable and ancient, though not a wealthy Family hr Walese, my Mother was the Daughter of a rich West-india Merchant, who was So disobliged with her Choice of a consort, sthat from the Day they were joined, he never would consent to See his Child. My Parents bore this with a becoming Patience; happy in ach other, they lived cheerful, free,

and innocent. My Grandfather by the Father's Side, was far from being displeased at the Match; he often Said, he looked on my Mother (though riow entirely void of all the Gifts, of Fortune) to be a treasure which exceeded all Wealth.
%
%
Such were his Sentiments; although 'at the same Time his own Fortune was extremely ssender, and his Son, at his Death, which happened Soon after, found he had nothing to depend on but his Benefice : But this, to a Man of his Moderation, was Sufficient; he alked of Heaven but the Foffeffion of, his Love in a State above Want, Heaven granted him that, and he was happy, because he esteemed himself sh.
Two Years had elapsed, when my Mother proved pregnant, and, in the usual Period of Time, brought him me as a •pledge of their Loves. It is Scarce poshble to express my father’s Joy on this Occa -- fion; he was a person of the tenderest Feelings of Humanity, and his consort was by this Event grown still more dear to him: often would he take me in his

Arms, and fervently address himself m Prayer to High Heaven to shower down on me its choicest Bleshngs; to make me wise and virtuoys, and grant me be sides those other Gilts of Fortune denied to him.
I
'As to my other cruel Grandfather, he could never be prevailed on even to See me, though my Parents had often endeavoured to introduce me to him, in order to Soften his heart. He totally re fused all Kind of Connexion with them or me, and most unnaturally resolyed to leave his Wealth to Strangers, rather than to a Daughter who had once difbbliged
him., '
My Education was the principal Care ef my Parents, and was, as much as pos fible, under their condud and Inspection.: But before this could be far advanced, my Mother died, and my Father retired to a Small house, a few Miles distant from the City; no longer able to endure the Sight of a Mansion, where he had once tasted So much Joy, now
turned into a house of Mourning,

Here, Serim^ began my Sorrows; and from this .Dra may I date all my mrs' fortunes.

Sacred to his' Grief; which ended in a Melancholy, that preyed on his Spirits, and reduced him to the Shadow of hi' ' Self, >

Sequestered from Social Converse and the Haunts of Men, he Spent the tedioi^ Hours in all the Duties of a religious Life. Worn as he was with Care, sibk ness at last Seized him; well he knew it the Harbinger of Death, and in Proportion as it approached, contrary to the Generality of Mortals, he grew calmer, more composed, aid even mox cheer still.

In his, dying Moments, my Fafher^^ «onfigned me to the Care of his Sister, who was by this Time become the Re HD of a Gentleman of Fortune, and who promised to take the greatest Care of me, for whom she had indeed always appear • to entertain a great Regard.
My Father embraced me tenderly, snd turning to my Aunt: ‘ My dear sister, laid he,, when. my beloved So --. 'phia died, to me she commended this. Offspring of our mutual Love. Alas L -

Indeed I had Caush1 Saw him no more; for within a few Hours he e: §: -‘ pired, and my Aunt took Possession of the House, which, as Soon as she had fettled all affairs relative to my deceased Parent, she quitted, taking me with herr to a Seat of iiex kte huiband’s in the Country,
»
To do Justice to her Memory, I will own I had no Reason to complain of her Behaviour towards me, from the Time of my leaving my father’s flouse till my Sixteenth Year; during which Interval I was educated with her own Daugk ter Charlotte, who was nearly of my Age.
About this Time the Son and Heir of Sir yarned Lovell, a neighbouring Baro jiet. of a great estate, secretly paid his
B 4.,. Addresses
>

Addresses to this my Coiifin, contrary t6; the Commands of his Father, who would. have matched him elsewhere..
My Aunt was well acquainted with'the affair, and encouraged the young Gentleman in his Disobedience, endeavouring,, by every Means in her Power, to firomote a Match between her daughter and the Son of the Baronet.,.,
But charloue not he Art of Leep^ ing a lover’s Affedfions.., Shewas indeed kmdsome; but she had at that Time So large a Share of affe<5fation, that her haughty and ridiculous Airs proved diff gustsul to her Lover, and, in the End, lost her the Conquest which her Eyes had ■gained.
My Aunt, who had Seen with pleasure this .growing Passion, you may well imagine, was chagrined TO perceive it decreasing, and would Sain have renewed its Force : But the Youth had good sense, and his awakened reason conquered in Time those Ardours, which the Power of Charms merely exterior had excited in his Breast.

Whilst Affairs were thus fitusted, I was removed to a friend’s house at Some Distance. On my Return, my Aunt advanced to receive me, accompanied by Mr. Lovell. I had never Seen him before. He Seemed greatly consuse.', and handed me out of the Coach with a trembling Emotion: Then, turning to my Aunt, ‘ Mrs. Alneyf ldsd. he,,, (that was her Name, ‘ Is this Lady a Relation ?' She replied ‘ Yes, Sir, it is the. Girl I ‘ mentioned to you.: My Brother, dying,, ‘ lest her to my Care.' ‘ Your Niece f ‘ Then, Madam, with your Permission— — me, while my Cheeks were dyed with Scarlet) ‘ A fine young Lady!

I will confess to you, that I
was greatly struck with the agreeable Figure and engaging address of this a miable young Gentleman.. He was just turned of Eighteen, tall, well shaped, and graceful;. The rose of Health bloomed •n Jjis Cheek, his Eyes were large, black,

and piercing, his Hair and Eyebrows of a dark Colour; his Manner was manly. Sensible, Sprightly, and engaging. In a Word, he Seemed to poffess all that my Imagination could Sorm agreeable in, his Sex.
His Visits vrere, from this Time more frequent, at my aunt’s; yet his Beha. viour grew, more cool than ever towards. miss Charlotte. The Mystery of this Mrs. Alney, easily penetrated : That Lady perceived Mr. Lovell had conceived a Passion for me, in consequence of which,, in a little Time ..after, I began to be^mal
treatedo.
On the least Pretence imaginable I was.. ordered to my Chamber. I'could not condud myself by any Rule which would. not offend : If I Spoke in Company, I; was too forward, if I held my Peace, I was Julien. My Pride was often excepted m against; and my Cousin, now my Enemy; lised to tell me ‘ Ishat I ought not to encourage So proud a Spirit, Since my

The Pleading of a Man. we love is mufic to our Ears. I stood fixed to hear ' him, and forgot my fromise. 1 let him,, know, in my 1 urn, how much Mrs. a/ ney had dtceived us both : He then fell at my Feet, and breathed the most ardent Vows; I recollected,, and urged my promise; he argued ‘ 1 hat to deceive, Deceivers was but just He pressed, me eagerly to admit of his Suit, pro • the most respectful Behaviour.

Have you beheld, Senna, the Welcome with which the rough Blasts of Aujter are received by the ripened Corn, when his rude tempestuous Breath low bends the waving Harvest, and threatens Ruin to the farmer’s Hope: — With Such a Welcome, trembling and appal’d, did I receive the rough Salute of this my uncouth Lover, whose very Form leemed a contradidion to his Suit; while his Voice, far from, being atuned to the Sweet Notes of Love, broke forth in hoarse Murmurs from the Hollow of his misshapen 'I'runk, like Winds pent up, and struggling for a pas iage.

Thus I lived for Some Time, Mr. lo nsell constantly visiting me at Set Times, I “knewdiis flour, and was therefore Surprised to Tee him enter one Day Sooner than usual: Concern Sat on his Brow, and his Mind seemed labouring with Something his Tongue was at a Loss to utter. For slime Minutes he remained filent; at last he "thus began:

Things. My Compliance would (when ‘ the first Transports of a violent Love ‘ liad Subfided) render me contemptible ‘ in your Eyes, as one who had,, poorly ‘ endeavoured to raise her Fortune at the ‘ Expense of her Integrity.

Not to disappoint my Lover In every dshing, L complied with this proposal;,, and he named a Day, on which accord ingly we Set forward for London.
Soon after: we arrived, he placed me with one Lady Sewef a Cousin of his deceased Mother. She received me as. her Companion, and being made ac -- quainted with my Story, promised me her Favour and Protection.
4
Soon .after, Mx. Lovell was Summoned into the Country:. He Said he could not think of leaving me: I used every Argument I could think on, to persuade him into a Compliance. At length I prevailed on .him, and he. left me in a Situation agreeable enough, the Pain excepted of parting, from one whom I really loved. At Parting,, he presehted me with a Miniature of himself, which I hung to my Watch, and which afterwards
©ccafioaed an odd Adventure...
■G g Iff

$
If I thought myself happy where was situated. Lady Sewel Seemed .no less, pleased with me.. she.was a person who hept much Company, and I was, ia consequence, introduced by her to the fashionable World: But of all those who frequented her house, the most parti, culaf Visitors were Sir Brooks
and the young Lord Clarey; the former of these was a Gentleman of a manly Deportment, and many shiriingaccom plishnaents; the latter, though, to do him. justice, he had a quick Genius and great Talents, joined to a high Spirit, had yet So. much of Pride, arid fb great a Mixture of the Libertine in his charader,
V •• • > ... y ^
as weighed in the equal Balance of Reashii. would preponderate,, and; turri the Scale against them. With. these, however, he. pasted in general for a person pf a noble
Spirit, and an accomplished .Gentleman,.
-
One Day, when both these Smtors (for. Such they really were) had just left lady ■snvel she retired to her closet, and Sent me a Note, importing that she would be, glad to Speak with me there. I attended, and found her Ladyship sitting in a very
thoughtfus?

Situation?’ — ‘ Your Lady ship, (replied I), ‘ has loaded me. with unmerited Favours ‘ I have daily cause, as now .to return .... ‘ Hold, Child (Said she) I did not want to,
‘ alk your Thanks, lam happy if Icaa ‘ contribute to the Felicity of one deserving person; but all the Return I ask is ‘ Sincerity: I have, ‘terefa, ever esteemed ^ you a person of good sense and an un derstanding above your years; and I am about to propose a (i^uestion to you, ‘ in which I entreat you without disguise f to poffess me of your real Sentiments i Will you promise me this? — *
«
* Though I could not conceive what ■ ^ should follow this sh Solemn Preparation,
'yet I accorded to her ladyship’s Desire, and she thus proceeded. ‘ I be ‘ Sieve I need not tell you that Sir George ^ and Lord Clarey both regard me with. ' the Eyes of Love; as they are both ‘ ardent, they are both assiduous; the happiness of each Seems dependant on ^■"mine. It is a long While since these.

‘ Gentlemen professed a Passion for me, * ‘ and it is now Time to declare in Fa -- your either of one or the other. I am ‘ the more difposed to this, because hav -- ing hitherto, as I am entirely unpre

* between them, L fear Some Mischief ^ arise; but I am perfedly certain, ' ^ when my Choice is known, the Success
less Lover will acquiesce in it, and silently deplore his Fate: — Speak then,,.
* and freely declare, which of these is, in your Opinion, most proper to possess,,
^ and my Fortune.’
I must own, Serina^, L was much embarrassed at this Qijestion; for though the Choice, was easy to an unprejudiced Per son between the two Gentlemen, yet, notwithstanding all that Lady Sewel had Said,
1 had Some Reason to imagine, that her Inclinations biassed her in Favour of Lord. Clarey. It i impossible for .any Woman, to regard two Lovers with an equal Af fe6tion, if she really likes either; — she must love, only one, or be indifferent to both. — = this I hinted at as modestly as I could to her Ladyship; but she still per. listed in. her Equality of.

was true, she Said, she did not love either with an ardent affedion, but alike esteemed them both. With this nice Distinc — tion, I was obliged to be. contented, and, being Sarther pressed, I gave my Opinion as Sollows; judge my dear Serina, with how much Justice,. and with how little ■ success.
‘ If then (Said I) your Ladyship infists, ‘ on my real Sentiments, they are these...
* In the first Place, I will not So much as ‘ suppose but both these Gentlemen love ‘ you equally, and both are at present.
• equally and warmly interested in your: ^ happiness: they are both Gentlemen.. ‘ of great Fortune and Accomplishments;
‘ and the World, in all Probability, looks
* on them nearly, with an equal Eye.. ‘ Therefore, Madam, we will suppose ‘ Sir George And his Lordship to be both, ‘ in every kespedl equal as Lovers; but
* your Ladyship cannot but look forward
* to that State, which is the Perfedfion ‘ of Love, Wedlock: Permit me then,, ‘ Madam, to suppose you joined witk.

^ Lover, you will poffess his Heart as ■ well as his Fortune and Title, nor are his other Accomplishments any Way interior to Lord Clarefi: And this is the ‘ .happiness I sincerely wish your Lady

‘ And this is your happy Scheme, miss ‘ 1‘erefa, (Said Lady Sewel) bless me! what *■ golden Days shall I enjoy? But sharkee,
‘ Child — Do you promise yoursels all * this with Mr. Lovell The Manner in which she Spoke tkese Words, not Teeming to require an answer, I withdrew, making an Apology. for the Liberty I had taken, which my Lady coldly Said, she was much obliged to me for, and after formally curt’fying, we Separated.
I could plainly perceive that I had really displeased Lady sewei by obeying her Commands, So dangerous a Thing is it to Speak one’s Mind in Such cases; but i this was a Lesson which I had not yet learned, though I was tolerably able to Support an Argument; and indeed the Vanity of displaying that Talent, .more than, once cost me dear.

But the Peer,, one Morning, enterings the Saloon, before Lady Sewel was up, found me there alone reading, and, glad of the Opportunity, began a difcourse with me, which Iwould fain have avoided,, but that' good Manners obliged me to entertain his Lordship. — After Some Time,, I was Surprised to hear the easy Astiirance with which this base Nobleman declared himself my Lover.,, At first, I wculd i have passed it off with a Smile, but as he grew more Serious, I will own to you Serina, I treated it as the highest infuu upon my sense, to suppose I could listen, to one, who but the Day before, had in my Presence,, making the Same, Protestations to her Ladyship.

a greater Affront, ill Affairs of the Worlff^. than to doubt it; yet in their Dealings with Females, weak, and unable to protect themselves, and whose chief Reliance must often be upon this very Honour, Men break their Faith in the Face of Day, and deem the most isacred Vows in Love Affairs as meer.drifles, nay they boast of their Perjury; and even too often offer up their broken Faith to an old mistress, as the most grateful Sacrifice at. tlie.shrine of a new one..
Lord Clarey was nov dishoncerted at the Manner, in. which F received his Speech; but asi rose to retire, he intercepted me, and Suddenly caught me in his Arms. At that very instant entered Lady Sewel; at Sight of whom my new Lover quitted me,, and walked towards her, crying ‘ My dear Lady Sewel I ‘ • I am transported to See you : Let me ‘ perish if you do not look like an Angel vto dayr A Solemn Farce followed; the Nobleman pretending Innocence of what he knew was discovered, and the Lady affedfing Ignorance of what her Eyes had beheld.

Sewel. If I ashed your Advice,, it wa, s ‘ only to Sound your Affections: : find ‘ how they stand, and thank you for your ‘ salutary counsel.' I found her ladyship’s Mistake; but all my Endeavours to undeceive her proving ineffectual, I was about to retire, when she prevented me, crying, ‘ Stay, Child, one Word

Thus did this good Lady, by her Knowledge of the v/orld, render both. herself and me imhnppy. How often are the deepest laid Schemes overturned,, y and how often do they confound them — Selves! Believe me, my Serina, where any the least Confidence is necessary in human Assairs,. that once broken, it is in vain to steer by the exadest Card of Prudence : a.defe6f there always will be. — In short, Man was So formed by Nature for a Social Being, that Nothing but Such’ a mutual Trust can often be the Security

But Mr. Seymour, enraged at this unlucky Event, which occasioned his beloved Sister a long and dangerous sickness; could not endure the Sight of my Lover, and Sormally forbade him the house, and me he treated with a Sort of Sormal com plaisance. In Proportion as miss Sey moups Condition grew worse, .my lsf« became a Burden to me; I was, in my own Eyes, like one who sits lamenting, desolate, and Sorlorn, amidst the Ruins of her Country, or the Graves of her Friends: I beheld my protedors estranged, my Lover forbidden to approach me; and I dreaded every Day Some rafii Action from the latter, in consequence of that Prohibition. Lady Brooks, informed of my unhappy Situation, offered herseif as a Mediatrix with the angry Mr. mour, but in vain: By her Ladyship's Means, however, v/e had Some stolen Interviews; returning from one of which,
I was informed that miss Leonora desired to see me, her Brother being gone from Home...

Milner of C -- -- -- -- -- y; and the reason, as
I afterwards learned, was that he lay under a Iblemn Promise to his Sister not to part with me.
At last, one Morning, miss seymour Waiting maid came down, exclaiming with a terrible Cry, that her Lady was no where to be found; The Flouie and Gardens were Searched,, and Messengers dispatched to all Charters, to inquire after her, but in vain; Meanwhile, that Lady's Brotherj of whose violent Temper I had seen many Instances, raved like a Madman, vowing Vengeance on me and my Lover.

Lady Brooks Said everything that Friendship could Suggest to calm my troubled Spirits, and we both Set Sorward to find out miss Sedley. Being arrived at a inean house, on our inquiring for her, we were conduced into a Two pair of Stairs Back room, where over a Mor sei of Fire, Sat a pretty young Girl with a Child in her Arms. Misfortune and 'misery, Care and Penury, Seemed to have been long the Inhabitants of this wretched Mansion. The bright Eyes of Marick. iippeared quenched in Tears, and her bosom heaved with bursting Sighs., On. our Entrance, she arose to receive us, with Such an Air as, notwithstanding her present Appearance, miserable almost beyond Description, shevred she had been edu -- ^ucated in genteeler Life..
Her Ladyship aiked this young Crea hire many (^estions relative to the Cause f Jier .'tilisfortunes, to all which fiie replied

Many Circumstances appeared to corroborate her Story, and I no longer had any Doubt concerning the Perstdy of my Lover. I turned pale, my Tongue faul tered, and my. trembling Knees Scarce Sustained me. In this Condition, Lady Brooks and her Attendants conveyed me to the Coach, in. which I returned, rather !ad than alive.

Share in establishing that Prejudice, were lost to me. Relations I had none who, deserved the Name; and as to my Friends,
I Seemed born but to involve them in Perplexities. Thus circumstanced, I dedicated all my Hours to Sorrow; I lay down each Night In Anguish, and arose in the Mori., ing to a Renewal of gries.
‘ How lon g (would I often - exclaim), ‘ must • I be thus tossed on the troubled ‘ Sea of Life and exposed to the rude ‘ Blasts of Affliction. Surely for -- me there ‘ is no Rest, no Abiding plac6.

‘ I will try, at least, whether Misfortune ‘ will yet stretch her dusky Pinions, 'and ‘ pursue an unhappy Fugitive, to the ‘ remotest Corners of the World.
Thus complained I, and thus argued with myselfi Seeking by a Change of Place, to chase away that Anguish which was the Inmate of my bpsom; aiad thus the Wretched, ever seeking by altering their Situation, to alleviate their Sorrows, are doomed to prove Variety of jvoe.

The long wished for Time being at last arrived, and all Things got in readiness, the Captain hastened us on board, whither Mr. Milner would also accompany me, nor parted from us, till after the Ship was. under Way.

We had on board a Female Passenger
of the Name of L --, who being a Perr
Son of Small Fortune, was Sent for over, by a rich Uncle of hers, to live with him in India. This Lady was often the Companion of my melancholy Hours, and her agreeable sprightliness used to divert me. Though young, she was a person f sound Judgement as well as good sense; had • not only a ready Wit, but also the Art of restraining those more immoderate sal lies of it, which are So often prejudicial. She was Sweet tempered and agreeable. As for her Person, she was tall, and rather' inclinable to be thin, but extremely well shaped. Her Hair was of a glossy brown, her Eyes hazel, her Eyebrows rather dark and high atehed, her Features Soft and delicate, her Complexion 'was fair to a Fault, her bosom Snowy white, her Skin Smooth and clear, and though she could not be termed a persedt Beauty, she was at the least a very agreeable Lady.

She communicated her Story to me in ^ Confidence. She Said she was the Daughter of a rich Merchant, who was envied by many for his large Dealings, and great

success in Trade, which however tempted him atdast to' his Rum; for being remarkable in his good Fortune in all his ijndertakings, he resolved never again to insure any Ship or Cargo. He had at one Time, a great Concern embarked on board Some Vessels which were returning, richly Sreighted from the Indies. Before they arrived a War broke out, yet he could not be persuaded to insure; they were taken, and he lost all he had on board, together with his Share of the Ships, of which likewise, he was Part owner.
‘ Notwithstanding this loss, (continu
* the young Lady) and though my ‘ Father was So much injured in his Stock,
‘ that he was obliged for Some Time to
stop Payment, yet was he So infatuated, ‘ that he would not insure two other Slips, ‘ which he had in the Lijhon Trade. He ‘ exulted greatly when he heard one of
* them had been Spoken with at Sea, ‘ within a few Days Sail of the Lizard; ‘ but his Joy was Soon turned into Mourn ‘ ing, when the next nev/s he hdard was,
* that she wws wrecked on the Rocks of Scilly. With her, andher unhappy Crew, perished the Hopes of my Father, who

‘ Such complicated Misfortunes, fob ‘ lowing Such an uninterrupted Series of ‘ success, had So deep an effed on my ‘ Father, that hefickened and died, leav ‘ ing me to the Care of my Mother,
* who Supported herself and me, on a ‘ little paternal Inheritance of Sixty Pounds ‘ a Year, having given up her Jointure ‘ from a Principle of Honesty to the ‘ Creditors.

‘ We Soon found ourselves deserted by
* many of those Friends who had baulked
* in the Sunshine of prosperity and my ‘ Mother, willing to withdraw frona
Noise and Hurry, and from the Know ‘ ledge of Such false Friends, retired in ‘ to Kent, where 1 lived with her a reciufe ‘ and Solitary Life. But here it chanced ‘ Lotd Clarey, Son to the Lady grenjiue^ fixed his Eyes up >n me, and had Address

At last, proposing to ‘ take me with a Lady of his Acquaint ‘ ance, on a Party of pleasure, he be ‘ trayed his wicked Designs, being warm ‘ with Wine, by making, when he had ‘ got me alone, a vile Attempt upon my ‘ Honour, but Company coming up, I ‘ escaped his devilish purpose. However,
‘ his Credit was Such, that Sailing in his
S ‘ Designs upon my Chastity, he has ‘ blasted my charader in the Country,
‘ and it is from that, as miuch as any ^ cause, that I leave England.’
I was not amazed after what I had experienced, to hear of Lord cdr<^’s base nefs to this young Innocent. I. recited in Return, my Adventures, and gave her to understand what Share that Nobleman had in my Misfortunes. We were, in Some respeds, Sisters in Calamity, and this endeared us the more to each other.
As to the Officers, though they were good-natured and Social, the chief

Mate was the only one, who was by any mean’s fit for our Society. He had all that tenderness which was requisite to recommend him to a Woman, joined to the most intrepid Spirit, and dauntless Courage.

This Gonfiderate Generbfity, So uncommon in his Sex, recommended Mr. Drew (that was his Name) greatly to our es teem. It was natural Sorus to draw a Comparison, much to his Advantage, between this noble frankness of his, and the mean Arts of those vain Flutterers, who take a Delight to insinuate themselves into a female’s Affedfions, and then leave ' her to sigh in Disappointment. these Idlers will, at least, debauch a woman’s affedsions, is they should not her person, and enjoy in themselves the diabolical Satisfaction of giving Pain.

In this Extremity, Mr Drew, who was a Person of, the greatest Humanity,, himself visited the Sick; and having studied Somewhat of Physic, rendered himself very useful in. preserving, and restoring Health to' the Sailors.^ Every Lougue blessed, him, and his. generous Heart received that Secret Pleafureyeafier felt than described, that satis^^ion whichu transcends Description, the Testishohy’' of qonscious Virtue.

Contrary to the Customs of our w§stern World, she Gentlemen of the Military, are the least forward on tstese Occasions; and indeed in the more weighty Concern of Matrimony, they observe a similar gondua unwilling to espouse Persons as much on the List of Preferment as themselves: : to Speak ingenuoussy, the Ladies adppt the Same Principles of Action, and are not near do, fond of Scarlet, as they are in Ruro'pe...

Among the many Visitors whofrequent cd our house, there was a! young Merchant of the Name of Fenton, who (as. the major’s Lady often used to say) appeared to be in Love. She was not wrong in her conjedure; for, in a short Time,, this Gentleman publicly avowed a Paffibn ' for me, which most People eitpedsed i should be glad to cherish j as he was rich, ’ and ipossessed bessdes many personal Accomplishments, Such as might Seem worthy of the Regastd of any Woman,. wshose Affedfions were not engaged.

Mr. Fenton did not think my answer by any Means fussicient, and continued his Addresses, which I now began to look upon as mere Matter of Form, and, in consequence, treated with, a Sort of Rate lery, which I afterwards repented. Not able to find the real cause of my refu lal, his Fancy conjured up an imaginary one; So industrious are Some People to torment themselves. — He had noticed the frequent Visits of Mr. Drew at our house,. and being ignorant of his Passion for miss L— —, them to me, and fixed on him for a Rival.
Possessed with this false Notion, he one Day took upon him to wait on, that Officer, and demand, whether fie paid his Addresses to me? Ishough muck Surprised, and in Some Degree offended at

Aster the Marriage was Solemnized’ the Ship being under Sailing orders, w® were as expeditious as ppliible, in pro" viding all Istings for our Return to England, which I was now as desirous to revisit, as I had before been, impatient to quit.
f
But I suppose 3^0u will now exped Some Description of Bombay : That, stridfiy; Speaking,, 'my Dear, is the Province of History; yet, for yoursatisfadiion, I wdll. endeavour yo draw, a Small Sketch of, it.
The Istand of Bombay is In itself almost a mere Rock, and its chief use to the Company is its. Serving as a Magazine for all India.its natural Produce will nor ’■ Subsist its own proper inhabitants for Six Months in'the Year,, and it abounds in.. Nothing .but .venomous Animals. Yet this Istand,, not. Thirty Miles in Circumference is well enough peopled, and is a great Mart for Goods, with which it is Supplied ftom Ferjia, China, and the oppostte Coast: And in this the Black Merchants, find their Account, as they, vend all their Commodities at very higte Rates.

Isle Air of Bombay, since the Drainr. ih’g of the Mar files, is not unwholesome, though the Soil is i barren, and Europeatu^ may enjoy a good State of Health there provided they live temperately, and do not expose themselves too much to the Land -- Winds, which blow at certain seasons
from the opposite Shpre.
- * '■ ■ r
The monsoons begim here generally in the month of 7l<dy, with exceshve Rains; these cease in September, for a -- bout six Weeks, when they return with great Violence forra few Days; and the Whole breaks up with a terrible ishun der storm, called the Elephanta, after which there is a Certainty of Serene and settled Weather
’r'
Bombay is ruled by a Governor and Council, in whom is vested the Power of deciding all causes, and judging in Cafes of Life and Death. 1 he Military is under the Command of an Officer who, with the Title and the Rank only of Major,
adfs as a Lieutenant General. There

The Inhabitants are Such as re

thither from almost' all. Parts of the Eastern, World;. They are generally of, an .olive Gornplexion, with long black Hair; their Women are. mostly disagreeable. Some few of the Armenians excepted. As to the Habits of the People, their Religion, Manners, - and Customs, and even their Stature; all these are as different as the various Countries whence they draw their Origin; but all are fubjefest to the Civil Law of England hj which the’. Istaiid is governed. -,
, i *

Here, as in most hot Countries,, everything tends to Luxury; black Servants' and Slaves are to be hsd at a very easy Rate': To Say Trutiv. great Numbers of ' them are employeclto'do little, and it is not uncommon. to see an hidia ny'who boasts that he is nobly descended, ciseitiis -- Service to attend an ew^/z/h Officer.

, in the Chtnefe Manner, and is carried on the Shoulders of, four Men. — The Number of Europeafis at one Time on this if. land, seldom amounts to Six Hundred,, and that of the white Women, rarely exceeds Thirty.
It may not, be amiss to notice that Bombay was.a Part of the Dowry of' Queen Catharine, as the neighbouring lile of Salfetd was also to hxaye been; but' the Portuguese were inno Haste to fulfil' their Engagement, and the Indians, Some Time after, put it out of their Power to do it, by Seizing the latter for themselves,

And nowq my Senna, we may well stop, and pause, ere we proceed, giving fbme Time to Reffexion on the before we look forward to the future.

^ whose Beauty and address he extolled to the Skies, and amongst many other Pieces of her Art, related this Story,
‘ adding, that she had, powersul support ers. But Soon as they arrived, the pretended miss Sedley, at Sight of la dy brooks’s Livery, cried out she was betrayed, and feu into Fits.
/
‘ The Butler, who was'no Stranger to ' all that had pasted with Regard to me,
‘ Secured her, and Sent for me and his ^ Lady. “We came, and now by Threats, got the whole Secret from her.
'* In effeds, it appeared she was origl ‘ nally a reputable wholesale .dealef’s ‘ Daughter in the Country, who had ‘ been Seduced first, and then abandoned by Lord Clarey, and thatnobleman,
‘ who always hated me, and had besides' ' ‘ Reashns to wish to prevent otir '* Union, (since if I die childless, a Part of the Estate of our Family reverts to his,
‘ which is allied to us,) had urged her,
^ and instruded her how to Support this
‘ Charadfec,
rjc.42 The .D A I T K F U L
charader, for which She was to bo handsomely rewarded.
‘ As for the Child ‘ we saw, that was * her own, and her present miserable ‘ Condition, was less Seigned than real.
‘ Change but the Name of her Seducer ‘' from mine to his lordship’s, and the ‘ Tale was true, even - to the very Cir ’ cumstance of ■ the Marriage contrad;
‘ no Wonder then, llie So well adsed her Part. Necessity was all her excuse;
‘ • had she proceeded otherwise, she must ‘ shave perished.
'‘ Though she had'tobbed me of what ‘ I most valued in the World, yet her dis ^ ‘ tressed Condition rendered her an Ob -- ‘jedf rather of Pity than of Revenge.
‘ As for Lord Clarey, well I knew the ■ ‘ 'Villain would abandon sher, ' now his ‘ Scheme was discovered, and Ieave her ‘ to perish for Want; Therefore, when ‘ ray first Gust of Passion was over, {in '■‘•jured; as Lwas) I relieved her present Necessities, and resolved to wreak my ' ‘ Vengeance on her base Employer; but ‘ of this no Opportunity presented itself ‘ during my Stay in Eiigland.

‘ There was an Officer on; ” board,

that 1 was embarked in.

When We put in at the Cape, he ^ came on Shore with me. As we under ‘ stood the Captain would not Sail for four ‘ Days, we disposed of ourselves accord a ingly; rambling a great Way up the ^ Country, and; pleasing ourselves with the beautiful and romantic prospedfs.
‘ But while we were thus diverting ‘ ourselves, on the Night of the Second Day, the Captain weighed Anchor,

Thus concluded my Lover, with an agreeable Presage of future happiness, which now fully posseffed his Soul.

The Seamen hailed with Shouts of Joy their native Shore; Echo returned the Sound, and the pleased Ocean Smoothed his Waves, attentive to the Notes.

In the mean Time, we Saw one another frequently, or more properly speaking, we were almost perpetually together,

There was now no longer any Obstacle to our happiness, and we imagined we vere at the End of our Trouble; but we had one Severe Trial to experience. Sure never any one purchased llappinefs (if 1 may be allowed the expression) at So dear a rate as your Friend.

A Month elapsed, and no Tidings could be got of him; when Captain Drew entered one Day with a Sorrowful Countenance, and calling aside Mrs. Milner, who was with me, whispered Something with which that good Lady Seemed to be greatly affeded.

: I afterwards heard that Captain Dmti chad met with the Master of a Vessel on the Exchange.,, who declared he had Seen the Cutter in which Mr. Lovell had embarked, stdunder in a. Severe Gale of Wind, and added, that every one on shoard perished.

He whom I deemed happy was Suffering the extremest Torments. His lord fiiip was (as I have besore observed) a person of Learning; and in his cooler Hours, when over satigued with noise, Riot, and Debauchery, he Sometimes attended to the Study of Physic and natural Fhilofbphy.
That Nobleman entertained himself with' many curious Researches;; among the Rest (being of a cruel Temper) took Delight in trying Experiments with poisonous Drugs upon Dogs and other Animals. His Study was Sull of this Sort of Preparations, and being well acquainted with their Nature and effeds, and Suffering no one else, to meddle with them, he was never apprehensive of any mischief from them.
^ •
N
But his Lordship one Day since his Recovery, had brought one of these Phials of poison, on Account of Some Experiment, out of his Study,. and carelessly left it on his Dressine table. Near it
o
stood a strengthening Draught, prescribed him to restore his Vigour, which had
been

'been much impaired by his long and dangerous iliness.
%
Coming down one Morning in a Hurry, just as he was going out, Tecoilediing that he had not taken his Draught, he Sent his Servant in great Haste for' the Bottle which stood on his Dreffingrl'able, forgetting that there were two., The Man returned With that which stood near^ est Hand, and was indeed the only one that met his View, the other being hid by the glass; and this was the poison. Ihe Peer swa41ow*ed it down in his Hurry, without distinguifiiing it by the Taste, as his Physic was far from beirig palatable.

Life of Torment. His End was now approaching, and he who had ever affecsted to be a despiser of the Precepts of Heaven, now felt it terrible in its Judgments.
Nor were his Torments confined to his Body alone — miserable as he was, his Mind Suffered likewise. That good Sense and Learning, those shining Talents
which he had abused, now rose, as it
\ ^ ^ ^
were, in Judgement against him.
- ilemorse, and the bitterness of Sorrow, preyed on his Soul: His Rapes, his criminal Excesses, (Tor in the pursuit of his pleasures, he had been guilty of many) appeared now in the most horrid Colours. Weary of Life, yet fearing the Hour rhat drew on his Dissolution, he might be Said to experience a Hell upon Earth.

that Time both busted in administering their friendly consolations, offered to accompany me.
Thus escorted, I went, and Sound indeed a woesul Scene. Stretched on his Couch, and in heart distrading Anguish, lay the once So Spirited, So gay, So fierce Lord Clarey.
At Some Times, he Sunk in a deep Melancholy. At others, his Eyes rollect wildly, and a Kind of Frenzy Seized hi in, which Seemed wholly to poffess his tortured and despairirig Soul.
When I approached his Lordship, ' fixing his Eyes upon me, and railing hirnself, in a Speech, interrupted with frequent Groans, he thus addressed me,
‘ I Sent for ymu, miss ivf -- -- to be

The next Morteiilg stye were informed that his Lordship had expired, in the ex tremest Agonies of Body and Mind. His Fortune descended to a near Relation of Mr. lovelps. ^
As for his Mother, the pious Lady Greville, she lived not to See this her son’s unhappy End; the stienttomb had long fiiice received, and Spared her the Heartbreaking of Such a Sight.
The Peer had long gone on in a course of Wickedness and Debauchery: Our helpless Sex had been his constant Prey, and he had made a pradice of ruining those wshofe too easy Faith led them to hearken to his insidious Addresses, and then abandoning them to Shame and
Misery.

* His person, his address, and his Station in lise, were all made by him Sub servient to his vile Schemes, in the prose cutiori of which he stopped at Nothing. He was besides of a bold and desperate Spirit, fierce, haughty, and overbearing, and ever ready to Support one bad Action by another; yet, wdth all these ill Qualities, he knew but too well how to insinuate himsels into the Affebdions of

the weak and unguarded.

What a narrow escape had I, Serimy
from his lordship’s house !-1 owed it,
as I afterwards learned, to the Fright of his Country Footboy, whose Concern for his master’s Life, which he fupposed to be in Danger, was So great, that he Scarcely knew wfat he did, and, in die Midst of his Confusion, left a Candle burning under a Shelf, that caught Fire, and Set the House in a Flame, which was much damaged, and with Difficulty Saved from being entirely consumed.

After teat lady’s Death, this her Sons who became possessed. of her Jointure? grew more abandoned than before, and was absolutely engaged in a Design upon a young Lady of Small Fortune, when his Adventure with the Son of Sir James put a Stop to his course, and the fatal Mistake already mentioned, put an End to
fiis Life.

It is a melancholy Reflection, Serinay. that many young Heirs of illustrious Families Seem to copy the Character of Lord Clarey; yet it is no less melancholy than, true. Many whose high Station in Life ought to Set them as Ihining Patterns of Virtue to their Inferiors, Spend their Youth in, a Round of Riot and Debauchery,

LETTER XII

s
Epistle, my dear Serim, ^ rp ^ will conclude the Story of my
unhappy Adventures; for un happy they were, ^ till the Period in which you became acquainted with, me : Since that Time I have indeed had. no reason to repine. Heaven, which ordained that I should experience the rudest Shocks of astlidion, was pleased at lash to condush me to as happy a State as I cm hope to enjoy on this Side of the: Grave.
ft
Believe me, my Friend, perfefi fek city, is but an imaginary Being, which, those w: hoseekxon Earth, must, ever re

turn from the pursuit of, empty and disappointed.
But the State nearest allied to pure happiness, is that of him who is blessed ' with Content. I mean not here to moralise with those philosophers, who being gs Opinion that be who had the fewest Wants was happiest, threw away, for that reason, the real Necessaries of Life. All I would be understood to inculcate, is, That he who is blessed with Health, and enjoys the Society of his Friends in a State above Want, and yet complains he is unhappy, will still remain So, though he should exchange his Competency for all the Riches and Honours the World could bestow.
Here I would observe,. That if Opinion be not the Sole constituent Principle and true Standard of happiness, it is yet one of the most necessary Ingredients in it : And if one who in a miserable Situation tinnks himself happy, cannot strid ly Speaking) be accounted So; He has at least greatly the Advantage of him, who
though

  207
though possessed of every other Blessing, Wants that Opinion.
But to leave this Digression— — had now given over all Thoughts of ever Seeing my Lover again, and had resigned mysels as well as I was able to my Fate, counting the tedious Hours asso many Obstacles in my Way to the Harbour of' Peace.
All pleasures • became tastelefs, and every Blessing us lise with me had lost its Charms: All seasons w’ere to me alike; In vain for me were Scattered the blooming Flowers of Spring; the purple Stores of Autumn were lavished in vain upon me. Summer and Winter, Day and Night, were equally tedious; So true it is that every Scene and Situation in Life, each external objed, takes its Tincture from the Frame of our Minds, and pleases or displeases but as they are af ledsed.
Whilst I was thus wasting my Time in Sorrow, Word was one Day brought me, that a Gentleman, desired to See me who
had

Letters for me from abroad. When I went down, I Sound a ferson dressed like a Foreigner, and closely: muffled up, who delivered a Pacquet into my Hands, without uttering a Word,.

Whilst; I was intent upon examining; its Contents, the: Bearer Suddenly threw off his Cloak, and presented to my astonished View my Lovell, whom I had supposed to be long since numbered with; the Dead.,

The Surprise mas too powerful for my weak Frame to bear : .r -- I Screamed out,
^ and fainted away. He ran to my Sup -- port, and raised me in his Arms, while Mr. and Mrs. Milner, Sir. George and his Lady,, who were all within at that Time,., came and joined us.. They were greatly astonished to.fee Mr.xovr//, and heartily congratulated him, while they were in Pain .for my Situation, and used all them Endeavours for my Recovery.

contrary Passions- -- was indeed a
tender Scene : and our good Friends rejoiced in our Happinest.
In a short Space of I'ime, my Wonder was increased by Seeing Captain Stanley andshis Lady alsbenter : They Seemed to have an Idea of all that had passed, and expressed no Surprise at the Sight of Mr. lqvell Safe and in englanl
When the Raptures ocoafioned by this unexpeded Meeting were Subfid'ed a little, I began to be dessrous of learning from the Mouth of my Lover the Particulars of his Preservation, and what had befallen him since our last Separation, which, in Compliance with my Request, he thus related.

‘ Blood rose with Anger at Sight of him,
‘ as I had long before determined to call ‘ him to an Account for his villainous ‘ Behaviour to one whom I held So dear,
‘ and his base Scheme to prevent our ‘ Nuptials : But not deeming this a pro
* Place for it, I checked my Re
‘ fentment, and did not Seem to regard ‘ him.
‘yet no Sooner was I Seated, than *, his Lordship endeavoured to render me ‘ the Ridicule of the Company; and ‘ even this I bore for Some Time, and ' treated with fiient Contempt, as not ■ ‘ willing to engage myself in a Duel on ‘ the Eve of our Nuptials.
‘ At last, as it was ever his Custom ‘ to asperse the charaders of those he ‘ coiild not Seduce, he had the insolence ‘ to call your Virtue publicly in ques ‘ tion. ' I could no longer refrain, but

‘ riling, threw a Glast of Wine in his ‘ Face, bestowing on him the Title of ‘ Villain, which he So justly deserved,
We drew on the Instant, but, as in

* his Lordship took Occasion to walk

and a short but Smart Encounter en ‘ Sued, in which I received a slight
* Wound, and the Peer fell.

® But the Company fbon after missing ‘ us, and suspedhng our Design, followed ‘ us. Among them was an Acquaintance ‘ of mine, of the Name of Horton, who ‘ perceiving what had happened, urged ‘ me to be gone : This very Even“
“(Said he) I shall Set out for do ver; I conjure you to go with me till “you see the Issue of this unfortunate ‘‘ Affair.’’ I would have staid, at all ‘ Hazards, but was prevailed on, for the ‘ Sake of my Lerefa, to use every Me ‘ thod of preserving my Life.

‘ On our Arrival at Dover, the Wind ‘ was So violent, and the Seas ran So • ‘ high, that it was with Difficulty we

  S. 213
‘ providentially taken up by a Portuguese ‘ Vestel bound for Lijhori, where I vas
‘ engaged in an odd Affair. •.
%
/
^ Being arrived, I was entertained at
* the hcuse of Captain Stanley. Among ‘ the many Visitors who frequented his ® house, was a young Lady of high ^ Birth and great personal accomplish ‘ ments, and who would indeed have ‘ been the Admiration of all who knew ‘ her, but for her haughty Spirit, which ‘ more than counterbalanced all her ‘ Charms.
‘ Unhappily for, me, it fell out that ‘ this Lady regarded me with the Eyes
* of Love, and was not a little piqued,
‘ wshen she observed that I did not notice ‘ Several Advances which She made me.
“At last, happening one Day to be left ‘ alone with me, she entered into a Con ‘ versation on the subjed of Love and ‘ Marriage, in the course of which file ‘ was indeed So explicit, that I could no ^ longer even affedi to mifunderstand ^ her.
‘ Perplexed as I was, I knew not how ^ to answer. I need not repeat to my
Tereja,
t
r
214
* Irerdfa, that my a'ffedions were dis posed of; yet, knowing her Temper,
‘ I chose not to treat with apparent dis ‘ dain one of So violent a Spirit; nor ‘ could I wiili to give Pain to one whose ' Misfortune., and not her Crime, it was to have entertained So fruitless a Passion
* me.
‘ I took a middle Course; I acknow~
‘ lodged myself, in gerieralaerms, high' ‘ ly honoured by her Regard, and those ^ of her Esteem, which my Cir ‘ cumstances would however by no Means ‘ capacitate me to return.
‘ This resped, as I have since found,
‘ she misconstrued into Love, .and .after Some very oblip ine; Speeches, withdrew ‘ for that Time.
‘ I afterwards wished I had enlarged ® more in my answer: For meeting one ‘ Day with this lady’s Uncle, Don Al
‘ varez, on the public Walks, he enter
* into a long discourfe with me, in which he talked much concerning a
‘ Match
\
 215
‘ Match between me and his Niece,
* which he Seemed to confider as a Thing ‘ Settled, at the Sanne Time giving me ‘ to understand, he thought Donna Isabella ‘ Sar above my Rank: He Said, That as ‘ Things had proceeded So Sar betweerx ‘ us, he was willing however his consent ‘ should not be wanting; adding, that he ‘ hoped I would however abjure my He
‘ relies, and become a good Catholic.
%
‘ It is easy to judge how much this ^ discourse Surprised me : I hastened to ‘ undeceive the Don, who could Scarcely ‘ believe me sincere in my Declaration,
‘ and told me he took it ill that I should
‘ endeavour to hide from him what was
♦
known to all Lijhon beside. But when ‘ I perfisted in my Denials, he grew Southeast ‘ rious, and at last downright angry:
“Could you pitch (laid he) on none in Portugal besides the Niece of Don “Aharez, to make your Sport of?
“But think not this Injury shall pass un punished.’^ It was in vain I endea ‘ voured to make this Nobleman Sensible ^ I had never So much as pretended ^ a Pashon for Donna Isabella he threatened
t
/
\
I
216
‘ tened Revenge, and left me, heartily ^ vexed at the Adventure.
I communicated this Affair to Cap ® tain Stanley; — he gave me to under ® stand that I had everything to fear ‘ from the resentment of Don Alvarez
‘ who was a very powerful Man, and ^ one that was remarkably jealous of the ‘ Honour of his Family, as well as re -- vengeful to the last, where he only ‘ Supposed it injured,
‘ During this Time, I had written Let ‘ ters to you and to my Father, containing an Account of my Situation, which *
* were coniimitted to, the Charge of a Sea ‘ Captain of my friend’s Acquaintance,
^ whose Vessel waited but a favouring
* Wind to Sail for England.
^ Soon after, I received a Note from ^ an unknown Hand, importing that a ' Gentleman waited for me on one of ^ the Walks. When I came thither, I ‘ found a Youth, whom I never remembered to have Seen before. Upon ^ inquiring his business“ “have the
Honour
•i  ai
the Honour (Said he) to be Son to Don Alvarez, and Cousin to Donna Isabella, whom you have grossly injured. If you “are a Cavalier of Spirit, this will be ‘‘ Information Sufficient. Thus I revenge her...........he Seconded his Words
* with his Sword, and pushed at me ib ^ briskly, that I, found it was no Time to ' parley, and returning his Courtesy, af ‘ ter exchanging Some Passes, "it was my ‘ Fortune to wound him. On the Instant he fell, J was' Secured by foins ‘ People, whom our Rencounter (being
'C fuo public) had drawn to us. An AK ‘ gui%ile presently attended, and I was conduced to prison,
Thus what in one Country I had ‘ strove to avoid, I met with in another;;
‘ little know w e how to shun our ^ Fate.
&
I
^ During this Time, a Priest (whom I
* afterwards found to be the Gonfessarius • ‘ of Isabella) came to visit me, and en
'■* as much as possible, to draw me into religious discourse, under thc/

As to Mlh Aln^; though she has; had many Offers, she has (prudently, in, my Opinion) rejeded them all, justly eoncluding,, that those who address her,., after the Injury she lias Idstaiaed, must make their Court rather, to her Fortinm. than her Person ■

Have you heard, Senna, the Story cs the Marriage of my uncouth Lover, and intended Ravisher, Cleyton f As there is Something odd in she Circumstances of the Affair, I will repeat it Lor your Entertainment.
He paid his Addresses for Some Time to a Widow who was reported to be very rich, whose consent at last he gained to a Match, of which he appeared very de ssrous. Yet had not either of them the least Regard for the person of the other, nor could the Figure of Cleyton be fup posed to command any : His Wife, although far from disagreeable in her per fen, was extremeh'^ So in her Temper,.

This was occafibned by a forged Note,, which Mrs. Ckytoti had pasted, and which was given her by the young Officer I mentioned.
