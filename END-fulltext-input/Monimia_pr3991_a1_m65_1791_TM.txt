Indulge thyself, Gregory, laugh as much as thou wilt now — Soon shalt thou be Sorced to look grave; for aster thou hast taken orders, and turned, O woeful day! thy tail into an humble curl, thy risible Saculties must not be indulged. Confider well, friend, ere thou renouncest
THE POMPS AND VANITIES
of this WICKED WORLD — come, and .place thyself only one month under my tuition, and I will give thee leave to post me up for an ass, if 1 do not make thee give up thy intended plan.
You See by the date of my epistle that I have left Luihington Park to mourn the absence of its master, and am in the centre of pleasure and happiness. Now, Gregory, for all thy formal looks and demure afpeb, thou enviest me, I know. Youth, health, Spirits, and last, not least, three thou Sand pou nds a year — Egad, these are qualifications might tempt an anchorite to envy me..

you are arrived at it, (you may then See

your danger) you must inevitably Sail, For the better elucidation of my advice, I will consider you as pursuing two dis serent ends.
In the first place, I will follow you through the path of pleasure — with a heart beating high with expesfation — a constitution unimpaired — lord of a noble, unincumbered estate, you Set out.

Let' me now consider you as taking: the other road, the road of reason. The first steps on this path, though not produslive of Such rapture, afford that gentle pleasure which increases as you advance onward, and the grows more and more delightsul in proportion as you view it nearer out consumjng your estate, the poor are relieved through your means; the indus trious are Supported; you are able, by

be willing to dispense with.
My father was the only Son of a
gentleman, who from being too much
concerned in the rebellion lost an immense
estate. The total ruin of the
cause he had espoufed, and of his property,
broke his heart. On his deathbed
he was touched with remorse for the
part he had taken against his Sovereign,
and calling his Son, then about twenty
years of age, to his bedside, entreated
him, with the wreck of what was left,
to purchase a commission, and by fighting
in defence of his country, to make
Some atonement for the offences of his
father. The fon adhered stristly to the
entreaties of his parent, and coliesting

In Several expeditions he gained applause,
and by degrees was promoted to
the rank of captain. The colonel of

man, with more warmth than prudence.

but previous to the duel, as he knew
whatever were the consequences he could

no longer remain in the regiment, he Sold his commission. The colonel Suffered
for his imprudence; he was left mortally
wounded on the field, and my father,
with all his effects, was forced to
ssiip himself for America. On their
passage, an Algerine ship attacked them.

At his departure from England, he had taken the precaution to > convert his effesis into bills of exchange upon America : these he.concealed about: his person in Such a manner, as to escape the Search of his captors.

It was on Such an evening, in an arbour at the bottom of the garden, my father sat, his imagination fondly wandering to Scenes of pleasure past. In; the midst of his contemplations Some: plaintive notes broke upon his ear, and; listening attentively, a Soft voice Sun the folk)v/ing words

It is impossible to Sorm an idea what

a youth kneeling on the ground.

A rustling among the
trees made him break off in the middle of his address, and turning round to See what oceafioned it, be beheld my Sather, who advancing to him, requested, his pardon for listening, but that hearing the language of his country, a natural impulse of curiosity led him to the Spot whence the Sound proceeded, where observing one in that awful attitude, interruption he thought would be impertinence. The youth eastly pardoned him; and thefimiliiude of their circumstances naturally producing an intimacy, he discovered that the youth belonged to the Same master as himself, but being employed chiefly in the house, had been the reason of their never meeting be sore. My father now found the weight of stavery less oppressive. In the evenings the young gentleman would accompany him in his walks, and while my father played on the flute, would join

aster he had read it, the young gentleman inquired if he meant to keep the appointment? My father replied, that if he did go, it would Solely be with a view of benefiting his friend and liim sclf, and trying to effesl an escape from ssavery. The youth appeared in better Spirits; and it was agreed between them, that my father should not fail to keep the appointment. In the evening, therer fore, he repaired to the arbour, where much time had not elapsed before a female richly dressed joined him. After Some compliments, Stranger, ” Said she, in the French language, this, no doubt, Seems to you an extraordinary aslion of mine; you will excuse me, when you hear my story :
I was returning from the West-indies to my husband in France, when we were taken by an Algerine, and I was sold to your master. — Hitherto he has behaved with remarkable complaisance

“I have been told, there are in Algiers certain fellows who, for a good Sum will transport us to Some part where we may be Safe from the power of these barbarians. Are you ready to lend me
in
your assistance ?” — My father the affirmative. “Here are, then. Some jewels, take them and heaven prosper you.”
After having made an appointment at the Same place the next evening, the lady and my Sather parted. He was not dilatory in executing his commission; but sensible that caution was necessary, lie took care to Sound the Sentiments of those fellows whom the lady described to him before he trusted them with the extent of his commission. One he found, at length, who for the sake of a

he carried to the lady, and it was

time, the lady, the young gentleman.

they had not been long there, when a
boat rowed up to the shore, in which
they all embarked, and were carried to
the vessel, which immediately Set Sail.
After a fortnight’s voyage, they arrived
at

As it was my sather’s original intention
to steer his course to America;

In terms the most affesiing he would bemoan
his Situation, the big tear trickling

The melancholy death of my mother joined to the unwholesoracness of the prison, brought on my father an ague which would have deprived me of him, had not an exchange of prisoners re leased him from consmement. The length of time he had been in prison, and the ague, had deprived him of the Life of his left arm, So that he was unable to join again the forces of his native country. The war raged with the greatest violence : — we found that we could not live peaceably where we were, and therefore turned our thoughts towards our native country. And here, Matilda, are we arrived, friendless and forlorn, in hopes that the Ioffes my father has Sustained in his fortune, and the injury done to his health, will have weight with the ministry.

And now, Gregory, aster having informed
thee of these necessary preliminaries,
I will make a comparison between
thy Situation and mine, in order
to prove what a horrible dull fellow thou
art, and what a Spirited happy dog
I am.
In turning over pages of musty Greek
and Latin authors, thy mornings are
confuraed. At the sound of a great
bell, thou goest to dinner, and perchance
afterwards takest thy share of an humble
bottle of port. In dry conversation on
college discipline, dull tricks played on
the proslors, and bastards laid to thy
charge by antiquated bed makers, thou
employest thy moments till tea time, after
which, with a Solitary walk, as Solitary a
Supper, and a glass of punch, with a pipe
of tobacco, thy day ends. ‘‘ Oh, horrible!
MOST HORRIBLE!

NOUS, rather ungraceful; but it is the fashion, and so my mouth is stopped.
In order to give himself a moneyed look, I suppose, he wears a bob wig, which, however it may answer the purpose intended, does not appear to me to be stristly a-la-mode. — But he is a man of fortune, and therefore may plead privilege to be as ridiculous or outre as he pleases.
Give me leave to introduce, in the next place to your notice, Tim. Barton, esq. quite the reverse of the former gentleman in everything: — ssim, light, airy, with a wonderful deal of vivacity

CHARLES L U S H I N G T O N, Esq,
DEAR CHARLES,
ASK but five minutes Serious attention,
and Surely you are not So much
attached to your new acquaintance but
you may grant to an old friend So Small
a request. Satisfied of this, I will Say a
few, and but a few words.
What, Charles, what are you going
to do? — Whither are your passions about
to carry you? — To certain, inevitable
RUIN
Oh, Charles, and is every
Sentiment of virtue, every spark of emulation
thus extinguished? — Now, while
your country calls for your ashstance in
the
M O I M I A V
49
the field, or in the cabinet, are you deaf
to her necessities?? in the lascivious
lap of pleasure, are you wasting your
health, your time, your honour?
And who are these new friends?
Known to you Scarce a week. — From an
acquaintance only of this duration, are
you going to throw yourself entirelytin
der their proteqion, and Submit to be
guided by them to do that for which I
would fain think, your heart must condemn
you. — But go on — Advice, I fear.
will come too late. — Let experience
convince you I have told you the truth
though, perhaps, at the expense of
friendship. — Be ruined.
Add
ONE
MORE to the many who live despifed
instances of talents misused, and for
tunes misapplied.

and never beheld So lovely a creature.
You may be Sure much time

landlady. From her I learned not much.
She Says, the young lady and her Sather,
who is an officer, have lodged there
Some time; and that from the privacy
and the retirement in which they live,
she supposes they may be under Some
difficulties. Perhaps the world has used
them hardly, and they despise all communication
with it. Perhaps they are
reduced. in their circumstances, and
want even the necessaries of life — If
it be So, wshat a wretch am I, who am
thus idly lavishing away what would
make them happy!

ERHAPS it may be a matter of Surprise that a private individual, dare address you with any other than the most Submiffive resped.

to the Substance of this epistle, and will
recount again the purport of my former
remonstrances, in order that should ever
the affair be made public, you may not
be able, however you may wish, to deny
the fact.
On my first interview to you, I proved
that I dispofed of my estate at a very
great disadvantage, expended the produce,
Suffered a long imprisonment, and
much injury to rny health, for the Service
of my country; I therefore requested
Some compensation, with a full
expeslation of not being denied. — I
meant not a compensation for the Service
I may have rendered my country, be
eause the honour of having been able
to be of any Service to it, carries its reward
with it.
But that what my property had Suffered,
I judged (and cannot still think I

you have any claim to humanity or not.
It was not even this refusal that carried
with it So great a stingi as 'the insolent

HE rebuff I met with Swayed me
not from my purpose. — I resolved
on pursuit the first favourable opportunity.
— Last night, warm with the pro duce of the vine, I returned homej
the Soft tread of a female foot over my
head. Seemed to invite me, and I re
Solved to steal upstairs, and try if, Lo
thario like, I could prevail. It was past
midnight — the whole house was wrapped
m
M O N I M I A.
in Silence: I own I was rather ashamed
of what I was going to undertake, but
quickly recollebing myself, I stole with
gentle pace upstairs. The dim glimmering
of a candle direoed me to the
chamber — I opened the door and entered.
— The lovely girl was Sitting at i
%
table, her head sostly pressing one hand.
a white handkerchief in the other. — At
t
Sight of me she started up, and uttered
a Saint Scream. I flew to her, and
dropping on one knee, ‘ Fear not, my
‘ life, I Said, Oh! fear not. I come, believe
rile, not to do thee harm.’ I
then gently Seized her hand, and would
have imprinted a kiss on it, but she
drew it hastily away, and walked ma
jestically to a bed in the room.

If my
defenceless state Secures me not from
“insult, behold, ” and she drew aside
the curtains; I looked — and, gracious
God I Saw the corpse of a man laid on
It.

Still the object approached, and at length came up to the grave, where with a kind of anxious horror I waited for the event.
The night was So dark that I could not perceive whether the person was male or female, till the following words, uttered in a faint pathetic tone, convinced me.

to drop a carsual offering to the most common objesl of charity. When I should relieve, I can only pity, and lament what I cannot alleviate. In the course of plain country life, no adventures are likely to make me their heroine; but it is not improbable that my little chit-chat may beguile an hour of misery — the very thought becomes a luxury, to me. That my situation is irksome you cannot be ignorant of, but it is rather lightened by occasional visitants, who flutter round me, because they think me a fortune, and whifpcr nonfense which they call love. My guardian cares not wdao comes. So they intrude not, on his table, and as I find tea, he becomes delighted by an intercourse with strangers, and leaves me to ab as I please.

is man — how wondersully, how" artfully formed! and yet, though the construction is the Same, how different are the movements, the powers! — adver fity, prosperity, affesl not all in the Same manner. This young man vdiom I mentioned in my last, whose name I find is
Glanville, has left me without the least

I had observed a Settled melancholy on his countenance for Some time, and tried to divert it without being able to
Succeed..
#
This Soon afterwards changed into a levity bs behaviour, a wildness of look, which I took for the effesi of my endeavours to please him..
I was deceived — it was the prognostic of raadnefs; he left me some days ago, and I have not been able, with all my efforts, to find out whither he is wandering. — Well may I exclaim with Ophelia,
\
Oh! what a noble mind is here o’erthtown!
I shall make all the inquiries I can after him, in order to endeavour once more to recover him to reason, and yet, perhaps, by such a step, to a keener fense of niisery.
'Adieu.

We had loitered on, perhaps a couple of miles, for enchanting converse prevents fatigue, when we stopped at once, to enjoy the Situation of a cottage, more romantically gloomy than fan, cy itself could pisiure. Here, I exclaimed in a rapture, with just money enough to keep distress at a distance, and love enough to enjoy each other beyond Society, two fond hearts might be exquisitely blessed! — It Seemed the retreat for mutual affeshon, I donst know how, but the pislurefque appearance awed me into tears.

I made Some remark to Garcias in English
(for our conversation had been in
French besore) when the old man threw
Such a look at me, and burst into So
violent an agony that overpowered nature,
and gave my gratitude an opportunity
of returning that indulgence he
had So handsomely shown to me. He
opened his eyes, but to agonies still
greater, and to have lest him alone
would have been brutal. It was Some
hours besore he recovered, and it was become
too late for our return, we there
Sore threw' ourselves on the straw mattrass,
while he retired to a little room,
wdiere (as he told us his custom was) he
meant to dedicate the hours till morning
in Solemn prayer. Our curiosity was ex
cited — we courted and enjoyed a hasty
steep — and with the first stashes of the
morning he joined us. “You will wonder,
Madam, (addressing himself to me

with Something like composure) you will wonder, Madam, at those agitations age like mine could betray, without Sinking me into the grave. — Alas! that only happiness yet remains for me. — You are an Englishwoman, may the God of mercies bless you with all the joys, which the virtues, the tenderness, the truth, the innocence of Englishwomen entitle them to. But we do not always in a life like this, reap the fruit of our merits. — Oh! Sophia. — Would you hear the story of a woman who wanted none of them. — But do not curse me, I would have the prayers of all. — My story is not known here, but that you drew the same air in infancy with my Sophia, it Should be locked here still. — Here in my heart! — I will now relate it for the last time, and if possible complete it by my death.” — Here he looked, — Oh! my Mqnimia, it is impossible to describe
how! — =

how! — and aster a world of sighs, he
went on thus:
My Sophia was from a family of
distindion in England, remarkable for inflexibility of Sentiment, and a republican
pride, of which her father was an
early vidim; for in one of those tumultuous
moments. So frequent in that kingdom,
he flew to arms; his party was soon
defeated, and he was persecuted by the
court without being proteded by the nation.
— He was thrown into the common
prison, and died like a hero, in the
arms of his wife and daughter, conjuring
them not to disgrace themselves by Soliciting
his pardon. — After catching the
last Sighs of a fond father, Sophia, in
honour to his memory, vowed the deepest
hatred to that country, which, in his distress,
bad forsaken him, — Her Soul was
formed with equal faculties to love or
to abhor, with that noble energy with
which

i
M O N I M I A. 165
which every great mind is agitated. Her mother bore the Same Sentiments, and they both determined to leave a Soil, the very sight of which inflamed the memory of ingratitude. The remains of a scattered fortune, lessened by a long Series of disasters, was easily colleded; it was moderate, but Sufficient to shield them from the inclemencies of cold and hunger. Nor were they reduced to accept the chilling offers of assistance from dead friendship, or pretended benefactors, who are a Species of mental alsaf sins, that distribute gold with one hand, and dishonour with another. Rejedling resources they despised, and contented with what fate had left them, they came to reside in this neighbourhood, not far
'1*
from whence my regiment was in garrison. Accident, and a slight occasion of Service, brought me acquainted with them — acquaintance ripened into friendship

the door, and led me into the parlour;
on my entrance, an old gentleman, but
not Lord Blagrave, rose and bowed very
politely.
CC
You will keeip this Gentleman
company; I am obliged to go out
for a short time, — your most obedient.
Sir.’’ — I looked at her with a Supplicating
look, and Sat down. — Fresh insults,
thought I; what more am I to endure
! — Young lady, you look uneasy,
(Said the old gentleman,) in a voice full
of pity.” — Ah! Sir, have I not reason!”
— Indeed! may, I know? I may
be a friend.” — I looked up to him; his
comely grey locks, and a certain benignity
of countenance Seemed not formed
for deceit; * they inspired me with hope.
I rose, fell at his feet, and burst into
tears. — You can, indeed. Sir, be a
friend to me; and. Oh! Heaven knows
how much I want one !” — He raised me

Poor girl! and I will be thy friend; perhaps thou art not So far gone in guilt, but thou may’st refleq; on thy situation with horror!" — ‘‘oh! no, Sir!. I am not guilty indeed; I knew not what house this was; I was Seduced to it." And I told him in what manner, and what treatment I had experienced in it.
He heard me with attention; paused a moment; and then Said, “Child, you may rely on me; I came here on no bad purposes; you must dilsemble; you must appear cheerful, and tomorrow cxped me." — Mrs. allerton’s coming in prevented him from saying more. Conversation on different Subjects filled up the rest of the time the old gentleman staid, and at parting he gave me a look, which told, me I might depend.on him.,

I Sollowed his advice, appeared rather

chearsul, and Mrs. Allerton was deceived. — I was, you may be Sure, anxious for the coming of the next day. — Hope,
fear, joy and Sorrow, alternately took, possession of my heart.
The morning, at length, arrived, and about twelve o’clock I Saw a coach stop,, and from which the old gentleman alighted and came in. He chattered with Mrs. Allerton and myself for about five minutes, and then pretending to have forgot Something, hurried out of the room to the coach,, and returned, bringing with him two other gentlemen; I guessed the cause. — ” Give me leave, Mrs. Allerton, to introduce my friends.’' She did not susped anything, and received them courteoussy. — After about a quarter of an hour’s stay, they arose to depart: ‘‘ Come, Madam, are you ready to go ?” Said my deliverer to me.

Upon hearing my intention of treading the paths of literature, he offered to introduce me to a club of authors, who met every week at a house in fetter lane : being totally disengaged, I agreed to accompany him there. — My little
editor, I Sound, was a man of some con

A great coat, big enough for two, encircled his body, and was kept buttoned with particular care; which in the course of the evening he told us, was a very excellent pro tedion, against cold, to which he was very fubjesl; for the same reason, I conjeslure, that he chose to Surround his

The president boasted, with much pomposity, of a manuscript Sent him by a nobleman, to peruse, “but d — n his Lordship, Said he, I cannot read it, it is So vilely written.”
The deputy pressdent talked much of a constitutional Song he had written, which was received with the greatest applause,

The presidenss hammer coming in contad with the table, with much violence, stopped the mouths of every one: An universal silence reigned. — I wondered what was the reason of it.
The president soon put an end to my astonishment: “Gentlemen, (Said he,) we must now attend to the concerns of the society. Mr. Steady, I will begin with you, what have been your pursuits?" ?" — Mr. President, I have been very unsuccessful. You know I wrote a pamphlet in favour of the minis

Mr. GREGORY WILSON,
N this early stage of my profelsion,
I have had occasion to remark on the
precarious and unprofitable condition of
an author. What a variety of difficulties
has he to encounter! In the first place,
Rs he writes for bread, it is not to be
fupposed that he can follow the advice
of Horace,

It, theresore, Seldom happens, but that
his piece comes into the world with
many, and perhaps glaring faults, which,.
could he have bestowed Sufficient time
in the correcting of his work, would not
have been the cafe. Critics are too apt
also, to expose the faults of a work, in
order to show their own discernment:
they forget the excellencies which might
counterbalance those faults, and the bad
qualities, therefore, being alone laid before
the public eye, the author is instantly
Set down for a fool.
You will wonder how, in So short a
time, I could have acquired this knowledge
— By an attention to the advice
and experience or my little editor. I
have written two or three more essays
for him, which he does me the favour
to praise, and I suppose will not fail to
keep his'promise v/kh refpedf to the re

crown, ivy was intwined.

which all at once he put in his
pocket, and exclaimed, You think

Throwing his eyes wildly round, I
caught his attention; — he started. I was
Serioussy alarmed; for I did not doubt

Soon after the purchase, walking as I usually did in the castle, it being uninhabited, I perceived the eastern window, through which we came; prompted by curiosity, I entered with great difficulty, and felt Some kind of satisfaslion from what I Saw, enjoining myseif a law never to let the morning blush upon me, unless when kneeling at the altar, and every evening pass my humiliating hours till midnight upon the prostrate Hone.

One circumstance, indeed, con.

of my evening traces through the wood,
a wolf, gnashing his teeth with hunger
and expedation, darted out of the thickest

This letter gave both pleasure and pain to rosalie; the knowledge of Soon beholding her beloved father, was a balm that Somewhat mitigated the Sad thought of the colonel’s possibly meeting Lester; her imagination presented with horror her husband weltering in his blood, with lester’s Sword plunged in his bo some.

times volatile even to levity. I had a
young lass with me yesterday, whose extravagance
in modest levities delighted
me; she laughed. Sung, danced, and
played enchantingly. This was only
while we were alone, for on the approach
of Garcias her pretty animated eyes Sunk
into the demure, and her whole countenance
became sombre, I remarked
this to her with much’surprize, on his
going out again, and received for answer,
that she had been taught never to
appear delighted in the company of men.
nor permit them even to guess at the
workings of the Soul from the turn of
the countenance, for gravity was ever
esteemed discreetness and maiden like
modesty.
Thus are women educated

At the expiration of three 'years, it
was the pleasure of the'/ilmighty that
ray
mother should be no longer an inhabitant
of this world.
Her loss Seemed to be more than my
father could Support; he threw himself
on
her deathbed — he tore his hair
called upon her name — kissed her cold
lips, and fell into convulsions on her
lifeless body.
When he recovered from this violent
lit of grief, he fell into a state of melancholy,
which every one thought would
have Sent him to join her.
Our domestic affairs being without a
person to manage them, my father Sent
for a cousin of his; she came, and from
the day of her entrance into the house I
may date every misfortune tstat has happened
to me.
She had been three months in the
house before I observed anything un

ing called me to his closet, and there
ashed my advice. The house, he thought,
ought to be managed by one who would
have an interest effedually at heart, by
her own being conneqed with it. In
short, he concluded by informing me,
that he intended to marry his cousin.
I was thunderstruck; however, it be
longed not to me to oppose my father,
and they were married.
I, from this event, observed a change
in my father's dispofition towards me;
it did not, however, give me much uneasiness
till my mother in law
was
brought to bed of a fon. It was now
that I felt the uneafiness of my situation;
I was not onlf not considered or treated
as the eldest fon of my father, but as an
intruder, as one who was an insupportable
encumbrance.

My intimacy with her Sather naturally produced a kind of friendship with his only child — his Anna; for whom I Soon felt certain tender fensations.

Lord Blagrave now began his odious

not the Smallest degree of attention to.

We drove for about eight hours, as near as I can guess, over barren heaths, and through uiifi'eque.nted roads, still at last having gained the Summit of a hill, the chaise turned to the left j and having passed through a narrow lane, drove up an avenue of old trees, to an antique castle, where it stopped.
Alighting, I was conduced into an apartment, into which Lord Blagrave followed me. Approaching me in the most insulting manner, he welcomed me to albury castle. My Lord, ” replied I, hear'me : I am in your power, it is true; but are you aware of the consequences

the forlorn situation of an author.
This was but the prelude to a most

not to wish to follow any other.
I replied, that there was no other
pursuit that I did not prefer to it. He

The other day, I waited on my be

discovered a granddaughter, whom
he feared by Some means was Seduced,

desired me, therefore, to go and hire

I reached her the jug of water, and
went downstairs. I have not Seen her

for an inhuman brute, and asked to See

Gracious God! what did I feel
when upon approaching the bed I found
it to be my Monimia! I thought I should
have died! The dear girl’s eyes were
closed; our entering made her open
them. ‘‘ Where am 1 ?” Said she, ‘‘and

Before I Set out, I returned to my bene fador, related to him the tale, told him I knew, and loved the dear girl, and begged him to proted her in my absence. He promised he would, and accompanied me to See her. When we

My benefactor approached the bed. He had no sooner cast his eyes on the dear girl, than he started and exclaimed. Gracious God! I thank thee.'" She looked at him, and clasping her hands together, Almighty God! thou hast heard my prayer." The old man fell on her neck, kissed her and wept aloud : My child! my child! I have found thee, and am happy." After their mutual embraces, he informed her that her mother was his daughter. She looked surprised and pleafetf. Her countenance brightened up, and She asked him

The physician coming in, was Surprised at the alteration in his patient’s health for the better, and pronounced her : not only out of danger, but able to get up.
We therefore left her to dress herself. When she was dressed, we came to her, and led her downstairs, countermanding the order for the post chaife, paid the landlady liberally, and led her between us to a coach, which conveyed her Safe to her grandfather’s. When

NO Sooner arrived in town, than I went to my friend. lushington’s lodgings; he was not there. Impatient to See him, I went to a Colonel beverley’s; I found the whole house in afflic: Lushington had been brought thither wounded. We know not yet the particulars, but the Surgeon Says, though a bad wound, it will not prove dangerous, unless any Sresh Symptoms

What a family is this! How venerable
an old man! how lovely a girl! They
both attend on my friend with the most
assiduous care, and show their love for
him by their attention to me. The
Surgeon thinks it advisable I should not
see him yet, as a Sudden surprise may
be dangerous; I have therefore complied
with his desire, and shall defer
visiting him till he is Somewhat recovered.

This lovely girl is the dear friend of
my Spanish relation; their unexpesled
meeting was the pride anci boast of hu
man n uure; it was the meeting of Souls.
mon.mia’s happiness was indeed fortunately
alloyed, by fears for lushington’s
health, or the rapture would have been
too exquisite. This girl, if I mistake
not, is too much interested in his welfare.

T was Lord Blagrave, wdth whom Lushington had been fighting. I was admitted to See him yesterday, and he insormed me, that accidentally being in his company, and hearing him boast of his amour, his indignation was roused, and calling him out, they sought. His wound is now out of danger, but his regiment is Sailed without him. That is not of much signification, 1 believe, for Colonel Beverley Seems glad of it;

This production is more a kin to the romance of the last century, than to the novel of the present day.
The scene is laid in the court of Philip Augustus, king of France, a monarch who united with bravery and wisdom, every virtue and accomplishment that could dignify a prince or adorn a man. The gallant manners of that brilliant court are agreeably described, and that unhappy and fatal pastion of the lovely Eloifa de Clairville, is a tale that must awaken Sympathy in the bosom of every fon and daughter of Sympathy

TALE OF CHIVALRY.
In 2 Vols. timo^ Price 55. Jewed,
This ancient chronicle, like the tales of other times, is entertaining and interesting; it pretends not, however, to real antiquity, nor is it a successful imitation j modern refinements glare through the veil, and the political speculations of our reforming neighbours give a firikii>g hue to the whole. M. de Gorgy contrans the oppressive with the benevolent lords, but gives the victory to the latter.

A tender little story, interesting but improbable. The author in the second volume approaches too near the Splendour of roulseau not to appear in a disadvantageous situation' ' most pleastng pans of this novel were in our opinion the artlcfs picturesque descriptions of the habitations of the Alpine regions.

It may be a talc of truth, for it is not unnatural, and it is a tale of great diflreis. (stiarlotte, by the artifice of a teacher recommended to a School, from humanity, rather than aconvrction of her integrity, or the regularity of her former condudf, is inticed from her govc irefs, and accompanies a young offivei to America; the marriage ceremony, if not forgotten, is poitponed, and Charlotte dies a martyr to the inconstancy of her lover, and the treachery of his friend. The Situations are artless and affecting; the deferiptions natural and pathetic. We Should feel for i’hailotte, is suck a person ever existed, who for one error, Scarcely, perhaps, deserved so fe^ere a punistiment; if it is a fiction, poetic justice is not, we think, properly distributed.
