THE Publistier thinks it a duty incumbent! upon him to return his most warm and unfeigned thanks to her Grace the duchess of Devonstiire for So kindly giving her name to adorn this little work— — proudly confesses that the very extensive Sale thereof was chiefly. owing to this obligation, though it procured
him the envy of a few malicious mortals —.
much beneath his or the author’s notice He did not intend to offer this Second Edition till next season; but, on account of the great demand for the work, thought it not prudent to

leave it so long out of print — therefore for the accommodation of the public had it dispatched with the greatest diligence and Speed.

N. B. Speedily will be publissied a Continuation of this Work, containing the principal
charasters, cat the request of many admirers of LORD WINWORTH.

There is indeed novelty in the conduct! of the story and in the delineation of the " characters— — — author’s address in ** concealing the event deserves great commendation.

** expectation and we are not Satisfied but in ** the very moment when the expectation cannot longer be ad vantageoufly concealed.. —. — The plot is also unfolded with great dexterity, and the denouement is an interesting part of the work.”

good nature. I told you in my
last: that I was to take a rural walk

with Mrs. Simpleton; but, chiefly owing to the monkey’s, wantonness, we were obliged to postpone it. This little creature of mischief having. found Mrs. simpleton’s bonnet, and

we went downstairs and

upstairs, everywhere, except the chimney. However, Tom Wilding, who, I dare say, perceived his brother s tricks, and thought it a pity to baulk the poor creature’s, merriment, found the bonnet, and
presented it to Mrs. Simpleton,
\
at the same time,, telling her,,
I
"That he supposed Master Pugg

As this affair put an end to our proposed walk, we determined to conclude the evening with domestic entertainment, and accordingly agreed to take a game at cards.

My dear Charles, I still remain

by the vileness of their actions. It Seems, Charles, there are too many
who think i their nobility gives them a privilege to vice; I see it, and
I hate myself: men, born with
titles, cap have no claim to respect or applause, but Such Charles, as win them. by their noble actions,

deserve them and are truly great; if there were no hereditary titles, we should not have So many of our

noblemen reduced; we should not have So many great ausiions to keep

t
titled beggar, must be more com temptible than an honest, industrious tradesman;; are my, can did sentiments; but Mr. Hartley my guardian thinks otherwise; he
tells me, Earl Winworth, my father. was a man of the nicest honour,
who prized himself because of his rank and Samily. I cannot See the honour of this family greatness; the man who acts well is as great as the Succestor to a crown, and my father, who was So elated within himself (Seeing he was the descendant of the late Win worths, and despised the humble who could not boast an ancestry like his,) now lies undistinguished in the grave, where
there is no rank, no degree; where
neither
!

neither title or fortune avail, and where virtue alone is the best friend; but you will Say, I am moralising; forgive me Charles; I was only wondering at the high born, who
are too proud of nothing, and look
down on their inseriors as if they were created in another manner.
Mr. Hartley insorms me that I am to dine with him next Wednesday at Sir William graveairs’s; I
I
never was there yet, though Sir William is my uncle, and indeed
Charles ' I must wonder that my father so tenacious of his honour, and So particular in his connexions should have left me the ward of Mr. Hartley, when certainly, my uncle. Sir William, is a greater man,

than common, is hid in obscurityj which I am yet to learn; perhaps as Mr. Hartley is a widower and without a family, my father preferred him to Sir William, whole house is always Sull; yet when 1 confider that one is a relation and the other is not, that one is high, and the other is plain, my wonder is the more excited.

My uncle is the same honejl man,
I have already described, and in re shect: to nobility, he seems to agree
I
with me; which I suppose is the reason of my father’s not perferring him to Mr. Hartley: his wife. Lady Graveairs, is a bustling, busy woman; stie appears to me never > to be idle and yet. never to do anything, such is her true and genuine character; there are two daughters,
Juliana and Harriot; my pretty cousins were very courteous to me, endeavour’d to vie with each other who should be the politer; these ladies, I believe, dont agree; there is envy apparently lurking in their hearts; I do suppose a fine cap on
the one, would create a jealousy in
the
L O R D W I N VV 0 R T H, O R T H E
the Other, and I remarked when Juliana was attentive to any particular gentleman, her sister exerted her best endeavours to supplant her : such are my coulins; — the company consisted chiefly in male characters; there were indeed a Lady Restless and her daughter; the two Miss Graveairs did not much admire Henrietta; she
was too hand Some, and consequently would spoil their Iport; Juliana asked me in a whisper, was not her gown a fright? I told my cousin I was no judge of female Sashions : this young lady Sung in the evening for us, and though she cannot boast of a fine voice, yet she poffes fed a manner which pleased; indeed she told us, ’ere she began, what to
i
, expect
\
  47
expect:, yet was too jpolite to give us that trouble of prejjing, which fine lingers, suci as my coulins pretend to be, generally impose upon the company : Lady restless was the most disagreeable woman I ever Saw, on account of a fatal distemper her ladyship postestes, which .not only puts hersels on thorns, but renders all around her uneasy and unhappy; I suppose by this descrip tion my friend eastly perceives I mean the figits; and indeed Lady restless was a very unpleasing example; we had not a quiet moment
\
while her ladyship staid; she was in a hurry to be gone, in a hurry to take. Henrietta, in a hurry for her fan, in a hurry for her Servant, an a

for everything; thus, agitated by this eager desire, this unhappy ■ inquietude, she moved from chair to chair, from room to room, and interrupted every promising moment of content; the consequence of this vras, that when her ladyship made her exit, the alfernbly enjoyed her absence : among the gentlemen we had a sirharry Credulous; this young,

practised, of the fair one’s he had undone, and of the happy cuckolds he created; if we can believe this

f
in aunt Betty s way. I affure you that I am always upon my guard, and as. I am in a very delicate situation' '
go abroad as seldom as possible;
I
sometimes Mrs. Simpleton, and only one dog, (her favourite Jefifi) accompany me: Mr. Wilding will not stay long in cthe house, his

As I think it may amuse my friend, I shall give her an account of our last night’s entertainment at home: Mr. Wilding, Mrs.
, Simpleton, the dogs, cats, and mas
/
Pugg, were the company. Mrs. Simpleton was perusing the coffee grounds, and Mr. Wilding was talking to me of his hunting, race ing, and Such, like diversions;; told me, he was once in love, but his Diilcinea thought it proper to forsake him; theresore he played

"there’s a f ranger m my cup,"

(cried Mrs. Simpleton.)
"Pray show him in, ” (Said her facetious nephew.) It happened now there was a knock at the door, and a young gentleman entered; Mr. Wilding Saluted him, and advanc
g
ing towards him, begged to know how he came out of the Cup. We indulged a laugh at this, though the gentleman could not understand the joke; it Seems the stranger was looking for lodgings, and thought Mrs. Simpleton had Some to let; however, being answered in the negative, and pre

CHARLES BENVILLE OF LORD WINWORTH.*
T MUST confess,, my dear friend, that your situation makes me uneasy; however, I have news to impart which may remove some
of your unhappiness; though I cannot approve of your sudden passion, your love for a woman whom
you know nothing about; a woman
\
who, perhaps, is beneath your lordship’s notice, yet I should not wish my friend was married without his own approbation; that he
should
memoirsofan heir. 95
t
should give a lifeless hand away,
though the bride may be deserving of all his heart; in short, that he should be wretched during lise, for love is as requisite as Sortune to render the marriage state comsorta ble and happy; I therefore advise you to be your own master in this; but I have made a discovery which may be of no Small advantage; I intended yesterday to go where Jack and I were So rude;, my Sather perceiving my preparation for visiting, told me he had invited Some friends, and wished that I could

stay and entertain them; accordingly I postponed my intentions;;

in assuring me, that if it be agreeable to Miss Marlowe,, he will accept her hand and leave it to her tos appoint the day,. I perceive tears now and then stealing down, Miss, marlowe’s cheeks; but, hope my friend it only proceeds; from the natural terror which,, seizes young females when about to change their,

We take, pains in Lord winworth’s absence to speak largely of his worth and goodness of heart j

then addreshng the youth, inquired his name and late success— — ■

"I have no name” (replied the
young writer) " no name, my lord, " sufficiently great to recommend

that gratitude is the most laud able characteristic of mankind,
"and that without it, the greatest

My ward listened to the young man with no Small attention; then

it was with some difficulty I obtained access;; sturdy woman, who
never, I believe, studied compliments, refused me admittance, ash

and finding no disguise in my person, at last vouchsared to admit
me to miss marlowe’s apartment.
The young lady was reading vv/ith melancholy attention, — — her eyes were fixed upon the book and filled with tears, which came without bidding, and Seemed to say the tale is and afesimg I

T AM well pleased that miss mar low has confided in my'friend,
and make no doubt but she will meet
your protection, which, indeed, her

pitiable distress deserves! — I Saw Something So placid, and So gentle in this young Lady as demanded respect, and sincerely wish the poor

of her wishes! I knew, my Lord,

that her consent came not from the

bottom of her heart; that either it was constrained, or, pretended.; but
I wonder your lordship did not inquire the name of Her Swain; I am

sure She would not conceal that, when
She So candidly consefsed her passion
\
Harry Credulous has, indeed, brought himsels into many Scrapes; but my friend did not tell me how he came acquainted with Mr.

Saville, who was So kind as to assist and desend your Lordship; that tash, was mine, but Charles was not present, or Lord Winworth should not have wanted him; I must envy Mr. Saville who filled his place, and executed the pleasing office of friendship in Such a praiseworthy manner.

"My daughter. Sir, — — my daughter is married I”
