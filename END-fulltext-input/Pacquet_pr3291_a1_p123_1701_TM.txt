I was as great a Stranger as yourself: an( since I promis’d to transmit to you a Character of this Country Parade, I have her undertaken to discharge my Duty; I shall therefore proceed to give you first a De scription of the Wells, and next of th Company \ 
It is situated upon the fide of a Heath jfb barren and fb poor, that had it not pro duc’d a Well, it would have yeilded No thing: Much Pains I perceive have bcei taken to improve the Walks, thp’ to littl purpose; for New tunbriige wees at ijling tohy as much exceeds the Old for Pleastire as a Girl of fifteen does a Woman of fifty for a bedfellow. The Fidters are as saucy as bum baylissfe at a seflions house> an( tug you by the Sleeve for half a crown thi very first tiny of your appearance. Thi chief Diversion at the Wells, is to Stan one at another; and he or She that is bef drefs’d, isthe greatest Subject of the Morn ing’s tittle tattle. Thechiefest Com pie ment among the Women is, I hose the Wa BE tersfa.fi well with your Ladijhif \ which is 
in plain Englifhj I hope, Madam, you p f well. The Sons and Daughters of For time thrive here So mightily, it is hard t( * ^ know the Lady from the Jilt, or the Lore

itiixone among another, like Skulls in a charnel house, or Knaves and Cuckoldsf at my lord mayor’s Show. A Glass of Rhenish is here prefcrib’d as the only Cordial with the Waters; and a Handful of Comfits esteem’d the best Breakfast. phy sttians Swarm here like pick pockets at a Fair; and Quality neither Eat, Drink, or. Exonerate without the Advice of a Doctor. The chief Leacliery of the beau’s is, to, watch the Ladies into their private Apartments, and if their Ears are but blessed with a Whiz when a Belfa opens her Sluce, they think themselves as happy in their own Fancies, as an old Leacher that peeps thro’ a hole and sees a Nymph in her Bathing, tub. Bachelors and their Mistreffes come 
I 
hither in Pairs; but marry’d People come down single. Men without their Wives,; and Women without their Husbands; fb that I fiippofe, whilst one part are here pieafing their Palates with a new Dish, the other may be gone to the Bath to feast, their Appetites with a fresh Dainty. The. chief Virtue afcrib’d to the Waters are the, 
~ * f 
following two: They very often cure the green ficknefs in Maids, and cause fruit fulnefs in marry’d Women, provided they are but properly administer’d by a young 
vigorous Fhyfitian: The old grisly Gjf^* 

nifts have but little bufiness here; th youngest Doctor, by the, Female Sex, i esteem’d the ablest, and runs away wit the most Practice; for which. Reason believe thewomen come hither to be Kils’ for health sake, much rather than be Ph) sick’d; and when the Patient is fb bad tte neither Lip nor Belly salve will do h good. She may be honestly given over j past Cure. Some Fools indeed, thro’ the great Opinion of the Waters, have mac their Bodies Such perpetual Aquaduct' that they have wash’d themselves ini mere Skeletons, and go creeping aboi like West indian Creoiians troubl’d wii the dry belly ach, it’s a rare place for Beau to be Jilted in a Wife, for many 1 up to be great Fortunes, who feed the Mouths with their'fails, and cover the •; Backs with their Bellies.. maiden hea here bear an extravagant Price, for a gre Lover of Priority, gave fifty guinea’s f one at secondhand, tho’ he bought it f span new, but unhappily heard fbon < ter, it had been sold for a Hundred a so night before; and when he.found hims cheated by his Commodity - broker, w forc’d to undergo the lash of the old Pi

ket, they may fels themselves for what Money they please, il they will but turn Slaves to pamper’d Leachery : Here are a great many gold mines to be found under the Petticoat, where an able Workman may line his Pockets at the trouble of dig ing., Here are many parts acted worth a wile man’s Observation; Gentlemen play the Fool, Ladies play with their Squirrels, poor Wh — play the Jilt, Sharpers play the Knave, the beau’s play the Bubble, the old Women the Bawd, the Servants the Pimp, and the Fiddlers play like Devils. 
Their chiefest Pastimes, next the old Trade of Basket'making, are the following four: Bowling at rub htillj where Fools lose their Money, and Knaves win it; Dancing upon southhorough greedy wdiere he that has another man’s Wise bv the Hand ov’r Night, often makes him a Cuckold ' before Morning; Walking in the Grove, where the ring doves Cooe above, whilst the Lovers Bill below, and project all things in order to make themselves happy at their next merry meeting; and Gaming at the groom porter’s, where every one strives to win, whilst the Box runs a way with the Money. 
Lodgings are fb dear and fb scarce, that a Beau is sometimes glad of a Barn, and a

My Landlord was a Farmer, and his very Out “houses were fb full, that having ihear’d fbme Sheep, he abated me half a crown a Week, to let the Wool lye in my bedchamber;; which means a Tick one Night had bury’d himself fb far in my Belly, that I was forc’d next Morning to borrow a shooe maker’s Pincers to pluck the bloodrthirsty Vermin out of his Nest by the arse, before I could get rid of him, for he had fill’d his Belly fb mil, and Buck fb close by the strength of his new Diet, that he held his hold like a bulldog; foi which Offence I punish’d him Blood foi Blood, according to the Old Law. 
The most Noble of their Provisions, is a pack faddle of Mutton, and a wheat ear pie, which is accounted here a Feast for an Heliogabalus; and is indeed fb costly a Banquet, that a Man may go over tc amflerdamarq^lt half a dozen Friends witi a fish dinner, and bring ’em back agair into their own Country, almost as cheaj as you, can give yourself and your Mistref a true tunbridge entqvt?im\n.ml.

A Letter of Advice from an old experienced City leacher^ to his Daughter at the Boards ing schooly being Rules to raifeher Fortune. 
Dear Daughtery 
I Hear you are a very forward Baggage of Fifteen, and the World thinks you Handfbme: Your Gifts and Acquirements must fiipply the Wa nt of Money; for tho’ your Education has been large, your Fortune will be but little; it being a Rule with us Citizens, to bestow most upon our Daughters Breeding, when we have least Portions to give ’em, upon this constdera tion. That in cafe we cannot make ’em Fortunes to match with Tradesmen, we are in hopes, if they are Beautiful and well-bred, they will have Graces enough to recommend ’em to Gentlemen; for it a Shopkeeper takes to him a Wife without a Portion, he’s pointed at as much for a Fool,, as a Man is for a Cuckold, whose Wife is brought to Bed within three Months after he has marry’d her • But Gentlemen of e states may pl the Simpleton at any time, and its being so common a thing, makes it past off as much unregarded, as champar ty in Lawyers, or Simony amongst Clergy 
V 

gy men; therefore, since the Happiness < that part of yoiir Life to come depends uj bii the good Management of this weight Foint, Matrimony, I think it necessary t ^rni you with these following Instruct Oils, that in cash Fortune flings a Man e Merit in your way, yop may know ho to counterfeit tkosh outward Signs of ir ward Excellence, as may deceive the wish! Man into a great Opinion of your Virtue tho’your natural Inclinations may be loos and vicious; Or if it be your fortune t flush a welhfledg’d Woodcock, in whoe You can be happy, I Shall teach you wit what alluring Arts and prevailing Subtle ties he is most likely to be taken. 
Jf you would pi'oeure the Esteem of ai ingenious Man, be as rnodest in his company as a Nun at High Mass; yet let you Carriage be as stately as an Alderman’ daughter’s at a public Feast; for ’tis i receiv’d Opinion among the Judges of you Sex, That st referv’d Behaviour is the siires Sign of Virtue, and Pride in a Woman th best Guardian to sheure it. besure be a Iparing of your Words, as vyife Men are o. their Promishs, or Courtiers of their Per formances; and when you do speak, let II be fbmething that’s pretty, but as concifi as the Prophecy of an Oracle; for an inge 
niou! 

nious Man dreads the Tongue of a talkative Woman much more than a Squirrel does the noise of a Drum, or an Atheist a, Clap of Thunder. Take care to be o bliging, but not free; and tho’ referv’d, yet not haughty; for Scorn. or fondness to a deshrving Man, are equally intolerable, • Tho’ you love the Town as dearly as an old citizen’s young Wife does Ttmhridgc, or Epsom yet be careful how you acknowledge you are enamoured witn its Vanities, condemn the noiste Hive, and Show aver fion to its vicious Pastimes; speak Slightingly of the plsty house, tho’ you admire it as much as a ^ealot does the Church, or a Beau a dancing fehool, and show a seeming Inclination to a sedate Country Life, tho’ ’tis what you abominate as much as a marry’d Woman does Barrenness, or a Libertine the Thoughts of Wedlock. Be always ready to acknowledge the Sovereign Authority of a Husband, and the Duty and Submission of a W ife, tho’ your headstrong Temper is as great an Enemy to Obedience, as a Fanatic is to Loyalty, or a prbiid Woman to mean Apparrel: Let the Clergy thus be your great Example, preach up paslive Obedience and non refistance towards a Husband, as they did towards their Prince, it will please your Suiter to assert it, tho’ 
T' you 

you nev’r design to practice it. When Ik offers you a Present, neither Iliglit it, no be fond on’t, but receive it with as much In difference as Hypocrites say their Prayer or read a Chapter in the Bible. W hen he of fers to kifs you, neither turn your Head to wards him, nor from him, you may ver ture to let him modestly take a Salute, br be sure don’t you offer to give it him; b careful alfb that you pout not out your LI whilst he is poflesting of the Favour, fc that’s as much as to say Yes, to what is ol ten obtain’d without asking for. If he ai tempts to gripe your Thigh or Finger, C handle the Bottom of your Stomacher, th( you are never fb well pleas’d with what he going about, you must put on a counterfe Frown, and seem to be as i\ngry as a Judge when, thro’ Mistake, the Bribe is present to himself, that Should have been given i his Lady. If he offers to touch your Bui bies, you must cry, Nay, pray, Sir : if I huggs you about the Middle, you mu cry, O fie. Sir 1 And if he presumes i tickle the Palms of your Hands, you mu then cry, Foh. .Never rail against any your own Sex, for that discovers ill N ture. Never commend one Man in tl hearing of another, for that’s ungratef to him that loves you. Tho’ you fan( 
Wii 
 
wine as much as a Beau does Chocolate, never be seen to drink any in the company cs a prudent Man that Courts you, Idl it wastes away Discretion, which is the Bridie of the Tongue, and causes the unruly Member to betray your Weakoels. Never miss Church, tho’ you go tossed with as ill a Will as a Scold does to a ducking stool; and if you cannot answer the Reader as you ought to do, dissemble with your Lips and your Eyes as if you did; for without a little Hypocrisy you’ll never be thought a devout Christian: Let your table library in your bedchamber be fur nished with good Books, and tho’ you mind ’em as little as a Cuckoo does her young Ones, yet turn down a frest Leaf in the Practice of Piety every Day, and lay it open in the Window. Hold up.your Pan when anybody names Smock; blust when anybody praises you; turn your Head when anybody looks at you *, bow when you are drank to sitting; courfie when you’r bow’d to standing: and whenever your Lover says, God five the King, be Sure you cry, Amen; and it will oblige him wonderfully; for Loyalty in a Woman, tho’ it signifies nothing, will fbme times take with a Man of Worth as much as anything : Mind these Rules with an 
inge 

ingenious Man, and you may prpbab gain your Ends to your life’s Happiness therefore every Morning, after your Pra; ers, Con this over as your next best Le ion, till you have it as perfect as an Actre has her Part, and one time or other yc may chance to find it useful. 
But if it be your fortune to be lik’d by Fop, poffefs’d of an Estate stifficient t maike your Life comfortable, you mu then cnange your Behaviour as much as Chameleon does its Colour, turn your Ri lerv’dnefs into Freedom, your Silence ini Tattle, your Gravity into Air, your Difcn tion into Vanity, your Wit into Puns, an see all over Action like an Eel new takei according to the following Directions; fc the Surest way of Trapaning a Fool, is b humouring the Cockfcomb with the lik Folly, as the Fox catches the Hare, b distembling, the like Fear, c. 
In the first place you must mimic hi Cringes andforirialities, s if you were hi Monkey; and Show as many Antic Ge stures in your Compliments as a Kittej playing with a string: be as stngular in e very thing as if you would fet your self uj for an Original Belfa, and let one Won ih five be French in whatfbever you tall

in the sunsiiine, and, ape like, never cost tinue a Minute in one Posture: lausfial ways when you Speak, and endeavour rcl make everything a Jest, tho’ not a word of Wit in’t; talk always within his Sphere; complain the weather’s very hot in Summer, tho’ you find your leif in an Ague, ^ and cry it’s cold in Winter, tho’you are within two Foot of a roasting Fire; rail against your own Sex for a Parcel of tawdry Minxes; but let your own Apparel; in gaudy Colours out lhine the Rainbow: assert Freedom in a Woman is the ostiv 
1 " m 
Sign of Virtue, and that the filent lady is the still Sow that eats up all the Draught You must be Sure to praile'all gay fool to be pretty Gentlemen; and he that stings a way his Money most like an A is, to be a Mast of wonderful Generosity: You must rail against the grave wise Man, and call him the world’s Slave, one that lives upon Earth as if he did Penance for the Sins of his Ancestors: Express a Hatred to all Merit; call the parson heaven’s dark iant lk)m, the Soldier a clodskul’d Hero, the Ttadestnan nasty Mechanic; and Seem to admire no Mast but the very Blockhead you design to make your Market on; applaud his Deportment, tho’ ’tis more ridi«^ eulous than a French dancing*master’s f 
ap 
 
approve his Wit, tho’ it be more nauseor thap a player’s; and commend his dres tho’ ks more Santaftick than Sir fofu. hiitteps; rail against Sermons as a ufele Cant in fb knowing an Age, and commen Plays as the more edifying Doctrine: Ca all Schollars but a Parcel of book learn’ Dunces, and justify Beau Wilson was a cur ninger Man than an archbishop of Cante\ bury. Flatter him as if hie were a Princ for the more you deceive him that wa the more he’ll love you. Eeasexpensh to him as you can, ’tis the best way to f cure him, for a Fool will never part wit that easily he has purchas’d dearly, tho’ ben’t worth keeping. Sonietimes con plain you have hurt your Knee, fbmetimi that your Stomacher hurts your Belly,; play him round the bush where the Gan lies, and you’ll find him the more eager f the Sport. Now and then show him tl Small of your Legg, but seem not to know that he. sees it; then clap your Hand dov your Breasts, and complain of a Flea, ’tw make him with his Fingers in the far place. Now and then spread the Toss of his Neckcloth, or stroke a straglii Hair of his Wigg into exact Order; gi him a tickle of the Side, or take him by t Hand, play the part of a Gypfie, and t 
hi 
 
him his Fortune; for Fools are as much to be won by love toys, as Children are with Nicknacks; theresore do but play the Fool with him as much as he does with himself, and you may draw him after you as Amber Willa Straw, and influence him far more than all the Stars in the Hemisphere. To Show your Airynefs, you must flutter about the Room like a Bird in a Cage; and when you hear him humming a Minuet, you must be ready to dance to it. you’li have no occasion to alter your Carriage for what Company you See Iiim in, for none will play with him but Puppies of the same Kind, only of another Litter. The Documents 1 have given you are sufficient for the present; and if you chance to entangle such a Fool as I have hinted at, in the Net of Wedlock, I will then further instruct you how you Shall use him; in the mean time study both your Parts, that you may act either to the Life, wshen occasion requires it; and nothing stiall be wanting, but Money in me, to complete your Happiness, therefore take care to marry him that wants it not, and you will add great Comfort to the grey Hairs of your aged Father,

Some time Since there was brought from the devil‘ss Arse pte Peak, to Miles mu fick*house at 1/ungton, a strange sort of a Monster, that does everything like a Monkey, but is not a Monkey; mimics Man like a Jackanapes, but is not a Jackanapes; jumps upon Tables, and into Windows upon all Fours like a Cat, but is not a Cat; does all things like a Beast, but is not a Beast; does nothing like a Man, yet is a Man: He has given Such wonderful Content to the Butchers of cure market, that the House is every Day as full as the Bear garden; and draws the City wives and and Prentices out of London, much more than a Man bang’d in Chains for Ravishing his Sweetheart, and Knocking heron the Head to oblige her to keep counsel: It happen’d lately upon a Holiday, wlien honest Men m^alk’d abroad with their Wives and Daughters, to the great Consumption of hot Buns and bottle ale, that the Same of this Mimic had drawn into the Mustek

A love letter from a Gent km ah to a Crooked ladjtj cg. 
maiamy 
you have often charg’d me with Flattery in my Addresses to your ladi fhip, and think I cannot love you for a Wife, because of your Deformity: To deal plainly with you, ufingno more diffimu lation than one geneva Christian would do with another, upon my word. Madam, the Singularity of your Shape, next to the Prettiness of your Fortune, was the Second Motive that induc’d me to bear an honourable Regard to your dear dislocated per fbn, whom lam very defirousof making my lawful Copartner, for the Sundry Rea ions following: 
In the first place. Madam, I have taken inte my Consideration the common Frailties of your Sex, having found, by obfer vation in this debauch’d Age, that Incontinence is usually as inherent in a pretty Woman, as covetousnefs in a clergy man, or Jealousy in an old Fumbier; and have 
from thence concluded that Such Virtue is 
% ^ 
the most secure, amidst the wars.of Venusy that has the least Beauty to invite love’s 
Cham 
\ 


Champions to attack it; then consequently that Woman is most likely to prove: nappy wife to a Man who dreads Cue I koldom, whose Virtue, like your Ladi 
I ship’s, is fortified with fb strong a Bull 
work, that none, linlefs through' Spite, mor 
I than the Honour of the Victory, would at 
; tempt to conquer. 
Secondly, Madam, I Should think m; 'I Self exempted stem the great Trouble C 
Difeovering your Disposition, which fbm times proves a Seven Years Task for a mai ry’d Pilot to fathorn, before he finds or the way to steer rightly for the Safety C his Family; but in you I take it for gramme ' ed, your Conditions are as crooked as th 
, Mould they’re cast in, and do affure you, II had rather marry a Woman like your La 
disbip, who I have good reafbn to believ 
II would be ill humour’d to everybody, thai 
a complete Beauty, who, thro’ the Sweei 
LI nest of her Temper, would be good na 
I tur’d to others, as well as my felfi 
;! Thirdly, Madam, Because you are 
Lady of incomparable Breeding, and hai 
double the Complaifancc of a straight W( 
man, for you never cur’ste but you Boat the lame time, also hate to Show tl 
II ill Manners of turning your Bacfofide uj

being a great sign of Grace, makes me believe you a good christian, tho’actuoked Disciple;; that you labour hard in the Paths you tread, to be thought an upright Woman. 
t 
Fourthly, Madam, I confickr there’s but little Difficulty in making yuu conformable to my own Temper, because you are, already bent to my Bow, and can do no i otherways than stoop to anything I stall ddire you to Submit to, which humble .Condescension must contribute highly to a husband’s Happintfs: Besides, Should you chance toover hear a loud unmannerly Laugh or idle Jest arise in Company you’d be apt, for the ease of others,, to take it all upon your ovvm Back. 
Fifthly, I am persuaded, Madam, you will make Matrimony a very healthful State, for I dare fwcar, wliofoever mars ries you, will never bring himself into a 
Consumption by a libidinous Excels with his own Wife. 
. » 
Sixthly, Madam, I confider the Gqd of Love is a great Archer; and you being as crooked as a Bow, and I as straight as an Arrow, were we both lock’d up together in the cafe of Matrimony, the blind Deity, who delights fb much to Shoot at Hearts would doubtless think us sit Inc

I to the head, I Shall hit the Mark. 
I ~ 
Madam, I must needs C fess, I love a Woman, as a true Spc man does Venifbn; who, if the Meat but well feafbn’d, and the Crust but gi in its kind, has very little regard to fashion of the Pasty; fbi doubt not I your ladiship (tho’ Nature has mouh 
you into a homely Form) has as good FI to satisfy the Appetite of a hungry Lot I as if your stdes had been railed accord: 
I to Art, up to the best Proportion; Befic 
I in Fruit we always find that Crumplii

I hope, Madam, the Reafbns I have ven you will prove flifficient to convii you I can love you for a Wife, notwi standing your outward Imperfections, all I would desire with a Female He mate to Sweeten the bitterness of that bi die of Rue, are Riches and Virtue, t ' one to secure me from Want, and the

being a Buck or a Beggar: Therefore, Madam, if you will undertake to protect from the two Evils aforementioned, S will venture to plunge my self into thatoce an of Troubles, Matrimony; and with all good Nature and Industry notwithstand ing your Small Inducements) will honestly perform the refreshing Duties of a Husband; for, to tell you the Truth, what I chiefly covet is, to live well y andthega mel laden with Indian Riches, tho’hehas an ugly Bump on his Back, is, to me, far more welcome than an alexmdeps buch fham; for I must needs confess to your ladisbip, I never value what Beast I ride upon, provided Frii but easily carry’d: so begging ydii will be pleas’d to take these things into your Gonfideration, and think me worthy of a Satisfactory answer, and you will for ever Oblige, Madam, the most honest Plainctealer of all you Admirers,

I the Inhabitants, which I desire you 
accept, as follows: 
i The Tovm is the most sinful Part ( 
good bishoprick, where the Company I rupt their Insides as often as they cle 
their Out; blacken their Souls tho’ d! wail their Bodies; both Sexes mine 
much more what the Physician says, t what the Parfbn preaches. The Bath II is a hell kettle of hot Water, where ast ed Sinners stew out their Dileafes, and Liquor that remains, is a Mess of Porri for the Devil. The Temple of the I is made a House of Assignation; the w ed Congregation, a Convention of lui Hypocrites; the Pews built Ogling beigl for the Conveniency of Temptation. Sermon turn’d into Ridicule, by the Be and belifa’^s, and the Parfbn, but doe Af Andrew that gathers the Parade togetl the Situation of the Church is very o modious for Gamesters, one Door oper upon the Raffling - Shop, and Bowli Green, fb that the Bones of the Devil r|ttkd over the Bones of the Dead, 
r ____ 

the Quality themselves, whilst their Footmen ( purfiiant to their good Example) make hazard tables of the tortih stohes; and, thoughtless of Mortality, upon Holy Ground, at a bad Chance, calf the Devil to their Assistance : The Gentry upon the Green, are well worth a Wife man’s Ob ■ Serration, where they use more Language to their Bowls, than the Driver of a Wagon does to a Team of Horse, and much after the Same manner, only the Dialect is Somewhat different: For as the Carter cries, Grr, the other cries, lea and as kd^h cries, JT(3, the Bowler cries, Ralt j both Terms used in the same Sense, tho’ Some thing in sound they vary, fbme calling as ctrnestly to their Bowls to mend their pace, as if the Lignum Vita Messenger was as inr telligible, as he who Sent it of an Er,, to.the Block; another stamping at the Trigger, to stop the Fury of his Bowl, as if at one stroke with his Foot, he could give an earth quake to the universe, every one Showing such Antic Postures in his Turn, as if all the Tumblers in the Kingdom were met together, to Show the Spectators the Flexibility of their Joints, The Lodgings, h\s true, are pretty neatly fur hifh’d, but as dear to those that occupie lem, as Shops in Cheapfide; and if you 
^ ■ P d t chance 

cliance to be fb ill, as to require the Ust a warming pan, it will cost you as mi in brofh wood, to make Coals to wa your Bed, as in Town you may buy a I of ordinary Sheets; for Firing being fb ry dear, that a Family might have tl Victuals dressed in lcwc;?, could it be f down hot by the Coach, and Save Moi by the Bargain. The Inhabitants, f Months in the Year, are as proud as Lt fer and as fawcily imperious to their L gers, as a rich Victualler to a Parcel journey men Tailors; but as humble i other Eight, as a londondvintncv., ir long Vacation : The Servants, like th Masters and Mistreffes, are as Mercen; as Town strumpets; and if they anfv you but what’s a Clock, they’ll expect! Pence for their Labour; the Women bei 
as ready to open their Legs as their Shout 
if they can get but anything by i Bargain; but without Interest, do ev( thing as unwillingly as a Dog that turn Spit, or a Miser, that lends his Mon upon doubtful Security. A thousand tin as much could I say of this Renown Place, - were it proper to make a Letter long as an Independent Sermon, but know ing what I have already writ, will tyre ye Patience, I will change the Scene, a

X 
My dear Harlikin, 
iwas in great Hopes we should have once more met, according to our old Custom, at the grand Revels at St. Bartholomew, to have folac’d ourselves over a fat Pig and a Bottle, and have droll’d upon the past Hardships of a long Vacation; but the Master bee of the great Hive, the City, to please the peevioi Wasps, and zealous horn heads of the Canting Crew, has buzz’d about an Order, There Shall be no Fair, to the Frustration of our Hopes, and Disc ppointment of our Creditors, that the Tally men walk about biting their

have Forty Shillings; which indeed (lay they) are insiifferable Indignities to be put on the Worthy Magistrates of enguntls fam’d Metropolis : Further, charging us with teaching upon our Stages, the wick ed Mystery of Intriguing, Instructing their Wives, by our Plots, to be too cunning for their Husbands; and their tractable pretty Daughters, to be too witty for their Parents: Alleging, That had not the Drolls been timely fupprefs’d thro’ the Piety and W ifdom (tho’ ifome say Interest) of Domine Oroonoko^ they would have suffered under the frightful Apprehensions of Cuckoldom over running the City, as bad as Schism has done the Church; and that their Wives, in a little time, would have thought Liberty of Conscience as good a Plea for withdrawing their Love from their Lawful Husbands, and transt ferring it to their Gallants, as a double ^ Christian does for renouncing the Lawful Church, and betaking himself to a New Religion: So that, from these Considerations, we are depriv’d of our ancient Privilege, and are decreed to suffice Nature with Potatoes and Small Beer, during the merry Seafbn of the Fair, in which we us’d to indulge our Appetites with the palatable Dainties of Pig and Pork, and

Comfort of all Libertines, they may be as drunk at the Fair without Notice, as an Alderman at a lord mayor’s Feast, Swear as many Oaths as a hackney coach man at a Stop in the Street: And as for the wag tails of my own Sex, they abound in all Parts of the Fair, as much as Pig and Pork in every cook’s Shop in smith feld; and tho’ there are no Drolls to begin an Amoiir at with a Lady of the Mask, yet he, whole Tail is in tune to dance Adames Jig, may have recourse into Cock, Hosier or chick lane, where he may meet with bad Women enough, and good conve niencies for his Purpose, be greatly wick fed at a Small Expense, and have a fair Opportunity of committing those foul Sins in private, which fb public a Place as a droll booth cannot postibly admit of: I cannot but with great Pity and Concern, reflect on the wretched Condition of Poof Hackney harlots, that miserable Part of my own Sex, in this Reforming Age, who having heretofore no more to maintain than their own Selves by their Sins, are how by the wise Conduct of the Society of vice mongers, ehjoyn’d the Penance of being twice as wicked, to sustain a numerous Rabble of their Mercinary perfe tutors, fb that it need not be doubted but

our modern Poets are. Yet I would not 
\ 
have you Suppose that I have the least design to write a Satyr againb fvb, as a late Author has done; who through his whole Poem, has been fb sincerely un witty, that he leaves us no room to doubt of the Reality of his Intentions; No, Sir, as this is altogether foreign to my Inclination, fbi question not, but I Should be very unsuccessful in the Performance; being apprehensive, that I might be fb unfortunate by Some unfeafbnable Impulse of Fancy, as to betray the Cause I endeavoured to Support, and fb make the World suspect that I writ Booty. aftuming fbmc Vanity on this occasion, I have thought a thousand times, that Witandl should never have parted; I relistf d all its Frolicks, was never pleased without it, and never discouraged by the no taste of fbme Coxr combs of my Acquaintance; who, by the by, were Perfbns of no inconstderable Quality, (for Folly does not degrade a Man,) and are nov the Acquaintance of Statet men and privyrcouncellours: I say, that parting with Wit, was a thing I could never have foreign; and tho’i was Something averse to it for a while, yet I found at last, it was very necessary and expedient: 
For n^twit^anding the glitterir^ Figure 
Ee 4 It 
 
it makes, I don’t perceive it is any re: Advantage to a Man, who endeavours t make his Fortune: On the contrary, ’t I generally an Obstruction to a man’s Pn

coverably lost his Practice; but by the happy Influence of his benevolent Stars, he had not fwallow’d So large a Dose of Wit, as to work his Destruction; and fb, (like the insignificant Efforts of old Age, with an infectious Harlot,) his very Impbtency fav’d him. 
Demetrim of the Imer temple, has lately shld his Chambers, and has taken a Lodging near the playhouse: : laid, that he intended to turn Coke upon Littleton into Blank Verse, (to fbften, in fbme Mea sure, the Ruggedness of the Expression)) might perhaps have fiicceeded as well in it, as a certain Spark of my acquaintance, of whom it is reported, that he attempted to Translate a very odd kind of st Book, call’d hudibrruy into French Meeter. This 
Gentleman is frequently possessed- -- --

I have now done with this Gentleman, 
whom I leave at temple bar \ and go directly on to the City, where I observe, that Wit makes but a very indifferent Figure, nay, even on a lord mayor’s Day, with all the Pomp of Pageants to fiippiort it; and i’ve not heard that any cf that 
Character have fin’d for Alderman. When 
% — 1^ ’ 
they use the Word, ’tis generally in an ill Sense, as when they have cheated a Man in a Bargain, they cry they have Outwitted him. A remarkable Gallic Wit, whole 
in Per naff us were very confider able, yet upon account of the Uncertainty of the Income, has very prudently withdrawn his Effects, and converted his Sub itance to Indian Ware, which Undertaking Exactly agreeing with his Genius, prolpers lb fast, that he has more ladies^t his Shop every Afternoon, than he uled to have in the front Boxes, on the third Night of a new Play. Our island is very much addicted to Trade, but Wit is a Commodity, that few People deal in, and will never be a Staple Commodity till the Natives are better acquainted with its Value; I fbretel, that this may probably happen in the next Century, but no Man that is already born, will live to lee it. Perhaps you may not a little wonder how

true for all that. I suppose by this tir

But to (peak to that part of your Letter which concerns yourself: I do not wonder, that you go to the play hou(e only stjr the sake of your mistress; but methinks, at the mufick meeting the Italians Noice might have Charms for you. But as you go thither too, you (ay, only for thefiike of your Mistress, I will believe, to oblige you, that file does not go for the eunueh^s.

I. Received yours, which was the iiior^ welcome, because it came without Invitation. I take it very kindly that you would write to me, more kindly than it you had made me a Present: For we certainly show most Kindness for any one, in that which we do for him contrary to the Bent of our natural Tempers. Now I have observed that you have been con fiantly less inclin’d to Show your Parts than your Generosity; At the very time that you have been Prodigal of Pelf, you have been a Niggard of Wit. By a Greatness of Mind you have squander’d the first, as a very worthiest thing; and by a just Discerning been thrifty of the last, as a very valuable treasure. But your Letter has given me Some hopes, that you begin to take the Advice which I have lb often given you; and that is, that for the Conveniency of Life, you would grow a little more frugal of Gold, and a little more free of your &nce. And I begin to imagine that you have till now been covetous of the latter only because you were laying in a Stocky that for the time to come you may be never

Dear Gabriel, 
when thy last was written, thou hadst 
put on the lyon’s Skin, and mad’st i a wondersul comical Figure in it. But I did not think toiiicenfe thee, nor the rest of the Rabble, quite contrary I thought to divert you. You say, you take it ill, that I Should upbraid you with understanding no Language but english. Why, 
: what a Pagan Apprehension hast thou, Gabriel f The Devil a jot did I upbraid' thee; Quite contrary, I commended thee for being willing to iinderstand no Language but plain English: And that, as I take it, has quite a different Meaning, With what unreasonable Wights have I had to do! who are offended at my Endeavour to please them, and take my * Commendations for Injuries. I am accus’d, you Say, of ill Breeding for that Letter, 
: Why, prithee, Gabriel every Man has not had the Breeding that thou hast. I wilh you had Sent me the Names of the ' Sparks who would reconcile Punctilio to Satyr. It has been a damn’d inveterate I Quarrel, and requires wise Mediators. 
But now I talk of Satyr, that ygu fey is

I receiv’d your Letter, and give you Thanks for your News. In Requital I Shall Send you Some concerning our Friend: In doing which, I comply both with his Desire and yours. He has been sick almost ever Since he came hither, tho’, excepting once, he has liv’d with exact Regularity. He Says, he believes the Devil restrain’d his Surfeit from breaking out till he was reconcil’d to Sobriety, to render it odious, and Set them afresh at Variance. I remember when I was at ptirisy there was a young Nun, whose Circumstances in Some meafiire resembled our friend’s: She had a Pox broke out upon her immediately after She had taken her Vow of Chastity. He bids me tell you, that he has been once Drunk Since he came to this place, and once Witty, and a damnable Sot ever stnce. Our Friend, I Siippofe, rallies. But one thing is certain; that Wine is as Sure to exalt Wit, as Paint is to heighten Beauty; but then, as the Devil will have it, (hearken to this, and tremble Torn) they both decay the very things they em 
belkih) even while they are giving them 
F f 4 Lustre. 

Lustre. But Tom., he bids me tell you, yo must not believe him Vain because he Say he was Witty; for he says it was among Such prodigious ’squires, that none but a S( would have been Witty in fiich Compan^ Our Friend, methinks, has reason: For is as much more scandalous to be Witi with Fools, than it is to be dull among Men of Wit, as an Error in Judgement more ridiculous than a Defect in Fancy. I says, he has.%^hundred times since he can to this place regretted the Rabble, nay, 1 has regretted the Grave Club; nay, he h 
wished himself even in the Witty Clu which he believes is by this time erecte 
He begins to look upon Ball -- -- as a gre 
Man, upon Jack G — ^ — as a Prodigy, ai upon W— — a demi god. Indeed a Da we do well enough here; for a Days \ converse with the living dead, that is, wi tliofe wsho being dead yet Speak : but t Night, Tomy the Night, in which we 2 doom’d to the dead living, that is, to th( who being alive.

If we could be So happy as to govern the Present, by the Example of the Past, and the rational consequence ^ of the Future, the Conduct of our Lives would arrive to Perfection, and we Should cease almost to think ourselves Men. But Oh, Anriintor! Tis not So whth me: With what Violence to my Nature, have I Suffered this Debate? The Extravagance of my Love has an hundred times appear’d with all its Ravishments.

to a Lady, whom he never saw: Being a true Relation of a Saturday Eights Adventure. By Mr. Farquhar. 
# 
I Have now, Madam, had time to reflect on Saturday Nightst Adventure : and if I have reflected on anything elfe Since that, may I never be blessed with Such an Adventure again. A Lady in a Malque, with a pretty Hand, that presently got hold of my Heart, desires to know where she shall See me after the Play; At the Rofcy Madam, Said I. There the Lady calls, like a Woman of Honour, where I was found, like a Man of Honour, and without much Ceremony, leaves three honest Gentlemen, and two roasted Fowds, to venture myself, Neck, and Gizard, with two strange Ladies in a Coach. Compliments (which, by the way, w^re pretty plain on my fide) being 
past 
 
past on both fides; the Ladies would ( nothing under the Role, but must drive the Fountain in the Strand. If the Ladi had informed me of their Quality, I h; called for Burgundy; but feeing nothii about them that promised beyond Qove% Garden I thought a Bottle of New Fren might be Suitable. They both were love with me, * but one a little forth gone than t’other; their discourse w Modest, and they drank like Wom< of Quality; for Our Bottle was Soon oi I was then impatient to return to n: Fowls; for I could not feed upon Cove ed Dishes. The Lady that was most love with me, promised t(? take off h Mask, if I should See her home. I promiss to Wait on her home, if she wuuld let n lie with her all Night. I was a Blockhei for that: for the Lady was angry, m with the Matter, but the manner of tl Exprestion : But I thinking still of Coven Garden., was not So very nice in my phras but at last, away we drove, and Set dow one Lady, the Lord knows where: Tf t’other (relying, I Supppfe, more upon ni Modesty than her own) had the Coura^ to stay alone with me in the Coach which, after Several Turningsi, stoj where we lighted, in Golden square; st 
ac 
advised me to make the Coach wait; which I thought a very good hint to discharge it., She conducted me upstairs to a very stately Apartment; and; she, according to her Promise, took off • her Mask; but pulsd her Hoods fb a i bout her Face, that I was as far to Seek for her Beauty as before. After Some I foolish Chat, in comes a Maid, with a red hot Warming pan, and retires into a Bedchamber;; returning presently, told her that her ladiship’s Bed was rea i dy; dropped a modest Curtefie, and made her bx/t : the laiy told me, stwas time for me to go to Bed. Madam, Said I, 
I with all the Speed Sm able; and began I to unbutten : but in spite of all my haste, she was abed before me. Our Conversation was free, natural, and pleasant, till ten a clock next Morning, 
I The Chamber was So dark, that I could I not See the laiy’s Face; lo vas forc’d to depart as great a Stranger to that, as when I met her first; tho’ I know e i very other part about her Sowell, that I j Snail never forget her. I hope Your La i diships will pardon my Familiarity:

A Comical love foyage to Hampton court, written in a Letter to a Friend at the Bach.

no a^dcquctfromvn'a^s, 
Ramble, recollecting fbme Women are like Foxes, and will venture to do those things abroad which can't be done near home without the Danger of Discovery. 
Being always as punctual in the Affairs of Love, as an Exchange Merchant is in Payment of Money, I waited on her at her Lodgings exactly at the time ap ppinted, and happened to catch her not quite dress'd; tho’ for fear, I suppose, I should pop upon her unawares, a little before the Hour, fly had taken Special Care, I perceive, to remove all nusan ces, having pick’d the Gumm out of the Corners of her eyelids, lick’d up a few Carr away seeds to Sweeten her Breath, though pretending for the vsind; rubb’d behind her Ears with a little orange flower Water and taken away the Frowfinefs of her foretop andsowreness of her arm pits, with a Puff or two of Jejfamin Powder, so that I found my delicious Creature, H when I gave her a Salute, in as sweet a ■P Condition as a Trunk full of old Linen 
laid up in Lavender ^ividirofe leaves^lh^t, ft; i had I kifs’d the Breech of a Mofcovite Cat, 
my Senses could not have been refresh’d E with a greater Fragrancy. After I had r done as much Penance in waiting till she I was 

was dressed, as a City Dunn does to speak with a Nobleman, she with much ado, had brought her headdress, Hoods, and Andershams in Subjection to her nice Fancy, altho’ I look’d upon her all the while, with as much earnestness as a Priest might do upon an Evil Spirit; Yet could I perceive no more Alteration for the better, aster an Hour and half’s unne cestary quidling of her Ornaments, than you shall find in a Negro's Complexion aster Scouring his Infernal Face .with a Pound of Soap or a Quart of Hungary Water. 
When she had thus finish’d her Mornings work, being lac’d up in her Stays, as tite as a Lekejlerjhire wool pack, I handed her downstairs into a Coach, and there made Love in a Tub till we came to the Waterside, where a ravein ous Astembly of Amphibious Scoundrels, Some with their Mouths full of Bread and cheese, and Oiiions, were ready to pluck us out of the Windows of our Leathern Sanctuary, before the Driver could have recourse to the Door to deliver us fairly into the vile Hands of the wrangling Fraternity. At last we pitch’d upon a couple of red cap’d Tritonswho handed us into their Wherry and became of 
a 

\ Sudden as civil and compiaisant as if 
they had been bred at an Academy; so that I found they only Scolded about who should carry the Fare, as Lawyers do at Wefiminfler about who shall carry the Cause. When I had Seated my Mistress on my right hand, according to the Foolish Custom of Englandand gave her the Superiority in Place, which their Sex are proud enough to claim, and ours foolish enough to give, tho’ contrary to the Laws both of God and Nature, our brawny Slaves Sat down to their Stretchers, and puffing and blowing at every Pull, like a Phtyficky Man in a Sweat, they rowed us onward of our Way, being every now and then Saluted with a Broad side of Such scurrilous Words and Bawdy phrases, that put my Lady s Modesty very much to the Blush, and me to a confounded Puzzle to defend ourselves, that I was forced to exert my Parts, and pelt our Adversaries in the B Billingsgate Dialect, of Rogue, Taylor, 
Whore, Semstrels, Scoundril, Informer, ^ Cuckold, Mechanic, Jilt, Exchange 
Woman, and all the ill Language I could i muster up to make Suitable Returns, lest 
I my Mistress should think me a Blocks 
I head. The Time I propos’d to spend in 
exhb 

exhibiting my Love to my fair Companion, and preparing her Heart for my design, with Such mollifying Endearments and prevailing Dalliances, as were necessary to warm the Inclinations of a Female Lover; I was forc’d to employ in studying wdiat to Say to the next Boat we met with : For the first Word, like the first Blow, I found, was half the Battle. After this manner we Smoothly Slid along upon the Slippery Surface of the gentle Thames; listening at Spare times to the whispering Flags and Osiers that adorn’d herpleasant Banks, and bow’d their limber Heads in Gratitude to the delightful Breeze that fann’d their verdant Blades into So musical a Motion. The Weather prov’d So temperate and extreme ly favourable (the Sun shining forth with stich an aulpicious Lustre that a finer Day could never blessed a Lord mayor’s Show, nay, the Coronation of an Emperor. At length we arriv’d at Mortlack. took a little Refreshment at the Old cuckold making Tenement, the Garter; and to enliven our Legs, which were almost numb’d for want of Action, we walk’d to Richmond where we ordered the Boat to meet us, by which means we avoided a tedious Circumference, which 
would 
f 
%• 
 
would have tirm us by Water, We walked cross the Fields link’d Arm in Arm, 
7 
as loving as any Man and Wife; and entertain’d one another’s Ears with unstudied prittle prattle; just Such kind of amorous Fustian as Love popp’d into our Mouths, came Simply out again, without any Amendment; that had a couple of bow’ftreet Critics been walking behind us, we should have given ’em more diversion than a Dialogue in the Pit between a Beau and a Mask, or the most elegant Piece of Courtship in a new Academy of Compliments. When we came to the ancient Town aforementioned, we resumed our Places in the Boat; and after two or three Hours laborious Tugging against the Stream, we arriv’d at the famous Port to which w’e were confign’d, where I handed my fair Fellow traveller on Shore, and discharg’d our Sweating 
(. Drudges; and having not above eighteen P Pence in Silver left in my Pocket, I put S my Fingers into my Phobb to examine I wdiat Gold I had. lodg’d within the. waste band of treasure; but finding it as empty as a Skull in a surgeon’s Window, 
I presently recollected, that overnight, 
I had taken out Seven Guineas and laid ’em I in my Study window: arid thinking i’d 
A -.. had 
! 
[ 

had ’em about me, came out and forgot tern. This dishonourable Misfortune, you must believe, made my Heart broil with Vexation, like a Mutton chop upon a Gridiron. Now, thought I, I have brought my Hogs to a fair Market; what to Say, or do, or how to come off handsomely, to my Mistress under this shameful Disappointment, I know no more than a corn cutter. At last, I concluded, the best way was, to tell her the Truth of the matter; which, after as many Hums and Hates and Coughs and Spits, as a bashful Evidence makes before he Speaks to a Court of Judicature, I open’d my Sorrowful Cafe, but as awkardly as a Midwife talks Scripture, or a Priest Bawdy; upon which I found by her Looks, fly Seemed as much Surprised as I myself was daunted at the Accident. After a little Pause!! Sir, lays she, Since you have brought me out thus far from London., you’ll have the Honour to contrive Some way to convey me Safe home again: for indeed. Sir, says she, I did not take care fas I find, I ought to have done) to bring Money out with me, believing I could have no occasion for Expense in a gentleman’s Company, who has given me in Words such Aflurancesof his Friendship: To which I made her a Suitable Answer,

begging her she would remove al severe censures and Reflections, dioug’ justly cue to stich inexcusable Forgetful liess; nd that she Would be pleated t( tarry but a little time in atavern, till I step to a Friend at a Small distance from Ilamp tontownfiom whom I was astured of asup ply : She Seeming to be well Satisfied a what I propos’d, wc went accordingly in to a house, where I lest her over a Pint o Canary and a Roll.
