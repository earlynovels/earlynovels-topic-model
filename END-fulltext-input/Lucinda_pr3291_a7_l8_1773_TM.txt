Short Sketch of their amiable

Writer.
miss Courtney, then, is the only
Daughter of a Gentleman of good
Family, and genteel Fortune. My
first Acquaintance with her was
at a Boarding school, where we
contracted a Friendship, which
nothing but Dehth can difiblve;
at least I can answer for myself,
and have no reason to. doubt the
same of mv beloved Lucinda X for
•/
never Sure was there a more delicate, or more noble Heart than hers. Nature never put a brighter Gem into a more beautiful Casket. But I will not attempt to describe ei

there her Mind or person, since I feel myself unequal to the Talk. Let it Suffice, that, excepting your Ladyship, she comes the nearest to Perfection of any Creature I ever met with. I may be partial, but her Merit is universally ac
f
knowledged, though, perhaps, others may not think so highly of her as I do: Yet if they do not,
I
it must proceed from their not having the pleasure of knowing her so perfectly. I Shall never forget the happy Days, or rather Years, that we have pafsed together ', for we both continued much longer at School than is common. My Stay was prolonged by the Death of my dear Father, who left my Mother involved in Lawsuits
;

Suits i for which Reason she chose I Should continue where I was, till her Affairs were fettled; nor did I regret it. Since I was blessed ■ the Company of my Sweet Friend, whose Father, being a gay Man, was in no haste to recall her Home, justly Supposing, that a Daughter, who was remarkably tall of her Age, would not help the World to believe him the young man he 'desired to pass for; and Self-love is much more predominant in him, than paternal Affection. Indeed, no Man was ever less calculated for a Father and Husband, than Mr. Courtney and little was he worthy of a Lady, who was the Ornament of her Sex, and who merited more
B 3 than
J
i
r.

than all his tenderness, which he profusely lavished upon others. But his want of Affection was not all
V
'She had to complain of; his Extravagancies were daily exhausting their Fortune, and threatening them with Ruin j for, amongst his other Vices, he was passionately addicted to Gaming. Judge what Grief his Conduct must give a tender Mother, who had the well fare of her Child so much at Heart! Who justly doted on her Lucinda, yet Saw her in danger of being deprived of the Means of Supporting her Rank, and living up to the Hopes she was born' to! Hovr often did she press Mr, Courtney to permit her to return Horn, believing her presence and
amiable
■m

amiable Behaviour would excite his tenderness, and make, him a little more mindful of her Interest; but he always framed Some Pretence or other to delay it; and his Lady had no other consolation but that of visiting her, which she did very frequently; and it was greatly owing to her Letters and admirable Instructions, that my Friend is become Such an accomplished Woman.
There was an entire Freedom and Confidence between this amiable Parent and Child. Nothing could be more engaging than
their Behaviour to each other.
$
Mr. Courtney, on the contrary, was Satisfied with hearing her praises, without having curiosity
B 4 enough
I

enough to excite him to go himself and judge if she deserved them. He wrote to her. Sometimes, indeed, but that was all; yet this Neglect: did not diministi the Duty and respect miss Court’ '
r
ney knew file owed him as a Pa;; And She reluctantly Suf : fered herself to complain of his ijnkindness, even to me, from whom she never disguised her most Secret Thoughts.
As She found she must remain at School, she endeavoured to
s
profit by it. She applied to every kind of Learning, with Such afii duity, that never young Lady had a more finished Education; I mean Such as is Suitable to her Sex ', for, except reading more than is usual,
she

she aspired to nothing out of her Province, and Spoke no other Language than her own, excluding French, of which she was a perfect mistress. But what She most of all excelled in was Music and Dancing. I never saw any one have a more graceful Air in the latter, nor more Judgement and Execution in the former: To which I may add, one of the
m
✓
Sweetest Voices in the World. You may believe, by all this, we did not want for Amusement i and,, I must acknowledge, it was with Some Regret, that I at last received a Summons to return Home.
miss Courtney was inconsolable, and wrote to her Mother, entreat
B 5 ing

ing Permillion to leave the School at the same Time that I did; and begged her to press her Father for his consent. I likewise petitioned to wait till she had received an answer. In the mean Time we agreed, in order to Soften the Pain of absence, that we would keep up a regular Correspondence, and inform one another minutely, and by way of Journal, of everything that happened to us ^ for we feared we Should very seldom see each other, as my Father had taken a house a great • Distance from Town. In fettling this Plan we amused ourselves, till she received a Letter from Mr. Courtney, in which he granted her Request and her Mother informed
her.

her, she would fetch her the next Day. Great was her Joy at this Information, which was damped, however, when she reflected she was to part from me., I will not attempt to describe this Scene, as I have already exceeded the Bounds of a Letter, and, I fear, exhausted your Patience.
Upon looking over what I have wrote, I find it very confused and incorrect; but my Motives must plead for its Defects, since I did it to Satisfy your Curiosity, and obey your Commands.. I am, with great respect and Esteem, your Ladyfliip’si most obedient; Servant,

notwithstanding the Pleafiire T ^ I feel at my Return Home, my Spirits are opprefsed with Melancholy, at being deprived of the Company of my beloved Con jiantia. I feel your Embrace, and Seem still to See the friendly Tears you Shed for me. Alas! my con jiantia, when Shall we meet again?? I ever taste Such Pleasure, as I have done with you, where every Hour was crowned with Innocence and Peace? I am entering on a World which, those who have tried it, Say, is full of
misery
\

misery and Disappointment. I have, as yet, known none of its Cares, but now I look forward upon it with a kind of Dread; but whatever happens to me, whether Pleasure or Pain, will be heightened, or Softened, since my Friend permits me to communicate it to her. — Yes, my dear Conjiantia, I will with Pleasure keep the promise I made you; we will still eonverse, though at a Distance. Every Thought of my Heart Shall be open to her who So justly pofseffes my Affections.
Your Superior wisdom Shall still

direct, and make me more worthy of your Esteem. I have received the little outward Accomplishments of Education from othera,

but if I have real Merit, I must attribute it to your amiable Example. Remember your Lucinda, and be punctual in writing— — for myself, I am going to begin my Journal, according to our Agreement, and will take the Privilege you allow me, and be very minute, however trifling the in p cidents may be, which I may have to relate i knowing, that nothing will be uninteresting to a Friend, insipid as the Relation may appear tp others.
After parting with my confian tia, and the other agreeable young Ladies, with whom I had received my Education, I was conducted to my father’s; my Mind, during my Journey, agitated between
Grief

Grief and Joy. My dear Mother (who greatly esteems you) will forgive this Confession, since none but yourself could have prevented my being completely happy, while I was in her dear Company. After a pleasant Ride, we arrived at my long wished for Home. My Father was just gone out, but expected to return every Moment. I waited for him with a Mixture of Impatience and Fear. In the mean Time, the Servants crowded about me, and exprefsed their Joy at feeing me, especially the good old Margaret, whom you have often heard me mention as a faithful and affectionate Creature, and who has lived with my Mother ever Since she was a Child.
You

i
You may believe I felt great Pleasure at gaining my Freedom after a kind of banishment; but still, the Dread I had, lest my Father Should receive me ungraci ousty, hung upon my Heart, and weighed down my Spirits. My Mother kindly endeavoured to Sooth me and dissipate my Fears; Oh this dear Woman!
What a Blessing it is to have So in
#
a Parent! You, too, have an amiable Mother — Let us then be thankful, my Friend, and not repine at trifling Misfortunes, in Consideration of so great an hap pinefs.
As it was uncertain when my Father might return, I begged leave to retire to my Apartment,
where.
 7
where, mindful of my Conjiantia, I immediately took up my Pen. — Tell me, my Friend, is it a plea sant Place that your Mother has retired to? Favour me with a Description of it j Sure it must be much more delightful than this noisy town. Let me have an exact Account how you pafs your Time. — What are you doing now But I forget, you are but just returned, and you will be engaged in receiving the Congratulations of your Neighbours. I hope you will find Some of them agreeable, but do not let any of them rival me in your Friendship, I am as jealous as a Lover, in this respectbe civil and obliging to all, but love none but me; at
least.
i
least, not So well. Parents excepted : and then, and then only, you can come up to me in Affection, for you, have all that the Ties of Nature have left of my Heart; and should a Male Creature make pretensions to it, he must expect but to Share it with you; and if I find it too little to Satisfy both Love and Friendship, I would exclude the first, rather than part with the latter.
A Note is just brought from my Father — He cannot dine with us, but will be at Home in the Evening. I am sorry for it; I long for the pleasure of feeing him — -‘ How happy should I be, if I could believe he was equally impatient 1 ^biit, adieu, I am Sent for.

My Father is returned, and the Interview is over. I will not be particular, as I think he was not quite So kind as I could have wished— — hate to dwell on disagreeable Circumstances, especially when, by relating them, I must be obliged to Set my dear Parent in a Light less pleasing than I desire to introduce him to you. Time, and my Endeavours to please him, may produce happy Effects.
We had Company this Afternoon, but their Characters and Conversation were too common to deserve a Description — when I am Settled I will be more particular. I feel myself a little fatigued; it is almost Eleven o’clock, and Time to bid you good Night.

I am 'melancholy — My Father has been a little angry with me. After Some discourse with my Mother about Family Affairs, which made him peevish, he turned to me : You See the Plague of Matrimony, Said he j nothing
but Trouble and Expense attends

stand yet 111 warrant your light Head is giddy with high Expectations, and half wild for diffipa tion and Amusement, like other foolish Girls of your Rank, who think their Parents have nothing else to do with their Money but
to
 1
to give it to them to spend on their Pleasures; but you will find your self mistaken — The World may think what it pleases of my Circumstances, but I must tell you, you are not to flatter yourself with Expectations of a Fortune from me, and therefore behave accordingly.
You are tolerably handsome, and may, perhaps, get a Husband if you take Care s but the Duce is in all your foolish Sex, they never know their own Interest, they die if they are not seen; and So run from one public Place. to another, till their Faces become so common, that nobody will take the Trouble of looking at them. But let this house be the Sphere
of
22 thk HIST ORY of
of your Actions, added he, and try if you can kill the tedious Hours without gadding abroad.
Dear Sir, Said I, 1 am all sub mifiion to your Will. I hope my Behaviour, for the little Time I have been at Home, has not given Such Proofs of Levity, as to require a Lecture upon Prudence. Really, my pretty Miss, Said he, you have made a very womanly Speech ^ but harkee. Child, I would just hint to you, that you are not yet So over wise as to need no Instruction. I was Silent.
t
So you are Sulkey, Said he, pretty / Creature! but look here, leading me to the glass ', See what a Sweet Countenance you have to receive Company with — They
will,
1
 3 ill, doubtless, be delighted with
you..
Dear Sir, Said I, I beseech you to Spare your Raillery. I am not Sulkey — you have a right to treat me as you please. heyday!! he, you are a fine Gentlewoman truly! Treat you as I ' please! And pray Miss, may 1, presume to ask what Mnd of Treatment you would please to have? I warrant I have been very cruel to you, have not ibut pray go up to your Apartment, and try to get yourself drcfsed a little less frightfully.' I courtfied, and left him. I went to my Mother, who had quitted the room at the beginning of his discourse to me. I looked a little vexed,

I believe; for she asked me what was the the' Matter with me. Nothing, dear Madam, said I; only I think my Father is not near So well pleased with my Return as I could wish. You are mistaken. Said She j your not being acquainted with his Manner makes you think So. I am Sure he loves you; but he has a particular Turn, which you wdll Soon be accustomed to. Retort his Raillery; he is fond of Life and Spirits. You ^ must not look grave; be cheer ^ and ril answer for it you’ll ^ gain his Favour. But, dear Mai dam.

Time will wear off that Restraint, Said she; you must study his Temper. Really, Said I, he struck a Damp into me the, first Moment I Saw him — I had hardly
been a Minute in the house before he begun to find Fault wdth my dress and Manner. I never was accused of being inelegant in either, till I was So by the person 1 in the World I most desired to please. He only jested with you,
I Said my Mother; he wanted to I try your Temper : But go and !| put on your Clothes, and be as I unconstrained as you possibly can before the Company we expect I tonight. I make no doubt but I your Wit and good sense will re .lljstore you again to his Favour. I I vol. I. C fear.

fear, said I, what little Share I have (of what you are pleased to compliment me with) will appear to little Advantage under his scrutinising Eye; but I will do the best I can. So Saying, I repaired to my Toilet.
And now, my dear Conjiantia^ let me ask you, how you like this Specimen of my present Situation? I can tell you I am not doatingly fond of it. The Company we expect; tonight are Strangers to all the Family but my Father: : is very profuse in their praise, and says, he is Sure we must be happy in their Acquaintance. — But ' here thej come. Adieu, my Friend; I will

Miss Lucinda Courtney. ^7
give you my Opinion of them as Soon as they are gone.
My Father, with a Smiling Countenance, which he can ass

Slime when he plcases, flew to hand them from their Coach. Dear Ladies, Said he, I rejoice to See you. Mrs. Courtney is all Impatience to be introduced. He led them to us. This, Said he, is Mrs. Henley, whom you have heard me So justly praise, and this miss Henley, the Torment and pleasure of half the Men in Town. Why not all the Men, Said She, with a sprightly Air, to make your Compliment more complete Mr. Courtney, Said Major Freeman, (who came with them) was not aiming at a Come
2 pliment.
2  '
pliment, but only meant to give his Lady a true Idea of you. Oh,
t
your Servant, Said she. But come, Mr. Courtney, pray intro
I
duce the Major as well as me, ^
and give your Lady an Idea of, him, too. I leave' that for you, said my Father, as you know him best; and, indeed, I Should find |
j
Some Difficulty to describe him, ] Since he is always endeavouring; to be what you would have him; : and your Mind changes fb often, i that he is not the Same Man two j Minutes together. Oh, Wretch! ^ cried ^ stie, what an inconstant;
^ '. I
Creature have you made me! I

But don’t believe him. Madam, j turning to my Mother. Not if i you dislike the Character, said ■

fire; though I believe he meant it
as a Compliment. I did, indeed. Said my Father; for I am, Sure, in this Lady, at least, it is becoming. You are a flattering. Creature, Said She; but pray tell me, is this young Lady your Daughter? I protest She makes you an old. Man. I would advise you to shut her up, if you would wish to Shine as a gay Man of Gallantry i for in her presence I shall never be able to look upon you in any other Light than that of a reverend old Gentleman. Odious i said my Father; how can you mortify me foyou Should rather suppose the great Girl is my Sister. I intend to pafs her off as Such, I am Sure my youth
C full
it

full Looks will make the last much : easier believed than the former. Vain Wretch! Said Miss Henley, do, dear Mrs. Courtney, help me to lower his Pride. Tell me his Age; I am Sure he is at least as old again as you are. But pray observe the Major, continued She; he is examining Miss Courtney, to See if your Scheme is feasible. Vvhat Says your wisdom? Will file pass for his Sister, think you f I believe not, said the Major, (withdrawing his Eyes, which had, for Some Time, been tormenting me with their officious
J
Glances) She might much more ' easily be taken for Mrs. Courtney s, \ since She has a greater Resemblance? to that Lady. She is mine, never theless,
 1
vertheless, Said my Father, laughing, you Shall not make me doubt my Relation ship to her, nor would Mrs. Courtney be much obliged to you if you did.
Miss Henley did not Seem to relish the Attention that her Lover honoured me with. She tried to draw me into Conversation, not
J
doubting but she would Shine at my Expense, having So visibly the Advantage of me in modest as surance and sprightliness.
Aie you not happy, Miss, Said fire, to be delivered from the Confinement of a Boarding school.? I am Sure I was like a Bird escaped from a Cage, when I was released from one; and, I believe, my governess was no
C 4 less
*
I
3  |
less pleased than myself; for 11 took a most unaccountable Delight | in mischief, and played a' thousand unluckly Tricks, to torment the good Lady Abbess. I must |
i
own myself a little deficient in f that Part of my Education, Said Id. it was Want of Spirits, I suppose, I but, I confess, I aimed more to be the best Scholar, than, wittily, to signalise myself as the best Romp. Oh, your Servant, Sweet Miss, said file; but, ' take ray Word for it. Life and Spirits will' make a better Figure in the Beau Monde, than grave Stupidity, with all the Learning of a College.
i
I hope. Madam, Said I, Gravity! and Stupidity are not Synonymous; Terms? Very nearly fb, in my;
Opinion,
,  3
Opinion, said miss Henley. True, Said my Father; what have Women to do with Learning? Their Heads are not formed for it. A wife. Woman is an absurdity. All She" ought to aim at is, to be lively and entertaining. I would not give a rush for a. Woman, who is dully uniform and reasonable. Little, volatile inconfisten cies are their greatest Charms: It is these which distinguish them from the more Solid Sex. They deviate from Nature,, when they endeavour at Excellencies that were never designed for them. I leave the Ladies to thank you for the pretty Compliment you have paid them, said the Major t but I have the Honour to differ with you in
C C my
»
%
3 ,
my Ideas of an accomplifiied Woman. I allow, indeed, that un
\
meaning Vivacity may make Some Figure at an ajfemlily, but com)
)
me to good Sense for a the a tete. That is, said Miss Henley, you would prefer a Prude in private, to a Coquet, because those Ladies are generally more liberal of their Favours. But vive la bagatelle, say I; none of your Sententious People for my Money. In my Opinion, Said I, a Woman cannot be a true, refined Coquet, without a great Share of sense. This Character would not be So ridiculous, if we did not So often see it attempted by those who have no Talents for it. I admire ' a Woman who has Wit enough
to
r
 5
to be one, but too much Prudence to chuse So light a behahaviour. I do not, more than you,. ■ love grave Formality r yet, I own, I prefer it to brisk, insipid Folly.. Upon my Honour, .Miss, Said the Major, you have Wit and sense enough to be what you please; I 
blushed at this blunt Compliment,,
\
and observed miss Henley bit her Lips and bridled; but she endeavoured to hide her Chagrin, by turning carelessly to my Father,, to whom. She whispered Something,, at which they both affected to laugh very heartily. My Mother endeavoured to render the conversation more general..
And now, that the lively Miss ilmley would give her Sister Time
C 6.. to
t
3
, to be heard, I found her a most agreeable Woman, and really believe I shall have a great Regard for her, when we are a little more intimate. She told me,, she Should esteem it a Favour if t would permit her to attend me to Some of the public Entertainments. She was Sure, She was pleased to say, that the Remarks, a young Lady of my good. sense. would make on them,, would give, a Relish to what Custom had made almost
V
insipid to her. I bowed in Acknowledgement of so high a
V
Compliment. The Major told Mrs. Henley,, he must put in Sora Share of her happiness,, and pror posed oui going, to the Play the very next Evening, My Mother
obi e died
 7
objected to it, as She happened to be engaged, and, I believe, did not much approve of my going with' ' her; but as the Ladies did not
I
Seem willing to postpone their pleasure, my Father gave his consent that I should go, though neither he nor my Mother could attend us. It was accordingly determined that I Should drink Tea with Mrs.. Henley., and. accom» pany them to the Theatre. They fbon. after took their Leave,, and my Father, continuingdn a pretty good-humour, favoured us with Some Particulars of their hisr tory.
Mrs. Henley,, it seems, is a Widow of good Fortune, and without Children she has, therefore.
\

fore, desired her Sister to live with her, which is very agreeable! to the other, as her Fortune would not enable her Separately to maintain that Rank in Life which she is fond of. Mrs. Henley is | determined against a Second Marriage, and that,, partly on her sister’s Account, for She has a. great Regard for her.. Indeed, this young Lady is not void of Merit, though she is, I think, a little too sensible of her Perfections. Her Face is not what one. can call pretty, but all together She may pafs for a fine, Ihowy Woman. Her Air is quite degagee,. and she is very lively and chatty..;
r
The Men are fond of her Company, and She is generally adinired.

The Major, it Seems, is looked upon as her Captive, by hersels, and most of her Acquaintance, though he has not yet been very explicit on the Subject:. But now for the Major; though last, not least beloved, nor, in Justice, he ought not, since he took no Small Pains to recommend himself to me, though, good Man, he has been rather unsuccessfui — But here’s his pi6hire.
In the first Place, he is tall, and, what Some People would Say,, genteel His Face, indeed, is rather plain; but Sora Man, you know, that is not of much consequence. He is, all together, a good manly Figure, and, I suppose, has his Admirers, tho’, I believe, I shall never
add

add to the Number. His Estate, is but Small, but he has great Expectations, as his Brother, ' Sir William Freeman, is unmarried, and in a. bad State of Health.
i
I
After my Father had thus, made' us a little acquainted with the Hi
i ^ j
story of our new Friends, he honoured me with some Instructions as to my Behaviour in public, in which he took Occasion to be a
..A ^
little satirical on us poor Females, though the amiable and prudent j Conduct of my Mother, ought to | have given him a better Opinion | of the Sex T but the gay Part of I Mankind converse too much with j the abandoned Part of the Wo j men, to do Justice to the truly j virtuous., I wonder the Ladies j

Should ever have any partial Favour for Rakes, who, of all their Species, are least apt to esteem them, because they are most sen fible of their Frailties. — But let me take Care that I am not caught tomorrow Night, by one ox those Specious Animals.
Between you and I, I do not think the Stage one of the most innocent Diversions' ' have read a great Number of Plays, and tho’ I do not like some rigid people’s
condemning them all without dis

tinction, we must allow, there are Numbers of them that have no very good Effect: upon the Morals. They are Said to be our most rational amusement, and the Stage is thought, by Some of
. its

its Advocates, to be more conducive to our Reformation than even the Church, as Example goes farther than Precept but let us judge of the Effects. We 1

It is rather late in the Year to expect: much Company at the playhouse; though the People Seem every Year less fond of leaving the dear Town, and do not quit it for the Country, ’till almost half the Summer is over. I wonder at their Taste; for London, in warm, dusty Weather, is, in my Opi

But pray. Sir, let us mind the Play; talking now is a little un feasonable. So Saying, I turned to the Stage, and continued attentive till it was over.
The Major gave his Hand to Mrs. Henley, to conduct her to her Chair; I followed them but just as I was stepping out of the Box, I Saw Lord Cleaveland standing, as if waiting for Somebody. He accosted the Major with great Freedom and politeness; and I judged, by their

Subject; all which we had heard a thousand Times before, and could have dispensed with the Repetition of. During all this interesting Discourse, I had been an humble Hearer; for in vain I ransack’d my Memory, to find Some Wonder of the Same kind to repeat, but I had none: However, loth to be thought dumb, I joined the general Chorus of — amazing! — wonderful!' — and other Exclamations of Surprise, that were uttered at the Eild of every Tale.

I NEVER go to Mrs. Henley s, but I meet Lord Cleaveland. I begin to think he really has a ten drejj'e for Miss Henley -, why, else, is he perpetually there.? He has never shown anv inclination 'to visit me; and indeed, I am sincerely
J
glad of it. I do not wish to be distinguished by what he calls his Love, as his Character is too abandoned to expect any Good from Such a Conquest. He pro festes, however, a great friend strip for me, and bn the Strength of it,, has, in a delicate Manner,.

he likewiie. profefses to have a ' great Esteem. I was not willing I to. Satisfy his Curiosity, and in f stead of leading him to the Truth, [ gave him some reason to believe [ I had a Partiality for that Gentle 1 man. He has watched my Behaviour very narrowly ever since, as well as the major’s; but for no other reason, I really believe, than to know if I was Sincere, wten I Spoke favourably of him. My Swain and he are Sometimes at cross purposes -, but my Lord, after Saying Some Things a little Severe, upon his person or Wit, always turns it off wdth a Joke, declaring, he means nothing by
his

his Raillery but to give the Major

an Opportunity (by retorting it) of fhewdng his Smartnefs before
his mistress. .1 don’t, know how
/
he likes it, but I am Sure he has no great reason to be pleased, Since his Lord, Ship has manifestly the Advantage of him in Life and Spirits; for the major’s Sense, good Man, consists chiefly in the Solids, which my Mother tells me, however, is preferable to all others.
Do you not think. Said she, that a grave. Sober Man makes a better Figure, as the Head of a Family, than a laughing Trister, or even a Satirical Wit, who will perhaps defpise his Wife for want of Smartnefs, and treat his Children '

I found the hated Lord Cleaveland
at Mrs. Henley s his Eyes
\
Sparkled with odious Joy, as Soon as he Saw me, which I took but little Notice of at that Time; but can now, but too well, account for. Miss Henley was in high Spirits, which my Lord kept up, by a Number of Compliments, which confirmed her in the good Opinion she already had of her Charms. She made no Doubt of her having made a Conquest of him, and Seemed to pity my being, as stie supposed, greatly mortified at his Neglect: yet she was much mistaken, '

taken, for I was perfectly easy about the Matter. He continued his Astiduities to her, and when we were going, led her to her Chair. All the Time of the o pera she Seemed to engross his whole Attention 5 So that I really was convinced he liked her. Artful Villain! how fatally did he make me suffer for my Credulity! When the odious Opera was over, he again gave her his Hand. I had brought no Servant with me, but Mrs. Henley s had received Orders to get three Chairs for us, against our coming out. But when that Lady and her Sister had got into theirs, he told me, he had in vain endeavoured to get another, but found them all engaged I

There was a great Crowd about us, and I was ashamed to stand any longer in the Street. While I was waving and irresolute, my Lord took my Hand and hurried me into his Carriage, and Seated himself by me. For Some Time I condemned my needless Scruples, as I then thought them, for his

Sleep had but just buried the Remembrance of my miseries, when I was awakened with a N oise I at my Window, which I heard [ thrown open, and, soon after, Somebody came Softly towards my Bed with a Lantern. Judge of my inexprestible Fears! I Shrunk under the bedclothes, and gave myself up for lost. The person opened the Curtains and took my Watch from the Head of the Bed. Dreadful as my Situation was, I [ felt a Gleam of Joy, thus convinced that it was not Lord Cleaveland, wtom I, a Moment be | imagined it to be. I lay j
half
 33
half dead, hardly daring to breathe. The Robber, having secured my Watch, looked about for my Pockets. In taking them from under my Head, he uncovered my Face, and held the Lantern to it, to examine if I was still asteep. Frightened to Death, imagining he was going to murder me, I opened my eyes; and, clasping my Hands together. Spare me, dear, good Sir, said I, Spare my Life, I will give you no Disturbance. The Man drew out a Knife. Make no noise, then, said he, or you are a dead Woman. He then left me, and unbolted j my Room Door, and going to the I Window another Villain got into ji my Chamber, who was to watch I me.
13  I
me while the first went so rob the rest of the house. Dreadful i was my Situation : I' fervently invoked the Protection of Heaven. The Man stood by the Window with a Knife in his Hand, as I could See by the Light of the Moon, which Shone very bright. He Sometimes went Softly to the Door, as if impatient for the Return of his Companion. But how terribly were my Fears augmented, when I heard a great Noise and Disturbance, and Several Voices calling out. Thieves 1 I expected nothing now but to be murdered by the Villain who was
X
in my Apartment, out of Revenge | for his Disappointment; but I was happily deceived: He thought
of
 35
of nothing but making his escape -, and, with all imaginable Haste, got out again at the Window, My Heart overflowed wdth Gratitude to Heaven for my Deliverance; but, alas! my misery was not yet at an End. I had just got up to Secure my Door till I could put on my Clothes, with an Intention to go down and know how this Shocking Affair had ended, when Lord Cleaveland rustled into my Room. He caught me in his Arms, naked as I was. I Screamed with all my Force, and struggled to disengage myself. Are you, then. Safe, my lovely, my adorable Lucinda? How terrible have been my Apprehensions on your Account! '
But
I
13
I
But dismiss your Fears, my Love; i
[
i the Villains are gone. Are they? said I; — what, then, are you?' Your Adorer, your Friend, said he, prefiing me closer to his Breast. Rage and Indignation gave me Strength. Vile and detested Monster, cried I, kill me; but do not. Oh! do not proceed in your abominable Design. Save me, good Heavens, Screamed I, finding him still perfist in taking more Liberties; will no one come
t I
to, my Afiistance? Oh! Mercy, dear good Sir. I will have Mer ■ my best beloved. Said he; but yield, yield, my Charmer, and be entitled to it. Oh! I am — A Villain, Said I y and exerting myself with, redoubled Force,
Sprung
\
 37
Sprung from him, and flew to the Window, which was still open, with a Design to cast myself out of it. He hastily followed, and caught hold of me.
I clung by the casement. He conjured me to get down again. Swearing, by all that is good and Sacred, he would. offer no farther rudeness, but leave the Room, as Soon as he was assured I would not proceed in my dreadful Design. Forgive, adorable Lucinda, cried he, what the Sight of your Charms and the madness of my Pafiion have made me act. I had no Design of offending your Delicacy, when I entered your Chamber I came only to inquire aster your Safety.
I re
13
I repent of my Folly, and thus, on my Knees, (falling on the Window seat, ffill holding me) thus penitent, for my involuntary j Crime, I implore your Pardon. Leave me. Screamed I, leave me;
r ■' I,
let me never more be forced to behold Such a Monster. Do not, said he, wdth Emotion, do not provoke me to take Revenge for your unjust Hate. Unjust! my Lord, said I; but why do I condescend to expostulate with Such a Wretch? Tis well. Madam, j Said he, in a Rage y but remember, you are still in my Power. I You could not treat me worse if I I had jufdfied your Anger. Why | will you exaiperate me? Have I not acknowledged my Fault? Will
nothing
(
I
 39
nothing plead in my Favour? The Time, your Situation, all conspired to put me off my Guard. This is the first: Time I, have ever given you cause to complain of my Behaviour; and I Swear, by Heaven, it Shall be the last:. I put no Confidence in your Promises, said I; but thus (Snatching up the Knife which the Robber had dropped, and which, just: then, I had the good Fortune to See) thus am I armed against: your vil lany. I now got down from my uneasy Situation, and his Lord ihip retired to Some Distance.
Do you think. Said he, that you could defend yourself from me, if I really had a Design to injure you I Vain Confidence!
I • no.
/
14
no, my too cruel Lucinda, believe me, you deceive yourself. That murderous Weapon could not intimidate me, if I had not before determined to act like a Man of Honour. But moderate, dear Creature, moderate your displeasure, -, let me, before I force myself from your presence, ' receive Some little Hopes of Pardon, to Save me from despair. Once more, on my Knees, I kn plore your forgiveness. Leave me. my Lord, Said I, leave me —
a Flood of Tears deprived me of
«
Power to add any more. He arose and approached me. Do not, ah! do not weep, my lu citida, cried he -, you wring my Heart, to see you thus afflict
yourself.
 41
yourself. Come no nearer, at your Peril, Said I. Vain i Threats! Said he, I Sear neither
I ^ '
Wounds nor Death; nothing but the Continuance of your difplea fure. Well, Sir, Said I, leave me, and I will try to forget what is past. Heaven reward you for this condefcension, he cried y I will leave you. Since you command it, henceforth you Shall govern me as you think proper. Never more will I offend my Sweet Lucinda.
So Saying, he went from me y but,
■ \
before he left the Room, conjured me to compose myself and take some Rest.
As Soon as he was gone, I Sell on my Knees, and poured out my Gratitude to Heaven, for my
escape
14
escape from Such imminent Danger. I then put on my Clothes, and, finding myself very faint and ill, ' drank Some Water, and then, unable either to sit or stand, I Sunk down by the Side of my Bed, laying my Arms across upon it, and my Head upon them, and in i this Posture, I Spent the rest of ' the Night, in an Agony of Mind impossible to be expressed. I had ^ some momentary Slumbers, but always waked from them • in Terror and Affiight..
In the Morning the housekeeper came into the Room, for I had forgot to bolt the Door.
I lifted my Head on her Entrance, but resumed my former Posture, when I saw who it was. Dear
Lady,
/
 43
Lady, Said she, let me beseech
you to rise and take Some Refresh'
'
My Lord fears you are too much discomposed, with your last night’s Fright, to hope for the pleasure of your Company in the Parlour. To be Sure I was I almost terrified to Death myself; and the Villain has wounded one of the Footmen in Such a Manner, that I question if he ever gets the better of it. They were desperate Fellows, that’s to be certain. They have broke open the Garden Gate. It was a Mercy we were not all murdered. To be Sure, I hate these houses that Hand So nigh the Fields. See, here, Madam, is the Ladder still Handing that they got in at the
Window
14
Window with. I made no Answer to this Harangue, but continued in the Same Posture. Come, dear Madam, Said ihe, pray let me help you to get up; if you won’t, I must call my Lord. To be certain you will make yourself Sick, if you fret So, and eat nothing. I got up, terrified lest She should do as She Said. I charge you not to call your maf ter. Said I, I want to be alone — You will oblige me, if you will leave me. I dare not. Madam, Said She, till I have Seen you take your breaksast my Lord would half murder me, if I should disobey him. Teasing Woman! thought I. Give me a Dish of Tea, Since it must be So.. I care not
what
 45
what I do. She brought me Some immediately, and again began prating about the Robbers. I was heartily glad when I got rid of her, which was not till she had, in a manner, forced me to eat.
When she was gone, I bolted my Door, and Sat down to write to my Confiantia. This consolation is still left me; but, alas! though I write, my Friend is ignorant of my dreadful Situation! — When I shall be permitted to convey my Letters to her. Heaven knows y but if it is not Soon, Death will be my Deliverer. I hear the Company are come, ’ that the detested Man told me he expected. They are in the Room next the Street. Oh, that I vol. I. H could
\
14
could get out at the Garden, while my Jaylor is otherwise engaged! — but impossible— — - Gardener is continually upon the Watch. Wretched Lucinda! what will become of you I I must lay down my Pen — I am So fatigued both in Body and Mind, that I can write no more. — I must lie down — Adieu — Do you not pity your wretched Friend?
I find myself Something better. I think I will venture to
r;
take a little Airing in the Garden.
I See there is no person there. The Company, I believe, have
/
not yet finished their Dinner. The officious Woman has again been tormenting me to eat. The
Cloth
 47
Cloth was laid in my own a partment, wtere I was attended with great respect y but I had no Appetite, as you may Suppose; however, thank Heaven, the dis agreeable Ceremony is over, and now I will take my disconsolate Walk. Adieu.
Oh my Conjiantia! rejoice with your Lucinda! I have Some Hopes of escaping!! Some Turns in the Garden, I was going again to enter the detested house, when, ' in crolsmg a Walk, I met a young Gentleman of a most amiable Appearance. His person was lovely beyond description, and his Face wore Such visible Marks of gopd ness and Humanity, that I in
H 2 stantly
V
I,.
14
stantly resolved to implore his Afv ' Sistance and Protection. I flung myself at his Feet, and, with great Fervour, conjured him to pity and deliver me from a Place where I was forcibly detained. He gazed at me with Astonishment, raised me with great sweet ness, and declared his Readiness to Serve me to the utmost of his Power. Oh, generous Sir, said I, contrive someway for me to make my escape from this detested house, and Heaven will reward the noble Action. I will. Said he, charming Creature I I will do it, though I should lose my Life in the Attempt. Beware, Said I, dear Sir, of exposing either yourself or me. It must be accomplifiied
I  49
plistied by Stratagem, not Force. — I would not, ' for the World, endanger my Protector. I have thought of a Method, said he, after a pause. This Night, if Heaven'permit, I will convey you to a Place of Safety. Be ready,, i and expect me, at one in the Morning. I will provide rope i Ladders, and everything neces fary to effect our Purpose. Depend upon the Honour of him you have ventured to put Confidence in • — you shall never have reason to repent it. — I shall not rest till I have convinced you how readily, I would Sacrifice everything, rather than not deliver you. I lifted up my Hands and Eyes to Heaven in Prayer for

his success, and blefied him for his goodness; but he put me in Mind that it was not Safe for us to talk any longer, lest any per fon Should Surprise us, and frustrate our Scheme. Fear nothing, Said he, dear Lady, but trust to my Care and Fidelity. He bowed respectfully, and I returned to my Apartment, half wild with Joy.
, Oh my Conjiantia, this Night, how different will it, I hope, be, from the preceding one I Heaven grant I may not be disappointed! Sure this charming Youth is Some Angel Sent for my Deliverer. I can hardly Support my Joy. If I must again See this detested Lord, I will Submit to
play
 51
play the Hypocrite, that I may lull him into Security. I must: endeavour to conceal my Hatred of him, lest he stiould again form some Stratagem to undo me. I shall not long, I hope, be under a Necessity of acting So contrary to my Nature. When will this tedious Day be over ^ Never did any one before appear so long. The Company are not yet gone. — Heaven grant my new Friend may not forget his promise! Yet it is unjust to suspect him — his Face is the Emblem of everything that is great and good. — Hark 1 I hear them going. — > Heaven guard my Protector!
My Lord has Sent to' beg I would honour him with my
H 4 Com
15
Company, only for a few Mi
/
he Says. I go • — I will not refuse, lest I Should exasperate him. Yet my Heart rises at the
4
Thought of feeing him but I must put a Constraint upon myself.
My Lord is in Ecstasy at my Behaviour. I have given him Hopes that he is forgiven his vile Attempt. He even talked Something about Marriage^swore I had almost reconciled him to what he thought he never could have Submitted to. I Seemed to listen with pleasure. — He prevailed on me to play on the Harpsichord. Never Man poured forth Such a Profusion of Raptures. He raved at himself, for‘
ever
I
^  53
ever having dared to offer rudeness to Such Merit and Virtue; and promised and Swore never to give me any more cause of uneafiness. In this Manner we pasted the Time till the Clock struck Eleven. I then begged him to permit me to retire, as/i found myself greatly indisposed by the Disturbance I had Suffered the Night past. He reluctantly Suffered me to go, but not till I had permitted him to kifs my Hand, in Token of our Reconciliation. I then wished him a good Night, and flew to my Apartment, where I am now impatiently waiting for the happy Hour that I am to expect my Deliverer. — Sure it will never come! — I look out at the
H 5 Window
15
Window every Minute. — Hark, I hear a noise — ’tis him! — ’tis my Guardian Angel 1 I must: put up all my Writings, and attend him. Adieu.
How Shall I express my Joy! I am, dear Conjiantia, at last: in a Place of Safety. Heavens reward my dear, my amiable Protector! But let me tell you the Particulars of my escape.
As Soon as I Saw the lovely Youth, I took up the Candle, and stole Softly down to the back Door that opens into the Garden; but what was my Terror and Disappointment, to find it locked, and the Key taken out! I was ready to fink with Fear and Grief., The young Gentleman
rapped
i
 55
rapped at it, to let me know he was there. I, in a Whisper through the keyhole, told him I could not open it. No Matter, Said he, I have provided against: this Accident; Return to your Apartment, and I will fling up a Rope ladder, on which you may descend without Danger. My Spirits recovered. I again stole to my Room, and held my Hands out at the Window to receive it; but my too great eagerness, for Some Time, prevented me from catching it -, however, I persevered, and at last was so happy as to get hold of it. I immediately fastened it to the Window, and got down y my Deliverer received me at the Foot of it. I could not
H 6 Support
15
Support myself, so great was my Agitation; I wms forced to lean upon his Arm. He Soothed me,
and congratulated me on my E
/
with inexprestible tenderness both of Voice and Manner.
I found he had kroke open the Garden Gate, so we had no more Difficulties to encounter. His Chariot was ready .in the Fields to receive us 3 he lifted me into it, and we drove off. But what the Situation of my Mind was, on this happy Occaston, is impossible to be described. My Gratitude to the young Gentleman was, unbounded, but exprelfed in almost unintelligible Words — he would hardly suffer me to thank him. I have done nothing but what every '
Man

Man of Honour, in my Situation, would do. Said he, and can claim no \ Merit or praise for what was only! my Drity. I rejoice that Heaven has made me an Instrument to succour So much Innocence and Beauty. I am, continued he,
1 conducting my lovely Charge to the house of a Lady, who will. esteem herself happy in having such a Guest. She is my Aunt, and a most valuable Woman. I have acquainted her with my Scheme for your Deliverance, and Ihe is all Impatience for the success of it, and will rejoice wten I
present you to her. We are, I see, almost at her Door. In a Minute, the Carriage stopped y my Conductor led me to this amiable

\

i
15
miable Lady, who received me, in the moult polite and friendly Manner. I was So overwhelmed with pleasure and Gratitude, that
I lost the Power of Utterance,
/ <
and could only express the Sense I had of their goodness by my ' Tears. I was delighted with her graceful and winning Deportment, and She declared herself no less so with, me. Mr. Montague (for that is the Name of my noble Deliverer) begged we would postpone all farther Compliments till the next Morning. My charming Ward, said he, has great need of Rest, and I imagine none of us will be the worse for ip tomorrow, we Shall again, I hope, have the happiness of Seeing
 59
;
ing each other, and may then express our mutual Approbation, i The Lady agreed to his proposal,
^ and politely led me to my Apartment, wdiere She willied me re frelliment after my Fatigue, and
left me -- -- but not to Sleep, I
i could not close my Eyes. Joy now produced the Same Effect in me, as Sorrow had done before. So that I hardly Slumbered till about Eight in the Morning, and then. Nature being quite exhausted, I fell into a profound Sleep, from which I did not awake till almost Twelve.
I arose, half ashamed of my laziness, and was preparing to go downstairs, when a Servant came to dress me. I inquired if
her
io The HISTORY of
her Lady was stirring? Yes. Madam, Said She, and has Sent me to
».
know if you chuse to rise, or have your Breakfast Sent here. Lead me to her, said I, I hope I have not made her wait? No, she replied, neither She, nor my Master have been up a Quarter of an, Hour, though they did not use to be So late.
I followed her into the Parlour, where I found the dear Lady and my amiable Deliverer. Never did I See So handsome a Youth. I cannot describe his person, he is So inexprellibly lovely. Such a Face. Such Eyes and Teeth 1 Oh my Confiantia 1 and Such a Voice and Manner!
^, After
I Miss Lucinda Courtney. ii
After the first Compliments were over, I related some Particulars of my unhappy Adventure,
and who I was. Mrs. lvilliams (for that is the Name of my dear protectress) made me high Encomiums on my Conduct in So = dreadful a Situation, and exprested,
'very feelingly, the just Detestation Ihe had for so vile a Character as that of Lord Cleaveland, but I cannot describe the virtuous in dignation that Sparkled in the fine Eyes of my Deliverer. He often interrupted me with Exclamations of Pity and Surprise, during my
I
Recital. I blush, Said he, (when I left Speaking) for my Sex. What Opinion must you have formed of us, from such an Example!

and what Idea can you have of ' me, whom you have found to be of his Acquaintance Oh, Sir, said I, your Behaviour has convinced me of the wide Difference there is between you. Had this vile Lord many Such afsociates as yourself, one might hope in Time j, to see him reformed: But I can = think you have known him long; his Intimates, if I mistake not, are of a very different Character. He bowed, gracefully, a Return to my Compliment. I think myself happy. Madam, in your good Opinion, but your a miable Gratitude makes you willing to think well of one who has been; so fortunate as to render you an inconsiderable Service; yet

i 63
I hope a farther Acquaintance will. ‘ not give you cause to change these;; Sentiments y at least, i it shall be my Study to deserve your Approbation, since I already feel I Shall be miserable without it. He stopped, and Seemed to I think he had Said too much, for he appeared in Some little Con i fusion. Why did he stop.? and why his Emotions? Ah! take I Care, my Heart, that you do not I! put a wrong Construction on! them, and vainly flatter yourself ^ with delusive Hopes! — But what

And yet I am very differently af,, in the Company of this Man from what I ever was in that;

. Mrs. Williams asked me if it would not be proper to send for my Mother here, rather than for me to go Home -, because, Said she, Mrs. Courtney can then inform you of what has ’ pafsed in your absence, and instruct you how to behave, to prevent giving any j Suspicion: besides, your Emotions, at So happy a Meeting, could hardly be concealed from
Some
I  65
some of the Family, who would, doubtless, be surprised at it. Here you may act: without Constraint, and I stiall partake of the joyful Interview. How Shall I find Words to thank you, my dear Madam, said I, for So kindly interesting yourself in what concerns me? I entirely acquiesce in your j Reasons for my mother’s coming here, and will write a Note to inform her of my Deliverance, and of the generous Protection I have
1
met with, which you will permit one of your Servants to carry to her. That Servant shall be my,, Said the obliging Mr. Mon i faille', you must not discard me from your. Service, till you have fostered me to give Proofs of my
Diligence

Diligence and Fidelity, in obeying your Commands. You have told me where Mr. Courtney lives, I will order my. Chariot immediately, and bring your Mother to you. I Shall tell her, continued ' he. Smiling, that I will put her in a Way to recover the Jewel fly was robbed of, but that the Thief is already Sufficiently punished, in being obliged to restore his ill-gotten treasure. I Shall likewise caution her, to guard it with double Diligence, Since the Temptation is almost too powerful to be resisted. He rang the Bell, and gave Orders for the Carriage to be got ready.
You may believe I was not backward, in expressing the Sense
I had
i'
' 67
Iliad of the Obligations they were continually laying me under. You
V
think too highly of such trifling Favours, Said Mr. Montague y your having so lately conversed with ^ one, who had no sense of good nefs, makes you magnify every
1 common Civility, into an heroic Ad of Virtue. You know not
I
j how fervently I wish your happiness, and would to Heaven it were in my Power to testify the Reverence and Attachment I feel, for Such uncommon Merit and Beauty. But I See the Chariot is at the Door. I go, my dear Miss Courtney, to bring you one who will make you happier than all my Professions of Esteem. He bowed, and left us. T never
saw
i6
1
Saw anybody make So elegant, So genteel a Bow; but, indeed, his
whole address is uncommonly graceful and easy. I Shall be undone if I see him often. When he was gone, I begged Mrs. Williams s Leave to retire to my Chamber, as I found myself a little in *
I am better y and now resume my Pen, to inform my Conjiantia of the happy Change in my Situation.
What, my dear, will be my Emotions, when Mr. Montague returns with my beloved Mother!
I cannot Settle a Moment in a Place; I lay down my Pen every Instant, to look if they are coming
 69
ing. Are you not charmed with my agreeable new Friends? And do you not fear that I Shall be too much so ^ with ^ne of them at least? — I hope you need not. The Chariot is returned. — — Oh, my dear Mother! I come! I \ come!
Asiain I sit down to wnite.
O
I Thank Heaven I shall Soon be
j at Home! -- How much will
my late Troubles endeai* it to me! All the little uneasinefies I have suffered there, appear nothing, when I compare them with wdiat, I have been delivered from. But you expect me to be particular.
When I Saw my dear Mother alight, and led into the house by my graceful Deliverer, I flew to
vol. I. I meet
17  ' meet her— — received me in her
Arms. Our first: Transports were
too great for Words -- -- -- Tears of
Joy relieved us. I then inquired after my dear Father. The amiable Mrs. Williams, and her Nephew, Seemed to partake in the pleasure of this happy Meeting.
After my Story had been told, we were a little composed. My Mother turned to them, and, in very high Terms, exprefsed her Gratitude for, the Protection they had granted me, as well as for Mr. Montagues uncommon goodness in my Deliverance. If you, think we have been so happy as to render you any Service, Said the obliging Mrs. Williatns, let
me
/
 71
me claim,, as an ample Return, j the pleasure of your Friendship, i and that of your lovely Daughter. That will be still adding' to or Debt, said my Mother; however, I, with pleasure, agree to your obliging Request.
* While they were Speaking, I ventured to look at Mr. Montague, and found his Eyes fixed on! my Face, but with an Air of Melancholy, which, I cannot account
for -- he sighed too -- Why did
he Sigh— — what’s the Mat i ter with me, my Friend.? Why this exact Scrutiny into his beha i s viour? don’t laugh at me, for > I begin to fear I shall deserve your 1 Pity, should I foolishly give up t I my Freedom to one, who, per s I 2 haps.
•v
17
haps, cannot -- and what is worse,
may be — does not think of me in any other Light but that of Friend' '? But I will not dwell on this disagreeable Subject— — is too humbling.
Just as I was preparing to go, and Mr. Montague had taken
• my mother’s Hand to lead her to his Chariot (whivdi was to carry
• us home) I was Seized with a giddiness, that obliged me to hurry to a Chair, to prevent my falling, Mr. Montague observed my illness, and flew to Support me, Mrs. Williams applied her Smelling bottle, but without Effect. My kind Deliverer held me up in his Arms with great tenderness, into which I fell
without
 73
without sense or Motion. I recovered a little, as he was carry 1 ing me up to my Apartment, my Mother and Mrs. Williams following us. I, faintly, not being able to speak distinctly, ex preited my Concern at the Trou i ble I gave him to which he made me no answer, but pressed me closer to his Breast, and i sighed. When we got into my Room, he laid me gently on the Bed, and respectfully with i drew.

We will acquaint Mr. Courtney with the reason of his not feeing you fb Soon as he expected y perhaps he will Savour

My Lucinda Snail accept of your kind Offer y and as soon as I see her a little more composed, I will, myself, return to Mr. Courtney, and
inform,

inform him of her illness -, and, in the Afternoon, with your I Permillion, will again be your Guest. For heaven’s Sake, cried Mrs. lvilliams, Smiling, let us have no more to do with Cere —

, I fear to talk to you. Said my
I
dear Mother (when Mrs. Williams was gone) in the Condition you are in : I believe it will be better to defer it, till you are

17
more perfectly recovered. No, dear Madam, cried I, I beseech you to Satisfy my curiosity a little; I am impatient to know what has pasted during my absence. I am well — I think I can bear it without being discomposed. Tell me, did my Father See Mr. Montague? — > How did he receive him? — ■ I stopped — Why was this the first Question I He did not. Said my Mother your Father was not at home, though I wish he had Seen, that he might have helped me to thank him for his goodness. Not at home! Deal’ Madam, cried I, interrupting her; then he knows nothing of my Deliverance., Yes, replied ' my
 77
N
my Mother, I left a Note to acquaint him with it, and likewise that I was gone to fetch, you. I am glad of that. Said I, ^ he will then be prepared to rer ceive me, and I hope, not uni kindly.. Yet I both dread and I wish for the Interview., You i know his Temper, my Dear,.
Said my Mother; he has, been ex j cefiively uneasy at your unhappy Adventure; yet,, doubt not, but the Joy of your Return will overcome his Anger.. Ah! Ma

Mrs. Henley, her sis ter, and Major Freeman have called almost: every Day to know if you were returned. I excused myself from Seeing them, on account of my Health. You know I was not well the Night you went to that fatal Opera -, and

I tried to Sleep, but in vainj a thousand Thoughts, pleasing and yet painful, crowded upon my Mind, and my Deliverer
had but too great a Share in them. After Dinner, my Mother paid us another Visit, and was delighted to find me So composed and well. She told me, my Father wished to receive me at his own house, rather than where I was; for which reason he had Sent an Apology to Mrs. Williams, for not waiting on her

I at the Same Time, very politely

and Mr. Montague had conferred on him and his Family. I believe, added She, his Motive for declining to see you here was, lest: he 1 Should not be able to command

After some more discourse, She left me, to attend Mrs., Williams, who expected her Company in the Parlour.
Will not these dear Friends think my Father very indifferent about his newfound Daughter? But no Matter; they might, perhaps, have thought worse, if
they
i s3
j they had Seen our Meeting. Yet,
'ought he to be So much difpleased J at me, for a Misfortune, rather than a Fault.? — But why these (Questions? Have I a Right to
r
judge of his Actions? No ^ let me do my Duty, that is Sufficient for me.
About Eight o’clock I told the ser\''ant (who constantly attended in my. Chamber) to inform her mistress, that, if She! had no Objection, I would chuse to rise, as I imagined I Should have a better night’s Rest for it.
I Could you believe J was So weak I as to wish to See Mr. Montague? I Think favourably of me, however, with the Indulgence of a Friend, though I tell you all my

Frailties — I did not use to be So silly.
The dear Lady came up to me immediately, and kindly assisted the Maid to dress me. I felt no Remainder of my indispofition, except a little faintness, which,
I hoped, would Soon go off.. She aflisled me downstairs. When the Parlour Door was opened, Mr. Montague came forward, and led me to a Chair.. How tender were his Inquiries after my Health! Oh, my Friend! What an amiable Manner has this charming Man! What, will become of my Heart! After sitting a little while, he drew his Seat elose to mine. Let me, Said he. Smiling, assume the Character

I wish to have you perfectly recovered, before I restore you to j your Parents. I believe you are I right. Said Mr. Montague -, I; yield up the Management of your fair Patient, whom you have hitherto

Obedience. Mrs. Williams took up her Work -, I ventured to look at Mr. Montague, to See how he was employed : he Seemed buried in thought, his Eyes fixed on the Ground. Just: as I was v/ithdrawing mine, he lifted his, and met them with a tender Glance: he immediately arose from his Seat, and, with a pensive Air, took two or three Turns across the Room, and then resumed his Seat with visible Emotion. What can all this mean? Why is he So thoughtful and melancholy } Why all this Care to suppress his tenderness ^ for that

j After Sitting about an Hour, Mrs. Williams, too kindly, I thought, advised me to go up to. my Room, lest I should be the worse for sitting up So long. I was ashamed to make any Objection, and rose at the first mo tion. Mr. Montague Seemed to wilh my Stay, but Said nothing,

I dismisted the Maid; and, finding, no Inclination to steep. Sat down to write.

had never Seen him So lively. I could have difpensed with this Proof of his Indifference for me, though it was, perhaps, well I meant.

Be pacified, my Dear, said my Mother, compose yourself; Things may turn out better than you think for. But what Objections have you to this Gentleman? Oh I don't name him, dear Madam, cried I, I cannot endure him. that’s strange! Said she, and, I think, a little unreasonable; for he has

Said my Mother, shaking her Head; alas 1 Love alone will not make mar riage happy. If you would enter that State v/itli a prospect; of Comfort, chuse a Man of easy Fortune and good nature. Believe me, who have tried it. good nature is: the best: Qualification in a Husband. I fear your Notions are a little romantic, a

it was not for this Same Father of mine, I would go down and lower his Pride -, but, alas 1 I must: be all stmpering Meekness before him. — Adieu — I won’t have him though — mind that.
The Visit is over, and I return to my only flappiness, that. of conversing with you. Here I am all mysels, without disguise; permit me, then, to ease my Mind, by relating the trifling Particulars of the Afternoon.
When I entered the Parlour, the Company rose to receive me; the Gentleman offered to lead me to a Chair. I pasted, wdthout Seeming to observe him, and went 1 up to Mrs. Henley. Dear Madam, Said I, I am extremely glad
to
210 thehistoryof
to See you; I hope you have had your Health, since I had that Pleasure last. — She returned my Compliment, and exprested her Joy at my Return., miss Henley Sollowed her Example, and added, we have greatly misted your agreeable Company 5 nor are we singular in this the poor Major, you See, has pined himself to a mere Shadow. If the rest of your obliging Compliment has no more Foundation than what relates to this Gentleman, Said I, I must be mortified in doubting the Truth of it; since he is, I think, one of the most Substantial
Shadows I ever Saw. That is no Proof of my not mourning your absence, Said he -, but I
am
. 11
/
am one of those Lovers that would rather live with you, than die for you -, though, if I am denied the first, the other must, inevitably, be the consequence. Oh, 111 answer for it. Said I, no Such tragical Effects will follow y or I would do all in my Power to make you so Shining an Example to the degenerate Race of modern Lovers. Would you so ill reward my tendernesssaid he. Ill, do you call it? an swered I y what! to make your Name immortal? and give you, perhaps, the only Chance you have for Fame? What do you; think, Miss Henley, would ^ not his Fate be enviable } doubtless,
answered She y but, I hope, ' you
will
21
will not be So kind to all your Lovers, as to Suffer them to die' Tor you. cohsider, Men are ' Scarce it is bad enough of you to monopolise fb many of them as you do; but while there is Life there are Hopes, that they may come amongst us again. Spare
Lord Cleaveland, at least, if loe should become your Slave, which he Seems in a fair Way for; he is always talking of you, and, every Time I see him, regrets your absence.
I blushed, and was in great Agitation, at the Mention of this vile Man. My dear Mother was in Pain for me, and changed the discourse, to take off their Attention from me. The Major,
however.
Miss.lucinda Courtney. 213
however, observed my Confusion. Ah! Madam, whispered he, how happy should I be, if I was Lord Cleaveland! I dare Say you think fb, answered I, a little disdainfully •, a Title is a pretty distinction. Only as it seems to be distinguished by your Love, replied i he. I gave him a Look So full of Contempt, that he Seemed disconcerted.
The Conversation for the rest of the Evening became more general. — I remember nothing of Particulars : — But, upon the whole, the Major was officious, and Miss Henley obliging; Seeming to have forgot that I had deprived her of an Admirer. I wish
4
I could
I
1
21
I could repay her kindness by making him return to his Duty. Before' they left us, the Gentleman took an Opportunity of Speak
I
ing to my Father in private. — I suppose I was the Subject.
What shall I do, my dear Friend I find my Dislike of this Man, as a Husband, increases every Time I see him y and yet, to do him Justice, he is rather handsome than otherwise, and no Fool. — But he does not please me. — I am Sure I cannot be happy with him.
My Father went out almost as Soon as they were gone, and in a pretty good-humour. I Suppose he is pleased at the Thoughts of getting me off his Hands.
Yet
 15
'Yet let me not put a wrong Con ifruction on his Behaviour -- -- -- --
I
Perhaps he only rejoices at the, prospect of my being So well provided for.
My Mother, again, with great Sweetness and good Sense, endeavoured to reconcile me to what. She Saw, must inevitably happen. You know. Said she, the determined Temper of Mr. Courtney, yield, gracefully, then, my Dear; Child, to what your Duty obliges you to. Dear Madam, answered. I, does my Duty extend So far? Must I have no Regard to my own happiness, and only study that of others 1 This j is hard, indeed! I am yet but
I
■ perhaps, I may. Some
Time
2i
Time or other, be able to marry one who may please my Father, and not be disagreeable to myself. Perhaps you might, replied my Mother, but, I fear, he will not, put it to the Trial. Your late unhappy Affair with Lord Cleaveland makes him impatient to See you out of his Power, as he judges him to be a Man of Stratagem and Intrigue, who may, perhaps, even now, be plotting your Ruin. People, of his Turn, are not easily discouraged; the Difficulty generally inhances the pleasure. His Pride will be piqued at his Disappointment, and, I dare Say, he will Spare no Pains to Satisfy that, and what he calls his Love., Oh, dear Madam,
 17
dam. Said I, what a Regiment of May bes and supposes is here mustered up to make me embrace a real Evil, by way of avoiding an imaginary one I But we wdll drop the Subject, if you please. Time will determine my Fate. — I will do all in my Power, within the Bounds of Duty, to avoid it ^ and if I cannot — Tears prevented my adding any more — I courtfied, and I left the Room.
After taking two or three Turns across my Chamber, I Sat down to write to my Coitjiantia, — But I begin to be drowsy. I will encourage the kind Mefienger of Sleep,

My dear Mrs. Williams has been here this Morning. My Heart fluttered excessively, wdien I saw the well-known Chariot; but it Sunk into the lowest: Dejection, when I found She was alone.
don’t, you think it would have been more polite in Mr. Montague, if he had condescended to pay one Short Visit to her wdiom he had conferred such Obligations •on, and who was So very grateful

for them — But, perhaps, that would have been doing too much. Yet, if he had but just asked me
how

how I did, after my illness — but

then, indeed, he knew Mrs. Will Earns could inform him, when She returned — and, I suppose, if the Truth was known, he cares very little about the Matter. Yet, what high Profellions he made me!
■ — Oh, these Men 1 We poor Females may truly Say, with the Frog in the Fable, Whafs Sport to you, is Death to us. But it will Soon be out of his Powder to give me any more false Hopes.

Though I ought to do it, as a Penance, for my being So foolishly presumptuous as to believe, without better Reasons, that I was dear to one who, it is visible, by his Conduct, cares not for me. — I am ashamed of my weakness. — Oh, my Dear, am I not very unhappy? I, have hardly ceased weeping. Since I returned Home.
He Sent his respects and best Wishes though, it Seems, by his

to make him alter a resolution that made me So unhappy.

I Sat down to work this Morning in the Parlour; my Father came in Soon after. I was every Minute afraid he would begin to talk upon the dreaded Subject of my Marriage but I was relieved, when I Saw him take up a Book. After haying read Some Time in it, he looked at his Watch. The Major stays long, I think. Said he. I trembled at his Name, and

got up to leave the Room. Where are you going? cried he. You Say you expect the Major, Sir, Said I, and I suppose my presence is not necessary. How People may be mistaken! Said he -, but sit down again, for the Visit is to you, and I am the person whole presence is unnecessary. I hear him coming — Remember he is to be your Hustand, So treat him accordingly. I leave you to receive him, and take Notice I expect to be obeyed. He left the Room, and in came the odious Man.
vshat foolish Figures we both made! Can anything be more ridiculous, my dear Confiantia, than two persons cooped up together to begin a formal court fhipi declare, notwithstanding
T. r mv
22
my disagreeable Situation, I could hardly help laughing.
After the usual Compliments, ' he took a Chair, and I my Work. He was Silent for Some Time — I followed his Example, resolving not to interrupt his Meditations. At last, after clearing his Voice, he began
I suppose Mr. Courtney has informed you. Madam, that I pre Sume to hope — He paused — I continued filent. Forgive me. Madam, resumed he; I want Words to express my tender Sentiments — my Heart is too deeply affected to Suffer me to be eloquent — the Sincerity of my Passion must plead in my Favour, since the Timidity it inspires, deprives me of the Freedom I ^ Should
I
 27
should have on any other Subject. You did well then. Sir, Said I, to address me by Proxy. — By Proxy! cried he, interrupting me j I hope I wms not to blame
in making Mr. Courtney acquainted with my Love? Perhaps not. Sir, an Swered I; but it would have Shown more of the Love you profess, if you had endeavoured to. know my Senti

ments, before you revealed it to. one who will, perhaps, deprive me of a Freedom I ought to have in an Affair that So nearly concerns me — It appeared that you did not much doubt of success. How much you wrong me! interrupted he; and how unhappy do I think myself in your displeasure! So far from presumption

22
tion, I always feared, and still do, that 'my Passion, as it could claim no Merit, would not be rewarded with So great a Blessing as the Return of your Love. But you cannot blame me for attempting to gain so rich a Prize, especially as I have Hopes your Affections are not engaged. I will Spare you the Trouble of Saying any more on this Subject, Said I; permit me to declare my Sentiments without disguise. If I could think of encouraging your Addrefies, I wuuld not have given you the Pain of making an Apology for having acquainted my Father wdth your Intentions. I believe it is the most prudent Method •, but I cannot — forgive me. Sir, I cannot but regret your hav

ing (undefignedly, I believe) Subjected me to a great deal of un easmefs, which would have been prevented, if you had first made yourself more Sure of my Consent. I am obliged to you for the Honour you do me, in making me your Choice, when you might justly pretend to' my Superiors; but I Should ill repay the Favour, if I should give you my Hand, when it is not in my Power to bestow my Heart. I can make no Objection either to your person or Fortune; but, you know. Love is involuntary — I may, perhaps, make a less justifiable Choice but — Oh! Madam, interrupted he. Sighing y Spare me a little — leave me Some Glimmer ■

230 The history or
ing of Hope — do not let me take this as your final answeft — Suffer me, by my Afiiduity, and the most tender and constant passion,
to endeavour to Soflen your Heart. Time may — Permit me to interrupt you in my Turn, Said I; you have made a Request that I ought not to grant: No Sir, do not think I wuuld keep any one in suspense in an Affair like this; I have not given my answer rashly, but have deliberately considered, and find I could not be happy, if I consented to be yours. Why, then. Should I give you, Hopes? The only re turn I can make for the Honour you do me, is to be sincere, and Save you any farther Trouble on my Account and not, as Some,
perhaps.
\
 31
perhaps, would do, give Encouragement, where there was no Design of fulfilling, merely to have the Pleafiire of retaining a Captive, whom a positive answer would release. Do you think, then. Madam, said he, that your cruel answer has released me? Alas! I am, if possible, more enslaved than ever! Your very refusal has more Charms than the consent of another. Let me then delude myself with Hope, the Comfort of the miserable. Since I cannot cease to love. Do not blame me, then. Said I, for your being disappointed. I have taken the Liberty to Speak with Sincerity; if you will still hope, you must build Something on the Incon
'stancy
. 23
stancy that is attributed to our Sex i but you shall find there is no Rule without Exception, and learn to give no Credit to general aspersions. He made no answer, but Sat with his Arms folded, and looked really very pitiable.
But what can I do? He would not have loved me, if he could have helped it — nor would I dis like him, if I could have helped k — so there we are even. I See not, my Confiantia, that wear So much obliged to a Man for his Love, since it is acknowledged to, Fe an involuntary Passion.
He, got up, and walked about
the Room, profoundly Sighing.
I arose. For heaven’s Sake, don’t
/ ^
leave
 33
leave me yet. Said he. Why should I slay ^ returned I you know my Mind - — we have Said enough on one Subject, and are like to be very dull Company now that is discufsed. How happy are you. Madam, Said he, in your insensibility! I own it. Sir, Said I; I wdfh you to be So too, and endeavour to restore you to it. Oh, how vain is the Endeavour! Said he -, no Time can effect it. But what shall I Say to Mr. Courtney? Direct me. Madam, that I may not be the unhappy cause of your Suffering more uneafiness. You are very generous. Sir, answered I, but 1 fear it is not to be avoided, without telling a Falsehood and I would not
buy
/ '
23
buy my Peace at So dear a Rate. He was going to answer, when my Father entered the Room. His Countenance wore all the Marks of displeasure.
I have overheard your discourse, Said he, and am justly displeased with your Part of it, turning to me -, but if you. Major, can still think of honouring her with your Esteem, 111 undertake to bring her to a proper sense of it: You have my consent, and I know my Prerogative too well, to yield to the unreasonable caprice of a Girl who would frustrate her own happiness. The Major ‘ was going to Speak, and, by his Look, I judged it was in my Favour; but my Father stopped
him.

him. excuse me. Sir, I guess what you are going to Say; but donst attempt to extenuate her Fault J nothing but Obedience can atone for it. If you can still, as I Said, think her worthy— — exclaimed the Major; I shall think myself the happiest of Men, if She will, without Compulsion, consent to be mine; but though I Should be miserable without her, I cannot think of owing her Hand to your Authority. Suffer me, then, by the unremitted Endeavours of a most lively and constant Passion, to try to gain her Heart as well as; Hand. i must entreat you not to give her any uneafiness on 'my Account; or, instead of her Esteem,

Shall excite her Hatred. You act generously, said my Father; | She must be insenlible, indeed, if she makes no Retmn. Go, Said he, wdth an angry Look, turning to me, who stood like a Statue; go, and recollect yourself, and try, in future, to act a little more * consistently with your Duty.
I was glad to retire, wtich I did, without answering; making a low courtesy to the Major, who bowed. Sighed, and looked Sad.

No, no -, I understand Genero sity better than that comes to.
I think I See you frowm at my Levity, at a Time when I have Such Cause to be grave, when Matrimony is staring me full in the Face, ready to Seize me, and I have no Way to escape, but by leaping over my Duty, But, believe me, it is only a Flourish; my Mirth is only in my Pen, and very far from my Fleart. But I think I have gained a short Respite, and Time may do Wonders : If the Major has any Spirit, he will never think of having me, after Such a refusal.
I have just had a grave Lecture from rny Mother, wdth a great deal of good Advice, wdiich I desire

Sire to follow in everything, but what concerns the good Man, whom I am Sorry lam obliged to make So much the Subject of my
Letters.' -- -1 am Summoned to

'Once more I return to my Friend, low Spirited and in Tears. My Father has treated me with great Severity. What Shall I do? He declares he will no longer look upon me as his Daughter, if I refuse the advantageous Offer that is made me; nor will he be burdened with one who has it in her Power, to deliver him from an Expense that his perplexed Circumstances can but ill bear. This last is a weighty Argument.

Shall I distress one to whom I am •under such Obligations? One whose happiness .1 am bound, by Duty and Nature, to study more than my own Oh! that !*■ could obey him in any other Way than that which must make me miserable! In vain •! call my reason and Prudence to my Assistance: my Heart rebels against their Dictates. I endeavour to Set the good Qualities of the Major in the fairest Light y but, forgive my weakness, while I own, with a Blush, that when I would think

Folly I would not expose to the Eyes of any but a Friend like you. Yet do not imagine it is from any latent Hopes I have
flattered myself with, about this

too amiable Man, that I refuse

not any y and, I declare, I could not like the Major, if there was no other Man in the World. I have a most unconquerable Antipathy (I think I may call it) for him. Flow do I know what his private Character may be Perhaps he is

Wednesday.
I am just returned from Mrs. Williams s, where I have pasted the Day — and Such a Day! — ^ Oh! my Friend! it was worth an Age!
My Mother was engaged at home. So could not go with me to Dinner, but, joined us in the Afternoon. When the Chair Set me down at the Door, my.

Heart fluttered excessively— — may guess the cause. A Servant strewed me into the Parlour, and went to acquaint his Lady I was there.

there.. You know how naturally one turns to the glass, on these Occasions— — was adjusting my Hair — when the Door opened, and Mr. Montague came hastily into the Room, I believe, for his Hat', for he was dressed, and, I fuppose, going out. He started when he saw me, and a Glow overspread his fine Face. For myself, I cannot express the pleasing Emotion I felt. I blushed, and lost the Power of Utterance. He approached me wdth Dignity, and, in a Voice of most engaging Softness, expressed his pleasure at the unexpected Happiness of Seeing me.. Does Mrs. ivilliams know you are here I Said he, approaching;

the Bell -- -- Yet, no, added he.
Smiling; I will not ring -- -- let
$
me be So selfish, as to monopolise your Company, as long as I can. Then taking his Seat by me, he looked tenderly on my Face. I
was a little disconcerted -- r he
withdrew his Eyes immediately, and Seemed at Some loss what to Say. I believe where the Heart is affected the Tongue is not very fluent.
'' : The Entrance of Mrs. Williams
relieved me. I rose to
V
meet her, but with such Precipitation that my Foot catched in the Carpet, and I should have fallen, but that Mr. Montague prevented me, by extending his Arms to receive me. I felt his

Face touch mine, and my con fulion was increased. Mrs. jvil liams laughed. Now?, laid She,

It is absolutely necestary they should endeavour to polish themselves, and wear off the Rust they have contracted in the Service of Mars. He pays a great Compliment to the French, said I y since he Seems to think they cannot wear off this Rust at Home, without travelling there to learn their Manners. It would

Well, really, said Miss Henley, I cannot see that: for I think him, without Exception, one of the most complete, fine Gentlemen I ever met with. I will not dispute your Judgement, Said I. She bowed; then looking at her Watch, I Sorget mysels, cried she, I have fifty Visits to pay this Morning, and here I Sit, chatting away my Time,

After a Journey, which would have been agreeable, but for the Company of a certain person, who accompanied us, we arrived, without Accident, at the Habitation of miss Henley, which is really delightful. The Situation is perfectly rural; ’tis about half a Mile from a pretty large Village. The Major pasted the Day with us, and at Night took up his Lodging at an Inn. He breakfasted wdth us the next Morning, ■ then took his Leave, and Set out for London. You may guess what his Behaviour
C 3 was
\

\
was to me y I did not, however, give him any Encouragement.
Miss henley has, in a very delicate and fiiendly Manner, endeavoured to persuade me to receive his Addresses. She Says, fly will not make my Stay disagreeable, by talking on a Subject that I do not like y but I promised Mr. Courtney, Said she, and, indeed, I wish I had Influence enough to prevail on you to accept of a Man with whom,. I am convinced, you would be happy. She then expatiated on his good Qualities, his agreeable person, and, above all, the Probability of his having his brother’s Title and Estate. How happy should I
think myself, continued stie, if
I was
t
 1
I was in your Place! For, to be free wntb. you, he was once something more than indifferent to me. But, to do him justice,
he never made any Dedaratioh of Love y So I can only blame myself, if I formed Hopes from, a little unmeaning Gallantry.
You are a generous Rival, Said I; I wish I could make the Return. that would Satisfy us both. But you will oblige me, if you will let this Subject rest, till Such Time as we can find nothing more agreeable to talk upon. Be it so, laid fly; I should be sorry to do anything that would make you repent your having favoured me with your, Company..

I should be obliged to be Silent.
We had a pleasant Walk, and found a very Spruce Congregation, especially the young Ladies, who

were very gay, though not ex ‘ actly in the Mode. On our Entrance, every Eye was fixed upon us.. miss Henley is remarkably elegant in her dress, and,. I believe, created no Small Amazement, amongst the female Part of the Audience.. I was glad when we got to a Seat, as I do not like to have

Peoples Thoughts diverted from the solemn Occasion of their meeting. We were just seated, when

the Clergyman entered. I am mistaken if the Hearts of the Fair Ones were not again stuttered, though from a different Cause. Then, Hats, Caps and Ribbons gave the Alarm; but now. Youth and Beauty was the Subject. Upon my Word, I never saw a prettier Figure. But such an Air! so jemmy! so studied! —
I began to fear he had mistaken Ids Talent, and contradicted N a ture, who seemed to have designed him for the Sword, rather than the Gown. A good Smart Fellow this, wjiispered miss Henley, Peace, Said I; I will

Effect on the Audience, by the affected Manner in which they were read. You may imagine, by what I have said of this Youth, ' that his Sermon was not very edifying : it was not, indeed. It seemed more calculated to show his Eloquence, than to improve his Hearers. We stayed till most: of the People were gone out, before we made our Exit; but we «

Among the rest, the Clergyman, too, was fpeakingto Some Nymphs, who Seemed sensible of the fa vour. As we pasted, he looked steadfastly at ns, and, made us a. most reverend Bow.
miss Henky wanted to eontrive Some Method to get acquainted with him: but I told her, I had not the least desire to, know any more of him.. He is, indeed,
t
very handsome, Said I; which, I acknowledge, would / have given a Grace to his Sermon, if it had been good for anything; but I am Sar from thinking Beauty a Sufficient Recommendation, without Merit; which latter, if I may judge from his Behaviour, he does not seem to abound in

Well said, Miss grave airs, cried Miss Henley y you are very right, to be sure; but as I am nut quite so good, you must allow me to take People as I find them — we must not look for Perfection. Some excel in one Thing, some in another. You allow him to be a pretty Fellow; but you. don’t admire Beauty, forsooth! continued She, with an arch Look: Now I do. And so do I too, when accompanied. Said I. But you don’t think it makes a good Boh, Said She. No indeed, answered I y especially in a Man. But, for Woman, you think it may do, returned she. The Gentlemen must judge of that, answered \ y I should not

choose a, Friend for that alone. But a Woman without it, tho’ she may be estimable, will seldom find herself the Object of Love. Then you will allow poor beauty to be good for something, however, said miss Henky y and, let me tell you, you have attributed a Power to it that would make most Females preser it to all the other comfortable Perfections put together. You have a worse Opinion of our Sex than I have. Said I; for, I dare Say, there are many Women that would not exchange their good sense, good-humour, and Prudence, for all the Admiration that Beauty could procure them. Well, Peace, be to them. Said

Poh, said' ' I hate grave Subjects. Have we not been hearing a Sermon? Is hot that enough? Would you make Religion a gloomy, stupid Thing? Must it constst of Canting and Wry Faces? Is edifying Conversation canting.? said I; or does it distort the Face more than any other Subject?

I suppose, for my putting yon in a way to kill the tedious Hours that mufl hang heavy on your Hands; since you do not Seem to have any relish for the proper Employment of them, and the' Stupidity of our Religion does not allow of anything that you

I left Miss Henley, aster Dinner, reading y and, with Herveys Meditations, I walked out, delighted wdth the beautiful Prospects that

Surrounded me. My Mind Serene, every Care forgot, and
1
wrapped in most: agreeable Contemplation. Sometimes I Seated myself at the Foot of a Tree, and listened to the momentous Truths, that are conveyed with, the Eloquence of Angels, in the charming Book I had brought for my Companion. Sometimes, I walked through Fields and I Groves, such as are there described with the most striking: Beauty. The pleasure I felt, in my Excurston, led me, insensibly, a great Distance from the House, without my observing it, till, looking at my Watch, I was f amazed to find how long I had I been out, and was thinking of
returning.
4
returning, when, casting my Eyes across a Field, I saw a Small house, sttuated in So delightful and romantic a Manner that my Curiosity prompted me to take a nearer View of it. I could not help thinking I saw the fv/eet Habitation Mrs. Row describes So elegantly in one of her Letters. while I stood gazing at it, with great Pleasure, my Attention was suddenly called off the House, by the Appearance of a Gentleman and Lady, who came out of it. I ran behind some Trees, where I could see without being seen. But oh! my Friend, what was my Emotion, when I discovered the Gentleman to be no other than Mr. Montague! A.

Oh, my Friend, I can describe no more of this Blocking Scene — My Strength began to fail me — but just when I thought my Ruin inevitable. Heaven interposed in my Favour. I continued to struggle and call for Assistance, with all the little Strength I had

You yield too much to the Caprice of this Girl, said he but, take your own way — she will Soon be yours. So guide her as you please. May she study to be a more obliging wise, than stie has been a Daughter.
Forgive me. Sir, Said I; ’tis but in this one Affair that I have ever ventured to oppose your Will. And this, replied he, is the only Thing in which I ever put your Obedience to the Tess. But no more of it; your mar j riage, at the Requejl of the Major,,

Forgive my Petulance, said my Father y but the Perverseness of this Creature will not faster me to keep the Command of my

Leave to go to Mrs. Williams \ must try what I can do with my Mother. I fear they will object to my going from Home — perhaps they will think I have found some Scheme to elope from their Cruelty — but they need not, I know my Duty better. — But here comes my Mother.

Monday.
I am safely arrived at the sweet Habitation of my dear Mrs. Williams. My Father parted with me in Displeasure, but my dear
Mother embraced me very kindly. The Major, too, took his Leave, after conjuring me to hasten my

Mrs. Williams, who knows my Situation, omits nothing in her Power to amuse me. I am fond of Reading, and Walking, but she endeavours to divert my Melancholy, by her sensible and engaging Conversation, and a Variety of Company, * for there is a genteel Neighbourhood, who [ visit her, without Ceremony. Amongst the rest, and the most agreeable of them, is a merchant’s Family, of the Name of
Frankiiti.

Franklin. Mr. Franklin is extremely rich, is retired from bufi nefs, and spends his Fortune freely, and with Elegance. He is of a most cheerful Disposition, as well as his Lady; has only one Son and a Daughter. The young Gentleman, indeed, is not very bright, but good-natured: a little noisy now and then His Sister is a very pretty, little Woman, full of Life and Spirits. She has taken a great Liking to me, as she says, and I am no less pleased with her Company.
She came running in this Morning, her Guitar in her Hand. I was muftng, in a melancholy Mood, when she entered
the

the Room. Hey day. Said She, what’s the Matter with you, my Dear.? Why you look like the Picture of heigh ho. — Let me die if I don’t believe you are in Love! — Come, tell me directly — You know we are to be violent Friends, and Female Friendship cannot sublisl without Secrets y So out with them. But, come, added She, I will Set you the Example. So Saying, She took a Chair, and putting on an affected Gravity, She began. You must know, I too have been in Love — 111 tell you how it was. I went ' to an Assembly, and danced with a most amazing pretty feuow, and he — Squeezed my Hand,
. played vsdth my Fan, and,
talked

talked — Oh, my Dear, it would have done your Heart Good to have heard him 1 But the vile, Fiddles made such a Noise, I did not know a Word he said— — it was very fine, very soft, and all that. In short, I talked of him, thought of him, and Sometimes dreamed of him. Now this, you know, was the very Qiiinteffence of Love, and not to be born. Now what do you think, I did? Really, said I, smiling, I cannot guess— — tell you then, said she. Finding I could not get the better of it — - I
M
went to another Assembly, and, ilap dafh, fell in Love with four
more. Unconscionable! said I,

then! replied she y why I fet them all together by the Ears — in my Heart, I mean — and there was the prettiest Civil War you ever heaixl of. Black eyes against white Teeth, fine Speeches against Sword Knots, and laced Clothes against dirty Acres; and so they sought it out, and in a little Time they destroyed one another, not leaving one alive to cry Victory, and then I was myself again. And all this was begun, carried on, and ended in lest than a Fortnight.
A most notable Scheme, said I, diverted with her Sprightlinest. Was it not? Said She; and let me
tell you, it is the only Way of
«
dealing with the dear Wretches — ■
for

i
Miss Lucinda Courtney, gi
i
so speak quickly, if you are infected with this same deadly Disease, and 111 undertake to cure you. i’ll pick out a Champion for this harmless Battle, and my Brother Shall be the Man: He dotes
<
upon you already. — Now, you may fet his Wit against your present laver’s Cockade, if he is an Officer j or if not, against any • other Trifle of equal Value. A pretty favourable Compliment, this, for your Brother, said I; 111 tell him, next Time I see him, that you may receive his Thanks. Do so, my Dear, said fly; for I, am not often favoured with them; but we will polish him between us. Well, returned I, but do you know'’ that your Prescription
will
9
will be lost upon me, and that you I have mistaken my Distemper?? Have I? said ftie y but no Mati ter, it will not be lost; for Love I is like the smallpox y we all feel I it sometime or other, more or I less y so treasure it up in your Memory, and apply it when affected. But what is the Matter with you, then? — Only a Fit of the fine Lady, troubled with the Vapours, I suppose: if so, speak, here is Harmony to revive you..
So saying, she played a sprightly Air on the Guitar.
Mrs. vvilliams came in Soon after. Wdiere have you been Said miss Franklin, as Soon as she saw her. — A fine Piece of Work I have had with this Sweet girl
I Sound
4

I found her, like a Turtle, left alone — to droop and mourn the Absence of her Mate. When I came in, she was over Head and Ears in the Hips, on the Brink of being converted into a Teapot;; here have I, like another David, been playing on the Harp, to drive away the evil Spirit — Have I succeeded, my Dear? turning to me. Moll admirably, said I : you have a most effectual Charm to dilpel Melancholy. It is my principal Study, answered she: : hate that Fiend, and never suffer him to keep Possession of me, nor of any Person elfe, if I can help it. Your Fate must have been uncommonly fortunate, said I, if
you
/*
9
you have been always able to keep yourself free from it. Fortunate! cried fly y why, yes ■ — upon the whole it has been well enough; but our happiness, you know, depends greatly upon the Imagination. — - But come, I die to hear you play, and had almost forgot I came for that very de fign. My Brother swears he Would as Soon listen to a jew’s harp, as to hear me touch the Guitar y since he was, as he Says, ravished with the harmonious Sounds you made it yield. He ran on for an Hour about it, till I was almost convinced that you
could not play at all : for, between you and I, he has no more Ear than a Block. But come,
let
p k
I ' “
 5
let us hear, my Dear If he had not praised you so much, I should have had no Doubt of your excelling in this, as well as every
% VI.
Thing elfe. I bowed, and played a Scotilh Tune, the Words of which, I remember, you was very fond of, and often made me Sing in those happy Days of undisturbed repose we Sweetly palled together.
Mist Franklin exprelsed her Approbation in high Terms. Keep not the Company of a Woman that is a Singer, Says Somebody, I forgot who; but he was a shrev^^d Fellow, i’ll warrant him. I am determined to mark down the Place for the use of my Brother; for if he hears, he dies. But
how
9
«
how amazingly Swift Time flies away in agreeable Company! See here, my Dear y I protest: it is past One; and our Family, like true Cits, fliudy their Appetite more than the Fashion, and dine at two o’clock — Adieu — I shall hardly have Time to decorate myself before Dinner; but, remember you are to teach me that
sweet Song -- How is it? --
‘‘ Hear me, ye Nymphs” No Ceremony — So saying, she tripped away, leaving her Guitar, and ' one of her Gloves, behind her. What a happy Creature is this! said I to Mrs. Williams y what would I give for some of her Spirits, to carry me through my
Difficulties I She is too volatile
to
 7
to have much Sensibility— — I had less! You ought not to wish so, my Dear, said she; it would deprive you of a great deal of Pleasure. So would it of a great deal of Pain too, answered I.
We had just dined, when a Note was delivered to me from Miss Franklin. — I trail scribe it for you, to show you her Manner of Writing.
To Miss Courtney.

Now, don’t let your Ima j gination run away with you, and present you with some pretty Fellow, whom you are to come to see, and conquer. No, no — quite a different Kind of Being is this I mean to present to you. "Lis a middle-aged Damsel, plump ’

Clara Franklin,
Do yon know this remarkable ' Lady? said I to. Mrs. Williann, Yes, said she, I have seen her, and think her, indeed, too re markable. Nothing gives me more Pain, than to see Religion cioathed in the Garb of Folly,
I was always against nick naming any Sect, however, in some Things, they might appear ridiculous. Religion, in every Form, demands our Respect. I doubt

' 03
not but, amongst the People the World calls Methodists, there are many eminent Christians : I myself have known some distin. guillied by their unaffected Piety y and the sensible Sort of their own Party allow, that there are many too apt to run into a foolish Singularity, mixing their own fan dful Notions with the most awful and important Truths, which
their Preachers, with exemplary
%
Care and Afiiduity, enforce. But this good Lady is quite, an en thufiasc — She talks of nothing but inward Feelings — and immediate Revelations from Heaven. She was once fond of Gaiety, particularly in Dress; 'but is now as

This teasing Man — young Mr. Franklin I mean — fatigues me. with his Officiousness: : full of; Compliment, and, what he thinks, \ fine Speeches, that I am perfectly sick.

It will be necessary, said fly, to say Something of his Family, in order to make you the better ac | with his Story, vv^hich, however, has nothing extraordinary in it, so don’t raise your Expectations too high.
My Brother, Mr. Montagues Father, the youngest Son of Sir William Montague, belonged to the Navy, where, having distinguished

J,
 15 euislied himself in the Service of
D
his Country, he obtained the Command of a Man of War, and made a genteel Fortune,
t
which was afterwards augmented, ^ by his fettling in the Indies, at. the Conclusion of the Peace:
- There he married a Lady of great
Merit, by whom he had a Son and Daughter: The Son, at
Twelve Years of Age, he sent over to England for his Education, and did me the Favour to cornmit him to my Care; a Trufi which I undertook with great Pleasure, not doubting but the young Gentleman would more than answer the fondefl wisnes of his Parents : For, young as he was, the Gracefuinefs of his

As I had no Children of my I own, I felt for hiih all the Affec * tion of a Parent y nor was he M less beloved by Mr. Williams. 1 ■ After some Stay with us, he was I sent to the Uiiiverfity, where he I made an uncommon progress in I his Studies, and was universally admired, for the brightness of his

him, wrote frequently for him to 1 return, but his fondness for his I Studies made him frame Excuses I ' ' and j

and Delays, though in the most Submiffive and dutiful Manner,
(However, Mr. Montague, finding himself in a declining State of Health, informed his Son of it, and commanded his Presence.
You may believe the young Gentleman was not backward to obey the Summons, when he heard of his father’s Illness. He was filled with the most painful Apprehensions, lest he should never more see his indulgent Parent, and now condemned himself, for having (though from a laudable Motive) so long denied himself that Happiness. Everything was fbon got ready for his Voyage, and he took Leave of me in the most tender Manner.

Oh that I could have Seen you married to a Woman worthy of you! I should then have had nothing left to do but to lie down in Peace; nothing else to wish for. This is an important Affair, my Son — nothing in this Life is of equal Consequence— — right or wrong Choice will either make you blessed or mise Table — there’s hardly any Medium

I am a Stranger to you, Mr. Montague, said he, but you are not foto me. Your Worth and Goodness are universally known. You have even conferred Favours on me, tho’ unknown to yourself— — Name is Bellamy. I then recollected I had once pro: : Justice to be done to a Person of that Name, against an

As this gentleman’s House was nearer than my own, he kindly proposed my going there, ’
and jstaying with him till. my Recovery, promising to acquaint my Family with what had happened. I made no Objection y he helped me into my Chaise, and, getting into it with me, left his Servants to take Care of my Man, who had received some Wounds in the Assault, as well as myself.

I From that Time the moll: cordial I Intimacy subsisted between us. I I inquired diligently into his Affairs, j which I found a little perplexed: I I was so happy as to be assisting to him, in fettling them on a I better Footing, and making his j Circumstances easy.
I Mr. Bellamy was a Widower, I having lost his Lady a few Years I after their Marriage, ^ who left him only one Daughter (Oh, this Daughter! my Conjiantia !J I of whom he was doatingly fond, I and not without Reason, ftnee I fly excelled in every Accomplifti i ment of her Sex.

Mr. Bellamy, in her, absence, [ had no pleasure, but in my I Company. You may believe our Children were Srequently the I Subject of our Conversation. l
easily I
 35
easily saw my friend’s Sentiments were the same as mine, with Rer guard to our Union; but the con fcioufnefs of his inferior Fortune made him refrain from the mentioning it, lest he should seem to encroach on my Friendship, and fet too high a Value on the
Services he had rendered me, which,
%
he always protested, were more than repaid, by the Returns I had made him.
However, one Day he ventured to alk me, as a farther Proof of my Regard for him, if I would condescend to be his daughter’s Guardian, in cafe he Should die before me; which, he said, he had Reason to think would be

Affections, we will perpetuate our Friendship by an Alliance between our Children. I will not force my son’s Inclination; but if he is not prepoffelled in Favour of another, his Duty to me,, and the Charms of Miss Bellamy, must make him yield, with Pleasure, to so happy an Union. I Hope We Shall both live to See them blefied: in each other.

are above such low considerations— — will your Son — • But is he not yours? — And does he not, as I have heard, refeinble his I Father in every noble Virtue? — It is enough, more than enough — You overcome me with your Goodness. Think not so highly of what I wish as much as you,

About a Year after I had made this Promise' ' had the Misfortune to lose this valuable Fpiend. His Death was so hidden, that he had not Time to see his Daughter 5 but, before he expired, he dictated a Letter to her, which I wrote for him, wherein he informed her of my kind Intention towards her. I enclosed this in one from myself, confirming what her Father had wrote; but, at the same Time, left her the

Oh, my Son, Said he, this is like yourself! You have highly obliged me! I stiall now die in Peace, Since I can meet my Friend ' without Shame, having So fully) executed the promise I made him.

Mrs. Montague and her daughter came in, and the Subject was dropped y though that Lady was acquainted with the whole Affair, and knew what their con verfation had been.
My Nephew, soon after, withdrew to his Apartment, where, flinging himself in a Chair, he began to meditate on the Engagement he had entered into. As he found there was no Remedy, he endeavoured to reconcile himself to it. He recollected all his Father had said, in Praise of the Lady, and took no small Pains to prepossess his Heart in her Favour. He determined
to
/
 47
to talk to his Sister,, and know her opinion of her. He did foi
and found stie adniired her more, if possible, than her Father did, Mrs. Montague, too, spoke very favourably of her; though, he thought, not quite so feelingly
as the others. To say Truth, this good Lady wished not, if it could have been avoided, to have laid any Constraint on his Choice, wisely foreseeing, that that alone, however great the Merits of the Object might be, ivas enough to render them sruitless y yet She could not blame Mr. Montague, obliged as he was to Mr. 'Bellamy, and, considering the Beauty of the Daughter, he might justly

think their Son could have no Objections.
In a Short Time after this Affair was fettled, to the great Grief, not only of his Family, but of all that knew him, my dear Brother died. I will not pretend to describe the lively. and unaffected Sorrow of his Son: The imrnenfe Estate he found himself Mafler of could make but small Reparation for such a Lost. As for Mrs. Mo tit ague, I who had passed so many happy I Years with him, and during j which she had never known any j Abatement in his Regard for her, she was inconsolable y and, I in Spite of the Consolation her I

Snatched from him, in so short a Time, almost as Soon as he was restored to them, aster a long absence. — But Time, and a Multiplicity of Affairs, in which he was obliged to employ himself, in Some measure, overcame his Grief.

You may believe I was very, impatient for his Return y though I had hardly any Doubt, but that a young Man, remarkable for his Sensibility, would be charmed with a Lady, of whose Beauty I had heard Such high Encomiums, notwithstanding his Apprehensions to the contrary ^ his Affections unengaged, and coming,

I respectfully took her Hand, and led her to a Seat. I rejoice. Madam, said I, at the Pleafure'of feeing one, who vas so highly esteemed by the Man whose Memory must be ever dear to me.

I thought, at the Time, a Sew Tearsr would have Set her off to ■ great Advantage. — But I condemned my too great Refinement, She had long lost her Father, and her Grief mufl, naturally,

I Should, perhaps, have been as ready to censure her for Affectation. Everything is wrong, where one has no Inclination to be pleased; and, I believe, that was too much the Cafe with me; for,

Set out for Mr. Romaine s y but not with Such Gaiety as he had done the firll: Time. About Eight in the Evening, he returned, made an Apology to
me, and went up to his Closet.
I was greatly affected. He favoured me with his Company at Supper, and seemed tolerably composed. We talked on in | Subjects, till the Ser j
vants were gone; he then turned to me — all’s over, said he; there’s no Help for it — Miss Bellamy mufl be the Woman at last. Then I hope, returned I, j you are more reconciled to her? j Not one Grain, answered he; j but what must be — must be. i True, my dear Sir, laid I — I fini

I will pass (lightly over every Particular, till I was left ‘ alone with miss Bellamy y which' was I as Soon as the Will was read.
She behaved very well upon the j Occaston, and did not appear too j much elated with her increase of Fortune; indeed, she Seemed, by a Sort of bashful tenderness in her Eyes, when she looked at me, to take
I more pleasure in the Prospect of being mine, than in any other Consideration. Why does my • heart refuse to make a suitable Return to, this Goodness? Sure ^ I 2 it

She honoured me with a Glance, that bade me interpret it as I pleased. The Return of Mr. and Mrs. Romaine put an End to our Conversation.
The good People j I suppose, knew that Matrimony was a Sad, sober Subject, and thought, by that Time, we Should be glad to, change it. They were not much mistaken, at leaf!: with regard to me. I Rayed not long after they came in; indeed,, if I had, I

I was the Situation of his Affairs, continued Mrs. Williams, when I first, by his Means, had the Pleasure of your Acquaintance. You know he has, for some Weeks, been in the Country: in the Letter I received today, he informs me, that he has taken Leave of Miss Bellamy, who was visibly Shocked, but did not
attempt

attempt to difiiiade him from his Design. He tells me, he will pafs a Week with me, before he sets off on his Travels, which he. longs to do, as he has, for some
I
Time, been more deeply sensible of his unhappy Engagement, and hopes to find some Relief by satisfying his Curiosity, in feeing what is remarkable in France and Italy. — He Says, likewise, Miss Bellamy proposes to pass mofl of her Time, during his absence,. at a Small house of Mr. ro 'maine Sy that is pleasantly Situated a few Miles from Town, and where she has been, for Some Time,, much pleased in retiring from the Noise and Hurry of the City.

What an agreeable Woman is ' this Mrs. Williams! fb cheerful! : and yet her Conversation is so edifying! She is near Fifty, but has still a mofl amiable Person. She showed me her Picture, the other Day, drawn when she was about Eighteen, and I never saw,, Thing more lovely. Tho’ ' her Features are not quite regu^, lar, yet her Face is one of those that pleases more than Beauty.

We were talking this Morning about Marriage, and I /cx 1 pressed Amazement, that so few People were happy in that statci be It may, in some measiire, be C accounted for, said she y I am apt to think it proceeds, gene i rally, from want of Conduct in the Wife. Mofl: Women think; they do enough, if they are ' faithful and obedient to their Husbands, not considering, that i it requires more Skill to keep a j Heart than to gain one. They are, besides, not studious enough of outward Embellishments and j Refinement of Behaviour: Even uniform Goodness will pall.

Man is an imperfect creature, and does not always admire what he eileems — Variety is necessary to excite his attention. A Woman of Sense and Spirit will ffudy to gratify this Humour: for which Purpose she mufl condescend to use a little Art, and even affect some Imperfections, by way of Soils to her more valuable Accomplishments. It is a harder Talk than is generally imagined, to keep the Affections from flagging, between two persons who are to pafs their Lives together. Women are too unmindful of these Points, and we see the Consequence. They Should Study the Tempers of their Lords and Mailers, and carefully observe

serve what they admire in others, and endeavour to imitate it, even though their Judgement should,, his Taste. But as ex j ample can befl iliuftrate this, • I will, if you can have Patience, relate some Particulars of my own Behaviour in that Situa

You have seen, continued fne, that my Person vbasi tolerably agreeable y and my Parents. Ipared no Expense to give me a finished Education. My Mother, who was one of the best of Women, with the mofi: tender aiti dufty, endeavoured to form my Mind to Virtue. She was fond i of that Simplicity of Manners which she had been accustomed to see practised in her youthful Days, and thought, a modest Diffidence and Silence more be coming and commendable in a ^ young Woman, than the more fiiowy and volatile Behaviour we now see so much in Vogue. She
endeavoured,
 91
endeavoured, wdth great Wisdom, to give me an Indifference for the ^ little outward Accomplishments of Person, and plied me with Argu i ments and Remonstrances against Vanity and a Love of Dress y af suring me, that no wise Man would esceem me one Grain the i more for Beauty. Such an one ■ will admire it, and, perhaps,
; flatter the poffeltors of it, added
i •>
j fly; but you will seldom find, that he sets any great Value on it, in the Choice of a Wife. Trufl me, dear Child, Virtue and Discretion are the only Charms that can make a true and
f
lasting Impression on the Heart. Seek not to be admired, but study to be worthy, and you will
then

then please those who alone are deserving of you. Do not be
\
dazzled by the Court that is paid to the light and frivolous Part of your Sex. Believe me, the Men despise them in their Hearts, and only follow them for Amusement. I know they laugh at them behind their Backs, for ' their Levity and trifling Prattle; while they revere a Woman, who, with fiient Modesty, bears her Faculties meekly.

Sometimes, like to rebel, when I found myself quite overlooked by the Men y while others, who, I may Say, without Vanity, had less Beauty, were admired and Sollowed, only because they were more forward, and took gmater Pains to display their Charms. I was a mere Cypher, when in Company with the other Sex, fi j lent and blushing, if they did but look at me y though, if I : could have muflered Courage, I think I could have talked as wisely, and, perhaps, as wittily, as the best of them.

After this kind Lecture fly embraced me. Heaven bless you, my dear Child, continued she, and guide you in all your Ways! I took a tender Leave of her,
t
and. my dear Father, and went to an elegant House Mr. Williams had provided for me.
For some Months my Happiness was without Alloy. Never Man was more fond than my

He, too, seemed perfectly satisfied with mine, and hardly ever left me. In my Dress I was perfectly neat, but rather grave than showy. Would you think that so good a Foundation for Happiness could be Shaken? And yet, my Dear, I, too soon, found it was not solid. Mr. Williams, by little and little, began to eflrange himself from

Complaisance produced but little ^ Effect, From Coolness he began to be peevish, though I observed he checked himself for it. A Sort of Lassitude possessed him, whenever he was at Home, and he seemed disgusted, because he had nothing to oppose or vex
him. 7
V
He came into the Parlour one Morning, dressed most charmingly, and never did I see a finer Figure, Are you going out.
Sir? said I. Yes, my Dear, said he, turning, carelessly, to survey himself in the Glass;; am engaged for the whole Day. This
vile Coat, observed he, does not

that understands anything of Taste or Elegance. Upon my Word, said I, I think your’s, at least, has done you Justice, since you never looked better in any I ever saw you before. Do you think said he, with an Air of self complacency; I will trust your Judgement, for once, and suppose it is tolerable. He pulled out his Handkerchief, and dropped a Letter, but which I did not see till he was gone. I looked at it, and found, by the Direction, it was a woman’s Hand. My Heart fluttered, and, for some Moments, I had a Conflict with myself, whether to open it, or not y but, at last,
y
Duty and Discretion prevailed
over

over my Curiosity, and I put it, unseen, into my pocketbook, and, by the Force of Reason, brought myself to my usual Composure.
You acted nobly, my dear Mrs. Williams,, said I, interrupting her y I fear I should not have been able to practice such self-denial, had I been in your Place. She smiled, and replied, it was, however, no more than what I ought to have done, both out of Prudence and Duty; for what Good could it have done me? or rather, how much more unhappy ftiould I have made myself, by being convinced of what I before only suspected Pray go on with your Story, Said I, and

I replied y I thought you had known me better— — upon my Honour, I have not. Forgive me, said hei ought not to have Sufpected you would— — is like yourself, to suppress your Curiosity. I did not wdsh you should See it, as it contains Some Secrets relating to a

Friend, which I do not think myself at Liberty to divulge. I do not desire to know them, then. Said I. He did not, however. Seem persectly easy, but looked at me, and watched my Countenance, as if to discover whether I was sincere. He left me Soon after, but told me, before he went out, he had engaged Sir Harry Villiers to dine with us he’s a very aceomplifhed Gentleman, Said he, and one for whom I have a particuar rer guard. You have secured his Welcome, answered I; I shall endeavour to treat him as your Friend. ’ He then left me.
About Three he returned, and introduced Sir Harry. I never

The Day passed agreeably, and he received a general Invitation, which, he Said, he Should profit by, and often do himself the pleasure to %vait upon us. After Tea, Mr. Williams and his Guest: went out together.
The next Day I received an anonymous Letter, wherein I was informed, that Mr. Williams kept a miftress, on whom he lavished all his fondness, though She was as inserior to me in person as in Virtue. The Epillle

I was rmeafy at reading this false Piece of Fiiendfhip, though I feared it was but too true. But who, thought I, can this officious Person be, that gives me this Information? I sometimes fus pected it to be Sir Harry y yet why should he expose his Friend? What Purpose can it answer Besides, the Writing ffiew^ed it to be a Female. I was weary of Conjectures, and just going to ' commit the Letter to the Flames, i when Miss Blair, a young Lady,
I for whom I had a very great Regard, and who was my most intimate Acquaintance, came in.

and tenderly begged to know the Cause. I could not resist her Importunity, but Sliewed her the Letter. She did not seem at all liirpriled. It is right, said She, that you Should be the last Person who are acquainted with Things of this Nature; yet I believe it’s no Secret to anybody elfe. But why Should you be uneasy, at what is so common? There is not one Husband in a
thousand that is so complaisant to his Wife as yours. And as to his keeping a Mistress, why, you know, it is the Faftiion. If you cannot bear one Rival, what would you do if you wms married to the Grand Seignior? Believe

Do, dear Creature, let’s lay our Heads togestier, and See is we can reclaim him. Take my Word for it, you are not in ' the right Way at prctent. I have Sometimes thought of Speaking to you on this Subject, but feared to offend. Now the Occasion is too favourable to be neglected.

who struck his Fancy, and whom he was treating with a great many fine Speeches. She was lively, and, when he was professing his Admiration of her, asked him, how he could be so profuse of his Compliments to another, when he had so charming a Wife, who deserved all his Love? True, answered he, fhe’s very handsome, so are these Pictures. IF she had your Spirits, indeed, I should like nobody better. She

You are mistaken, returned She; — at least it’s worth the Trial— —
I cannot. Said I, affect high Spirits when they are so much depressed as they now are. I will, a little longer, try what good Flumour and Prudence will do; and if they continue to sail, you shall astift me in putting your' Scheme in Execution. Well, Said She, I will not press you to what is disagreeable, but hope. Some Day or other, to See you

mean Time, I will watch his Motions, and, in Spite of yourself, inform you if your Sweetness and Submistion have attained the desired Effect. Mr. Williams coming in put an End to our Cont

verfation, and my Friend took her Leave.
Sir Harry was very constant in his Visits, and adapted himself so much to my Humour, that I could not help thinking his Company agreeable. He dropped frequent Hints of the Folly and Ingratitude of Mr. Wiiliams, who, he thought, did not make a Suitable Return to the tenderness I honoured him with. How happy, would he Say, with a Sigh, Should I think myself, if

ways discouraged this Sort of Conversation.
In the mean Time, Mr. wtl Hams continued his usual difiipa tion, and my Pride, at'his Neglect, began to get the better of my Love. I was still as complaisant in my Behaviour to him, but less tender, disdaining to bestow any Marks of Affection on one who made So bad a Return.
Things were in this Situation, when a young Lady, a Relation and schoolfellow, wrote me

Word, she intended me a visit. I had not Seen her for some Years, as She lived mostly in the Country.

try, but we had always corresponded, and I greatly efieemed her. She was lively, and a little coquetifh; her person tall and Slender, and her Face pretty, though a little childish. I exprested my pleasure at the Thoughts of Seeing her, and
begged her to hasten her Journey. I told Mr. Williams I expected her, and described her to him; he Seemed pleased, and was daily inquiring, when stie
would be with us.

I mentioned to you before, came in, one Morning, with a Look full of great Importance. You must: hear me. Said stie y I have Something to tell you that will

Now is the Time to follow my Instructions, when the Affections of your Lord and Master are not engaged to any other Object. Take my Advice, and, once more, reinstate yourself in his Heart. But how? said I y how am I to do it "t How? repeated She j why dress, flaunt about, and, to crown all, make him jealous. Sir Harry will aftift you in this last Project. Oh, Said I, Shaking my Head, this is a des perate Remedy, and, I fear, may prove worse than the disease. Pish

I wish I had a Husband, I would teach him better Manners — i’d train him up in the Way he should go. Oh, said I, Maids and Bachelors are alwmys excellent Managers, and very Sagacious: much like I our coffeehouse Politicians,

My Couftn, Miss Kitty Forefi, impatiently expected, came at last. Mr. Williams was at Home:
I
he surveyed her with Attention, and, I could observe, he liked her Person— — was, indeed, a very agreeable Figure. They soon became iritimate — ‘her Vivacity entertained him, and file feetned more dctighted with his Company than with rhine, and was never so cheerful as when lie
f
was
'"N
 19
r
I was present. They laughed, sung, and romp’d together very prettily. You may believe it was i no great Diversion to' me, to see her engross his whole Attention, but my Pride was too great to drew any Uneafmefs. ■
One Day, in palling by her drefiing Room, the Door being half open, I saw enough to make me fear they would carry ' their Toying too far, but I ftified my Suspicion, and longed Sora favourable Opportunity to Send her Home to her Parents. She was young and imprudent, but I hoped Mr. Williains was not yet so abandoned, as to take ' Advantage of her Frailty.
1
L 2 The
22
The constant Proofs I had of his Indifference for me at last;
^ exhausted my Patience. I saw my dear mother’s Instructions were wise and good, but not effectual: I,. therefore, determined to change my Conduct.
Sir Harry had often been endeavouring to prevail on me to visit Lady L -- -- -, a distant Relation
of his, and who had earnestly sought my Acquaintance, but I knew fly was a Woman of Intrigue, though countenanced by People of Fashion. Her Ploufe was a constant Theatre of
t
Pleasure and Dissipation, and I j did not doubt but Sir Harry had his Motives for engaging me to .] visit her; for tho’ he was always i
respectful, I
 21
respectful, and professed nothing
but Friendship, I had Discern
\
enough to see he wished for something more. I now thought this Lady, as well as’ himself, would afiift me in my Project; so the next Time he mentioned her to me, I consented that he Should introduce me to her. His Eyes Sparkled with Joy, at having carried his Point, and the following Evening was fixed on for his attending me to her Rout. I Said not a Word of my Intention to Mr. Williams, but, after Dinner, ' went to my drefiing Room, and did not return to the Parlour, where I had lest him and my Cousin, hill I was drefsed, and

that in so different a .Manner from what was cuftomaiy, that they were struck wdth Amazement, when I made my Appearance. It must be owned, Dress is a great Advantage y I hardly knew myself. So great a Change had it made, for the better, in me: for I had not confined mv

Miss Foreji, who, I dare say,

rejoiced at the Thoughts of my Absence, begged I would make no Apology. Am I not at Home? said she y Why, then, should you use any Ceremony? Pray, said Mr. Williams, may one ask where you are going.? Why, I don’t know, answered I, whether you may or notr — it is not, perhaps, '

I, going to my Harpsichord y is this right? You are wondrous fond of Music, Today, said Mr. Williams. O, doatingly, I replied y they that

— you are strangely altered of a Sudden. Nothing like dear Variety, returned I; one cannot be always in the Same Humour — all Things change — we have daily Instances of that. — But what can keep Sir Harry So long? added I, looking at my Watch j I shall discard him from my Service, and. chuse another Cijijbeo, if he does not mend his manr ners.. I had hardly spoke,, he entered the Room.. A pretty Hour,, this. Said I y what in the

he. Smiling; I Shall take Pleasure to obey you. He Sung. Inimitable 1 cried I; is it not a delightful Air,, Mr. Williams? Oh, to be Sure, Madam. — -1 am pafiionately Send of Music, Said I. I did not think you had been passionately fond of anything,

Sir Harry led me to my Chair. When I was seated in it, I re,, on my Behaviour. I had assumed a new Character, but I found it Sat tolerably easy on me.
It may not, perhaps, thought I, •
•)
produce the deflred Effect y but it' will, however, mortify him, ‘ and revenge his Indifference, by showing him that I am not ■ that fond, easy Fool he takes me for.
I can but lay aside my airs/if the Jefl: Should grow too Serious.
Lady
22
Lady L -- -- expressed her Pleasure
at Seeing me, in very polite Terms. I Sound her Apartments crowded with gay young People of both Sexes, The Card Tables were Soon filled. I made one, but had a Run of ill Luck, being unaccuflomed to play. Sir Harry was my Partner, and too polite to find Fault with my want of Skill in this polite Science. I forgot to tell you, that I desired my Friend to drop in upon my Cousin and Mr. Williams,. as is by Chance, and pass the Evening with them. A little Spiteful this, to Spoir Sport; but I thought a Trio would be Sull as Safe for miss Foreji as a tete a tete.;
I was;
 29
A
I was surprised, after having
y
been sometime at Lady L — ’s, to see Mr. Williams come in, who, after paying his Compliments to some of his Acquaintance, came up to me, and alked what Luck I had f Oh, very bad, said I y I have lost every Rubber. He stood sometime behind my Chair. I was gay and lively, but took little Notice of him. Soon after I left off Play, and Seating myself on a Window, was instantly Surrounded by a Cluster of Beaus y Sir Harry
amongst the rest -- -- -- I laughed,
chatted, and gave myself a vast many Airs. Mr. Williams was fet down to Cards, but played So inattentively, that his Partner
23  ner was out of Patience with
t
him i indeed he was more observant of my Motions than of the Game. When the Company broke up, he asked me if I wms going Home? No, said 1 carelessly, I have promised tq sup with Lady L Have you?
said he, with Emotion y I am Sorry for it. Are you? replied I y that’s amazing! I cannot southeast how it should concern you. I am equally surprised to See you here. Since I think it was not quite polite to leave miss Forrfl by hersels. I did not. Said he; miss Blair is with her — but I wish, continued he, vou would make an Apology to Lady Z, — —, and go Home with me. Im
poftible,
 31
possible, cried Ij I will not break my Promise. Besides, why should you desire it? you have not always been So fond of my com pany. As you please, Madam, Said he, and left me with an Air of Chagrin.
We Soon after went to Supper. The Company were gay to fxcess. I had no great reason to approve, of their Behaviour, and endeavoured to check their too great Freedom, by resuming my native Character. Sir Harry had not yet So far overcome the
respect he had for me, as to make an ungenerous use of my present Situation, by undue Liberties. I believe the rest of the Company were not much de.
.
23
lighted with me, as my Reserve.. a Sort of Check upon them.
I took my Leave, as soon as I politely could, and Sir Harry conducted me Home, not without Hopes, I suppose, that Time, and my new Acquaintance, would produce the Effect he desired.
I found Mr. Williams juff gone to Bed. He asked me how I liked my new Associates?? immensely well, said I. Indeed! that is strange, said he; your Taste, then, mufl: be greatly altered, from what it was sometime ago. Why, I can’t say but it is, said I; but, I think, it is rather improved. Reallyfaid he; I mufl own I differ with you. Oh, that’s nothing strange, returned I y
we
 33
we are very opposite Characters; but I hope we Shall Soon have a nearer resemlilance. It would have been better, however. Said he, if I had strove to imitate your Manners, than that you Should copy mine. May be so, answered I; but as you did not Seem willing to try the Experiment, I determined I would. I am Sorry for it, replied he. I can’t help that, returned I; I have, in vain, strove to oblige you — ’tis now high Time to endeavour to amuse myself. While I loved you, I wished for nothing more to make me happy, believing I met with a suitable Return y but when you flung off
the Mask, my Affection ceased,
and
%
<
23
and left a Void which I will endeavour to fill up with pleasure and Dissipation. Is it possible! cried he; do you, then, no longer love me? How can I, answered I, since I have as much Pride as tenderness these two Passions have been long contending for the Mastery, and Pride has at last, got the Victory. Do not think that I have been blind to
I
the Indifference with which you have long treated me — I will not reproach you, because I know our Affections are not in our own Power. While I loved, your coolness gave me uneafiness y but wh^n once that trou blesome Passion ceased to torment
me, I became easy, and careless,
like

like yourself. So now we will both seek Happiness independent X of each other.
He sighed— — have been to blame,
I own. Said he y but you have determined on a very severe punifh ment for my Follies.
Not too Severe, returned I y I think it is but the natural consequence of your Behaviour. Yet I do not condemn you y I know
the Fault is in your Nature, and my Want of Charms. I upbraid you with nothing, but only tell you the Change it has produced in me — but no more of this disagreeable Subject: ^I detefl Curtain Lectures — I am half asleep— — Saying, I turned from him..

'I. Tr, ''
V H E next Morning I went
J ^ T ^ down to Breakfast in an ■ I '1 elegant dishabille. Mr.
•| j I Wiiliams was sitting in a pensive 1 C vol, III B Posture.

Posture, leaning against the Back of his Chair, my Couftn playing with my Lap Dog. After the usual Compliments, we rernained filent for sometime. At last. Give me the Dog, said I, smiling, since it foems to be all the a mufement we are likely to have. I cannot think what makes us all such pretty Company this Morning. As for me, I have Some excuse, since I was a Rake last Night, and exhausted all my Spirits; but my dear Cousin, and the gay Mr. Williams, what has put you into the Vapours? I don’t know. Said miss, Foreji, I
r
think your good spouse has infected me with his Stupidity. But come, tell ine how you was

entertained last Night; say something, for heaven’s Sake — give ’ me a Description of the Company. I did foj — but in so ludicrous a Manner, that Mr. Williams laughed in Spite of himself. Upon my Word, said Miss Kilty, you are a witty Creature, when you choose to display your Vivacity. I find one must be careful of one’s Behaviour before you. Since you are Such a critical Observer.
A Servant just then brought me a Letter. I Saw, at the first
I,
Glance, it was from miss Biair, but I affected a little Mystery, and put it into my Pocket unopened. Mr. Williams watched my Looks with Attention, and

visible Uneasiness. I soon after
4
went to my Chamber to read it. She informed me that she had followed my Instructions > spent the Evening with my Couftn. She congratulated me on the Success of my new Method of treating my Husband, declaring she never saw anybody so restless and uneasy as he was the last Night y that he hardly took any Notice of Miss Forejiy but made a slight apo logy, and went out. She likewise told me, that ftie discovered a growing Passion in my Cousin for Sir Harry y exhorted me to persevere in my afliimed Character of sprightly Indifference, and, her Life for it, I should be successful.
She.

w"
She added, there was a Ridotto in the Evening, and advised me to
p
go to it, and she would accompany me. I determined to follow her Counsel, and went immediately to propose it to my Cousin, who consented with Joy.
Who is to be of the Party? said Mr. vvilliams, 1 don’t know yet y Miss Foreji and Miss Blair are the only Persons I am sure of. If you will permit me, said he, I will make one. I have no Objection, said I, smiling, but that it will be a little in the Antediluvian Manner, to go in Company with your Wife. No Matter, said he; we will endeavour to revive an old and better Fashion than at present prevails —
B 3 Though,

\
Though, perhaps, you would rather have Sir Harry to escort you? Fm too complaisant to own it, if I had. Said I; but your going need not prevent his. Yes, by Heaven, but it Shall, cried he, with Emotion. Dear Sir, Said I, Smiling, moderate your Tran iports; he is, perhaps, engaged, and I am Sure I Shall not alk him. But I will. Said miss Foreji, if I can meet with him, for he is an irnmense Favourite of mine. Happy Man! said Mr. wiluamsy I would not wish him to know his own Consequence, since he would not, perhaps, make; the most generous Use of it. Fie, my Dear, cried I; it is not well done to speak against your Friend.
Tour

Tour Friend, you mean. Madam,
I suppose- -- -- - the same
Thing, said I, with Vivacity; for, you know, what’s mine is yours y though, I believe, you sometimes think what’s yours is your own. Company coming in, changed the Conversation
/
Dinner, I once more made the best Use of my Toilet. My Motives must plead my Excuse for this Vanity, Since I only dressed to please my Husband. I Succeeded pretty well, I believe ^ for he paid me Some Compliments. I admire you, ^ Said he; what have you done to yourself?
I never Saw you look so well. How happy might we both have ^ been had you taken as much
B 4, Pains ' '

Pains to please me, as you now do to gain the Admiration of the World! Would you, then, have loved me for such Trifles ^ said I. I thought you had a juster Taste, and that Good-humour and virtue were the best Arts I could use to secure your Heart. True, answered he, they have the most intrinsic Worth; but what is a Diamond unpolished?? observed I, it’s a Pity I did not know your Mind sooner— — too late now.
Here Mrs. Williams was inter
✓
rupted by a Servant, who brought me a Letter. I saw it was from my Father, and trembled with Apprehensions, supposing the Contents would be disagreeable.
I would
1

I would have deferred reading it hill Mrs. Williams had finished her little History, but she would not suffer me, hoping. She Said, to have Time enough, before she lost the pleasure of my Company.
'I went to my Apartment, and, with great Emotion, opened the Letter.
Oh, my Friend! my Father commands me to return to Town immediately y and informs me that the Major is now (by the
Death of his Brother) Sir George Freeman, with the Addition of a
large Estate. He congratulates
* \
me on my approaching Felicity, as he calls it, which, he Says, the impatient Sir George will defer'
B 5 on

no longer than till the Ceremony ■of his brother’s Funeral is over. Hated Impatience! — But be it so — I ought to be unhappy, since the dear Montague is so. Yes, my Father, I will obey you. Good Heaven! — but thy Will be done. — Adieu, my Dear, I go to ' acquaint Mrs. Williams that I mufl leave her tomorrow morn ing.
London.
I took an affectionate Leave of Mrs. Williams. Miss Franklin, hearing I was going, flew to See me.
Oh, my sweet Creature! Said she, am I then So Soon to lose
you?

you } And that before our Friendship is half cemented I had ten thousand Things to tell you — see how you affect me. I have hardly wept so much since I was born, as I have done within. this half Hour, that I heard you was going. Men, Monkeys, Lap dogs, Parrots, perish all!
I If you forget me — — nothing’s worth my Care., But Say, will you write to me? — My poor Brother too — let me die if you have not turned us all topsy turvy.
I Smiled. I cannot forget you, my Dear, Said I; but, if you think it possible, write often, and put it out of my Power. She embraced me. I take you at
'B 6 your

your Word, I shall pester you with Letters. The oftener, the more welcome they will be, answered I but. See my Dear, the chaise is at the Door. — Adieu.
Continue to love me, I Shall esteem it a great happiness. I, then hurried from her. Mrs. wi/ liafns again took me in her Arms — Heaven bless you. Said She, and Support you under your Trials. I Shall See you when I come to Town, and hope to find you more happy than you expect to be. I made no answer, for my Heart was full.
I found young Mr. Franklin at the Side of the Chaise. He handed me in, sighed and prefied my Hand — I bowed my Head,
and
 3
and the Chaise drove on. Alas!. with what cruel Speed did it bring
me to the end of my Journey,
/
and the Beginning of my dreaded Misery!!
Father flew to receive me.
/
He was all Joy at the Prospect of my Marriage. My Mother embraced me with her usual ten dernefs, but my Pleasure at feeing ■ them was damped with the cruel Reflection of what I was going to suffer. My Father again congratulated me on my good Fortune. you’ll be the happiest of Women, my dear Lucinda, said he ', Sir George is the worthiefl of Men. I sighed— — looked a little displeased. My Mother feared I should offend him, and
therefore
1
therefore said, I had better go to my Chamber, for she thought I looked a little fatigued. I gladly took the Hint, and retired, and immediately sat down to inform my dear Conjiantia of my Situation — - and now, everything is preparing for this hated Marriage.
The Major, or Sir George,, I care not which he is, is to be here this Evening. Pm out of Breath, I Shall never have Spirits to go through with it. Adieu. My Mind is So uneasy, that I cannot even write to my Friend. — I hardly know 'what I Say. > Once more, adieu.
Sir George has been here — nothing but the detested Marriage
was
 5
was talked of. — My head aches — Fm teased to Death — He has bespoke a handsome Equipage. — ^ The Mercer is sent to, with an Order for some very rich Silks — But all these Things that our Sex are said to be fond of, are Trifles, that cannot engage my Attention for a Moment — My Heart is incapable of tailing any Pleasure.
A Letter is just brought me, from Miss Franklin. — Dear creature!! is very obliging.
To Miss Courtney.

But how is my sweet Friend ^ Well, I hope— — Sadijimo — but free from the Vapours, like poor half witted me, ^ who have not Solidity enough to be sorrowful, except when I think of your Absence.
Tell .me what you are doing —
I want to ask you a thousand Questions. How do the Fellows go on — Your Slaves, I mean — Are they tractable f They say _ here, you are going to take the Management of one of them on yourself— — wish you Joy — Sliut your Eyes, and take the Leap— —

I when it will come.
I But, for heaven’s Sake, tell me all how and about it. You know we Spinfters love these kind of Subjects — Heigh Ho! the very Thoughts of it make me sigh.
Here has been my teasing, Brother He wanted to know who I was writing to, but I would not tell him. You love Secrets, said he, but I can guess who it is — I, too, am going to write to the charming Lucinda. He is actually doing as he Said.

Oh, I had almost forgot. — The finest Fellow in the World — I die for him — Harry Montague, I mean — you must have Seen him — Yet, no, it can’t be, or you’d have told me y for he is, with out Exception, quite the Thing y only a little too much upon the ferioujimo — not So much awake as I would have him. — And yet the Wretch can look very waggifli, when he pleases. Such a Pair of Eyes! If he had only one Eye, with that alone, he would do more Execution than Half the Men in

England could do with a Dozen. Yet I don’t know what to make of him — we can hardly ever get him amongst us — he wanders a bout and hides himself in ftiady Groves, so like a Paji'or Fido — The dear Creature — I shall absolutely grow in Love with him.
We are to have a Ball — i’m. beating my Brain to contrive some Method to get him for my Partner; and if I Should, what a Triumph will it be over our rural mifses, who rave about him as much as I do! What an envied Creature Shall I be, while I look, Disdain on little Folks below! Then my dear female Friends whl hate me so cordially, that it will be quite delightful.

The Doctor came in just then, and likewise an old Gentleman, who, I found, was a distant Re
/
and next Heir to his Ti, tie and Estate. As soon as Sir George saw him, he held out his Hand. I give you Joy, said he, on the near Prospect of the Advancement of your Fortune. You have a large Family — It gives me some Pleasure to know that my; Death will deliver a defervingi

Man from Difficulties, and make so many happy.
The Gentleman seemed much affected with this generous Speech,, and was going to answer, when the Doctor, feeling the Pulse of his Patient, declared, that if we would not wish to Shorten the little Remainder of his lise, we Should leave the Room, for his Fever was already greatly heightened by our discourse. I arose, and slipped out, without being ' observed by Sir George, to whom I was loth to give the Pain of parting.
As Soon as I got into' another Apartment, I flung mysels into a Chair, and gave free Vent to my Tears. You will, perhaps,

wonder at the Sorrow I express
for one I have often declared I could not love y but you must: remember, my Dear, that, as I ■ before said, I only diiliked him as a Husband. You condemn, ' perhaps, my obstinate Aversion • him in that Character, since I acknowdedge I esteemed him. But, Oh! Confiantia, you mufl be ignorant of Love, if you don’t; know that it is a much more exalted Passion, a tender, inexpressible Something, far different from bare Approbation, or cold Esteem. I suppose, one might make shift to pafs one’s Life with tolerable Quiet, with a Man who is only not one’s Aversion i but what an insipid State mufl that }

be, and how much is a Single Life to be preserred to ityou see, then, if I have exprelfed myself clearly, that one may like and yet be far from Love. But had Sir George been my Aversion, in every respect, I must have
Teen moved at the melancholy Condition he is now reduced to.
My Father had ordered the chaise for our Departure. He came into the Room where I was, and looking at me. You have cause to weep. Said he — ^ I hope you now See your Error, but your Repentance comes too late. Had it not beeii for your Perverseness, you had now been Lady Freeman, instead of which, if Sir George dies before I return,

go, continued he, I need not anticipate Misfortunes.
What can he mean? — I would not ask, but followed him, and we fet off for Town. Our Journey passed in filent Sadness. My Father left me to go to Sir George s Lawyer, and I drove - Home, where my dear Mother was waiting, with anxious Impatience, for my Return.
Are there any Hopes? Said She, as Soon as she Saw me. I shook my Head. — Alas! resumed She, poor Sir George! Is he, then, dead? No, Madam, Said I; at least he was not when I left him, but he is not expected to live. My Mother wept. Ah 1

Lucinda! Said She, you have lost a valuable Man! True, Madam, said I; yet I cannot regret him as a Husband, though I sincerely lament him as a Friend.
She asked for my Father. I told her where he was gone, and what Sir George designed in my Favour. Generous Man 1 Said They but no new Instance of your Worth can add to the Value I always had for you. I
wish— — yet dread the Return of Mr. Courtney — You say there are no Hopes — but still I shall
not be able to divest myself of Some, till I know the worst.

This happiness was granted Sooner than I expected i for miss H, amazed, and highly displeased at the cold Behaviour of her Lover, was Soon tired with dancing ^ and, pretending to be greatly fatigued, flung herself into a Chair.

and, perhaps, envying me for having her Favourite, Sir George, whom she had watched very narrowly the whole Evening) likewise took her Seat; when, my Partner leaving me to endeavour to make them stand up again, I joyfully seized the Opportunity of his Absence to quit the Room, imagining that my presence was no longer necessary, as this ridiculous Ball seemed to be at an End. I waited, however, at the Door, that I might be ready in case of another Summons. Everybody was sitting, but Sir George, who stood in the Middle of the Room, turning round upon his Heel, looking about every Way as is he had lost Something; when Miss'

Elliot, running up to him, tapped him on the Shoulder, as a Signal to follow. He took the Hint, and, putting his Arm round her Waist, led her to a Window, into which they Slung themselves, and began toying in a very pretty manner the jolly ’squire got up, and making a Noise as if he was calling his Hounds, What a Plague, said he, are you all sole away? you’re soon tired of the Chase. But, harkee. Friend, turning to Sir George, what Business have you with my Partner.? Yet, faith, to say the Truth — and then he whispered something, at which the other laughed heartily.
The Company now all appeared in better Humour, except

Was there ever anything so unfortunate, my Dear? I must not think of continuing in this Place, after what is passed. Indeed, if I could think of it, Miss Hill would not, perhaps. I ftiall, therefore, leave the House as soon as I possibly can -- -1 dread the

I was in Some Danger of lose

So on I went, till I met the Mistress of the House, of whom I. inquired when the Coach Set off for London, and if there was a Spare Place? She told me, there was, and that the Stage would Set off next Morning. I was heartily rejoiced at this News. I then ordered Tea, and Sound myself

Seeing a Cobbler very busily working and Singing at his Door, I went. up to him, and asked if he

unexpected Turn of Fortune.

Mrs. Cartwright congratulated me, with the most friendly ex preffions of Joy, on my Happiness;; our agreeable Friend was interrupted by the Entrance of a Servant, who came to inform her, that a young Gentleman waited for her in the Parlour. Who can it be? said she. I
V
could have dispensed with his Visit at this Time, as it will o blige me to leave you So Soon — but, remember, Mr. Courtney, you dine with me. So Saying, she left us, but returned in about a Quarter of an Flour, in a Flutter of Joy. Come down, my dear Friend, Said she, come down, and welcome my beloved Brother,

As we were entering the Room, Now, said she, I will introduce two of the most charming Persons in the World to one another. She led me to him — and, oh! my Conjiantia! he was charming, indeed! since it was no other than the lovely \lon tague himself— — may imagine wtat I felt upon this Occasion— —
The HISTORY of i

He folded me in his Arms, with a Warmth far different from the civil Salute of a Stranger. — Am I, then, once more blefsed with a Sight of the mofl lovely and befl beloved of Women? said he. Oh 1 my Sister! you know not what a " Happiness you have procured me, nor how fervently I love the dear, the charming Lucinda I But, forgive me, added he, feeing me

prevented my declaring it long j since— — I am now Sree, and I returned to England with a Re J Solution to make her an Offer of I my Hand, for fly has long had I pofteflion of my Heart.

Sion. I believe my Daughter is above the little Punctilios of her Sex — and, indeed. Ladies are seldom displeased at a Lover for acting with Indecorum, when it proceeds from the violent Effect of
t
their own Charms.
I began now to recover from the Emotion Mr. Montagues Presence had caused, and, smiling, told my Father, I must take the Liberty to interrupt him, since I found! he was going to expose the Vanity of my Sex. Mr. Montague, Said I, Seems to have Eloquence enough to Support his owm cause j ’tis Time to drop a Subject that

My Joy for his Return will be greatly heightened, if his Wishes are crowned ^ \
. by the Consent of my lovely Friend, whom I long for the Happiness of calling Sister. Mr. Montague took her Hand, and put it to his Lips. — Nobly said! cried he, and what I expected from that Goodness that has endeared you to me more than the

Bands of Nature. Then ap preaching me, with a respectful Air, but full of Tenderness; Let

me hope, too, said he, that my I Presence is not unwelcome to the charming Lucinda, and I will give a Loose to Joy, that will amply reward me for my former Sufferings. — I blushed— — cannot dissemble, Said I; I may wish to be filent, but, thus called upon,
I mufl frankly declare your pre i fence is So far from being unwelcome, that I rejoice to See you.
I cannot refuse the Esteem that is due to your Merit, and the

Mrs. Cartwright, who saw me a little difconceited, turned the Conversation, by ask | her Brother Some Questions,, his Travels.

I excused myself, as well as, I could, though, I must own, ' she merited more Confidence — but I was unfortunate, and unwilling to publifti it. Mr. Montague undertook to reconcile us, which was, indeed, easily effected. The dear Lady embraced me: at that Instant, Mr;. Montague put his Arm found us both.

Let me lead you to her, and may Some Angel lend you his Eloquence, to persuade her to make me the happiest of Men, by fixing tomorrow, or next Day at Sartheft. — Oh, Heaven! cried I, to niorrow! — How can you think of Such a Thing?

I It must be fb. Said he; I See nothing but a Prospect of continual Felicity before me — I only meant it would be more blessed than any Day I had yet faffed. — Yoult frighten me from being yours. Said I, is you flatter yourself with such extravagant Scenes of happiness,

pinefs, as you must certainly be disappointed: And it will Sit heavier on you, than it, would upon those who enter upon Matrimony with less sanguine Hopes. Why Should we expect more than Experience teaches us is the common Lot of mortalsi never yet met with a Pair — Ah! do not, my beloved Ducinda, cried he, interrupting me; do not compare my Love with the common run of theirs who pretend to that noble Passion; since mine is founded as it ought, not only on the admirable Beauty of your Person, but the never fading Graces of your Mind. Can I, then, 'change, since these must

I in my Presence, say anything j against Matrimony? I find I must j chide you. What think you of j Mr. Cartwright and meare

the Breast of Man, and the truest Friendftiip, can give you a Prospect of being so, then let my Lucinda lay aftde her Fears. He took my Hand as he spoke this, and I answered by a Look that testified how willing I was to believe him.

But, my dear Conjiantia, I shall tyre you, by dwelling upon these Trifles; for, if the Company of Lovers is disagreeable, to those who are Spectators of their little Tendrejfes, how much more insipid must the Relation of them be, since there is no conveying an Idea of the winning Grace with which my dear Harry gives a Dignity to all he says, and does?
But

But are you not impatient to know something more of Miss Bellamy? — There was nobody in the Room wdth me, the other Day, but Mr. Montague. I took * that Opportunity to inquire about her, expressing my Hopes that she was happy, or I should not be persectly So. He paid me a Comjpliment on the goodness of my Heart, as he was pleased to call it; and added, that it gave him pleasure to be able to as sure me, that I might be perfectly easy on her Account, Since her Fate had ordained her to bless a Man who was as much more deserving, as he was Sensible of her Perfections. Well, but dear

I arose, as if with Design to go. — Oh, my dear arbitrary Tyrant! said he, Seizing my Hands;

.
\
19
what, I dare say, will make me, in Reality, before I have done j since it will recall Scenes to my Remembrance that were, once, my Torment.
Mrs. wiluams has, I suppose, told you the Situation I was in, with regard to miss Bellamy, when I had first the Honour and happiness of your Acquaintance. Till then, I had hardly felt the Weight of my disagreeable Engagement, and was endeavouring to reconcile myself to it. As I
1
found I could not love miss Bellamy, I took all imaginable Care to guard my Heart from the Attractions of any other Woman. I persevered tolerably in my Indifference,
 95
ference, notwithstanding an un
\
common Attachment to your charming Sex. But my Time was not come; for as Bruyere I says. He that is injenjible, has only not seen the Berfon he is to love. So, the first Moment I beheld you, I lost my Liberty, and : Peace — It was then I began, indeed, to feel my unhappy Engagement. I ffruggled to get the better of my fruitless Passion,
and forced myself to see you as little as possible, and when I did, endeavoured to conceal my Regard, not daring to make an Offer of a Heart, when my
Hand was not at Liberty. You must have observed the torment

Passion. I thought of nothing

but you, and had nobody to interrupt my Thoughts. Seeing no Remedy, and that my Malady was incurable, I determined to fet put on my long talked of Travels. You may believe it cost me no Small Pain to persevere in this resolution. Before I fet off, I paid a reluctant Visit to Miss Bellamy. I will

I indeed, I have forgot most of j the Particulars of it, though, upon the whole, fly had greatly the Advantage of me, for my

'ready to run mad with Joy, at the

21
a Husband, Come, confess, is he not a delightful Fellow? Let me die, if I would not run
to the world’s End to find such another, if I might have him for
my Pains. let’s go down to him, that we may give him an Opportunity to say some fine Things upon the Occasion. I long to see him cast himself at 3i'our Feet, and talk unintelligibly — There is something so pretty in the soft Nonsense of
these Lovers! -- -- Come, come
along, I am already on the Wing. A little Patience, my dear Miss Franklin, said I cannot go yet — I must write to my Conjiantia first. A Fig for
your

your. Conjiantia, said She; none of your Scribbling now; you i have Something else to think of, ] Let us poor Spinfiers, who are not So happy as to have a Montague to entertain us, flourish i with our Pens, and die for Lovers : whom we never Saw, and boast of Conquests that we never, made. If this precious Friend of yours must be wrote to, make ^ me your Scribe, i’ll warrant. i’ll tell her all how and about
^ it.
j I take you at your Word, returned Ij I own I Shall be a : ifttle unfit for the Employment i for Some Time: You will oblige 1 me, theresore, if you will inform

form my Conjiantia of what happens from Time to Time, till I have Leisure to resume my Pen. i’ll do it, said fly; leave it to me — but, by the by, what am I to tell herthat Harry and you are billing like a Pair of Turtles, and that, finding no Remedy for the Excess of your Pafiions, you married, which broke the Enchantment, and restored you to perfect Indifference? I suppose, too, I must tell her how prettily you behaved on the Occasion; how prim and modest you was, and how Harry talked to you, looked at you, and all that, — Have I my Leflbn right? Dear Creature, cried I,
what

what would I give for your charming Spirits! Give me Harry, said.. stie, and you shall have them,
'every Ounce — Oh, I see, ' there go two Words to that Bargain well, well, e’en keep him — but let’s go dowm to him, however.
i I promised to follow her im i mediately, which I will now do, as I have finished my Letter to my beloved Friend.
; Once more I entreat you to let me have the Happiness of feeing I you soon. Mean Time, I dare say Miss Franklin will keep her Word, and write to you. She is

i' '
Ihe would have a Proxy, ftie had pleased to let it be in her Marriage; you might then have still been entertained by your Friend, while I Should have been i employed in a Manner more
'agreeable to my Taste. This

Soul, I am ready to die with laughing at her — and yet, see what it is to be handsome!! thing She does looks graceful. she’s a Sweet Creature, it mull be acknowledged — and So is this bewitching Harry. it’s well for you that you was So wise as to keep out of harm’s Way. — I wdsh I had never Seen the Fellow. — I Shall grow quite: in Love wdth Matrimony if I stay much longer in this house. — Pray Heaven I may not catch the Infection!
This Courtfiiip is a joyous Thing, where it is between People of Sense and Refinement. I have seen a Pair of Lovers pawing at one another, like a Couple

\
 19
of Monkeys, enough to turn one’s Stomach— — here, it is all so delicate, so tender, and so pretty, that it would do your Heart good
to see it, " '

Harkee, my Dear — you must promise to be very fond of me, when we meet; for I intend to enter into a violent Friendftiip vdth you; so don’t judge of me by my Letters, for I can tell you I am a good kind of a Girl, tho’ a little harum fcarum now and then; but you must love me for all that; for, between you and I,
I would not give a Pin for a wo man after ftie is married; She grows So wise, forsooth! and lb notable! there’s no enduring her. Then, farewell all our little Sel

220 The history op
crets, about Lovers, the very Life of female Friendship; they have something elfe to do, than to mind such Trifles— — as Lucinda will be soon good for nothing, we ought to ffrike up an Intimacy in our owm Defence; for there’s no living without a Confidant to tell one’s imaginary Secrets to. I have a whole Budget full to entrufl you with, and you, I suppose, are brim full of them. I Shall then hear of your Damons and Strephons, and — Oh, I die to See you — So pray be a little quick in your Motions, for I have nobody to talk to but the old Grecian, Mr. Courtney; for Mrs. Cartwright and Mrs. Williams are as busy as Bees about
this
s
 21
this same Wedding, and the happy Pair are so taken up with one another, that there’s no such Thing as having their Company a Minute together.
But I forget — This is not the kind of Letter I was bid to write — I had Orders to tell you all that passes here, very minutely; instead of which, I have been scribbling away, without either Form or Method — But, hang me if I know how to help it. here’s nothing
going forward, but what you may imagine better than I can describe. tomorrow is to be the Day of Days — yet, even then, what is it but a Wedding.? though, I believe, an uncommonly happy one.

Miss Clara Franklin, to Miss Constantia Bellmour.
The mighty Affair is over — My dear Lucinda is now
Mrs. Montague, and the happiest: Woman in England, in my Opinion — and her own, too, or I am mistaken.
The lovely Bride looked like an Angel, and the charming Bridegroom was, at least, the handsomeft of Mortals. They were both elegantly dressed. Lucinda in a yvhite Negligee, with small Silver Sprigs; over it, a i Small black Lace Cloak, which
f

of her Neck; round which was a black Collar with Stars of Diamonds, and her Hair, which is the finest in the World, was frenched, and adorned with the same, Mr. Montague was in White and Silver — but I cannot convey an Idea of his easy, graceful Figure. His long, light brown Hair was dressed with most becoming Negligence - — In Short, it was Paris and Helen, Venus and Adonis, Adam and Eve, or, if it pleases you better, you may suppose they looked like your sweet Self, and your favourite Swain, and then,
T am sure you’ll think them handsome,

After they were decorated in this Manner, and I had dizen’d out myself a little, we fet off, for Church. Miss Lucy was mighty grave alf the Way, and talked much of the Solemnity of the Service, and the awful Sense she had of the State she was entering upon, as Misses are, wont to do on these Occasions; and very right, to be sure ■ -
let me die, if I could help laughing at this Same Solemn Service. I wondered how' She could keep her Countenance — but the Sweet Soul curtfied, and looked as prim as a Nun. Mr., Montague behaved, with easy 'gracefulness, and had his Lesson

22
as pat as you please, and repeated it with a manly and noble Air.
When the good Man pronounced them Man and Wife,
I
Mr. Montague, according to Custom, saluted his Spouse, and, taking her Hand, ^ led her to his Coach, into which he likewise pushed me, for I can hardly say he handed me; so impatient was he to take his Seat by his dear helpmate. I kept him, however, in pretty good Order, all the Way Home.
The Day passed happily everybody was in Spirits. The Bride and Bridegroom were, indeed, a little absent, now and then, but none, but myself, took Notice of it.
After
 27
After Dinner, C would have given the World for a Dance, but there were too few of us, foi was obliged to be satisfied with a little Concert, of which we were the Performers. Mr. Montague plays divinely, and, you know, how sweetly Lucinda sings.
I protest I had almost forgot —
My Brother was one of the Party;
✓
but he, good Soul, could make but little Harmony. I would have recommended the Salt Box to him, as an easy Instrument; but he excused himself, and chose rather to kick his Heels, by way of Tabor. Poor Fellow I he had no great Relicti, either to Singing or Dancing — he had lost
his

his Mistress, you know —, but his Sorrow is not deadly — I think he’ll get the better of it.
In this Manner we made the Hours fly away, till T welve o’clock gave us Warning to Separate. Everybody is gone to Bed, but your new Friend, who, to show her Love to you, has kept her Eyes open, notwithstanding Some mofl dreadful Yawns, to inform you of what is pass. I know Lucinda would have done it ten Times better; but what I have omitted, we will tell you by Word of Mouth, when we have the Pleasure of Seeing you, which,
