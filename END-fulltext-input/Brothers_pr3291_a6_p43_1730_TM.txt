ET was in the agreeable
Month of May, when the Fruit trees began toblos^ Sbili, and Nature had drel'd herseif in her besi Attire to welcome the approaching Summer, when every grass plat yielded Variety of Perfumes from the different Flowers that Sprung from it, and the industrious Bee having Shook off the Winter Coldj and collected hew Vigour from the kind Influence of the

warmer sunbeams, was just venturing Abroad to extract the Honey from the great Choice of Flowers, that everywhere enamelfd the Surface of the verdant Plains, that Don Guzman and Don Antonio, prompted by an Inclination to Travel, fet out from m? drid in Spain, and in a Short time reached verfauks in France, where liking the Place, they proposed to spend part of the Summer, before they proceeded any farther.
They had not long resided in that noble City, before they were the discourse of all the Gentlemen and Ladies in it, and the whole Court rang with the Behaviour and Conduct of the two Strangers; they were the Admiration of all the Belles, and consequently the Envy of the Beaux; to lay the Truth, they were both very accom plifh'd Gentlemen j they could Sing, Dance, and play upon all Kinds of Music to Perfection; and as they were of a becorning Height, lb their Features were fb agreeable, and the
T urn
  pimtfei, |
Turn of their Bodies So well adapted to the belle air, that they wanted none of those persbnal Advantages, that might fet off, and give a Grace to the Qualities and Endowments of their Minds : Nor was this all, for they were perfect Matters of five Languages besides their own, viz. Greek, Latin French, Italian and Lnglifh; they were likewise well versed in hisiory, Law, Poetry, and all the Branches of the Mathematics, and very conversant with all the Writings of the Ancients as well as thole of later Authors; they wanted, in Short, nothing that might fender them complete; they had all the Greatness and Majesty of the Mart in them, which was mollify'd by a Mixture of that softnefs and Sweetness, which seems peculiar to the fair Sex, and what is still more remarkable is, they lb exactly resembled each other, that they were often mistaken one for the other; the only Mark of Distinction, was a Mole over the right Eye of Don Guzman, who was the
B a eldett^
4 The BRO T hers: Or,
eldest, and a very little taller than his Brother; their dress, Voice, Air, and even Sentiments were always correr pondent to each other, and, by a kind of Sympathy, whatever one proposed, the other of course agreed to. these Qiialifications, join’d to the Character they had Settled with everybody in the City, made their Conversation universally coveted; every one Strove to make himself happy in their Acquaintance, and all, in general, thought they could not do themseives a greater Honour, than when it lay in their Power to offer their Service to 'em, or to do. anything, that might engage them to two fucti, eminent Persons;; very Ladiesk who on all other Occasions are rather too reserved in their Behaviour towards young Gentlemen, yet, even they, strove who Should be foremost in their good Opinion, and let no Opportunity slip that might heighten their rsleem for them, and endear themselves to them; if they went to a Play, Assembly, Ball, Masquerade, or any
other
 tjhi. 5
other public Diversion, they were sure to be attended with whole Troops of the fair Sex, who endeavoured to excel each other, only to be the more observ’d by the two Brothers, who at length attained the Name of Lesfreres Beaux. Their Opinion was always approv’d of, and whatever they Said was an Oracle; if any Argument was Started in Company, their Sentiments, were looked upon as decisive, and both Parties acquiesced under them, as e lleeming them beyond Contradiction.
It happened one time, that the two Brothers, having a mind to See the fine Gardens that belong to the Palace, resblv'd to go the next Day and take a full View of them; and accordingly after Dinner they went thither, where, from admiring the Beauty that ap pear'd everywhere, in the dispofition of the Walks, and the exact Order of the Trees, Shades, Grottoes, Fountains, cascades, and whatever might make the place perfectly delightful, they fell into a deep Contemplation on the
B 3 Vegitablc
0  ,
Vegitable 'World; and being very closeiy engag’d in it, not minding which Way they went, they were in senfibly led into the middle of one of the wildernestes, where, Sfill walking without observing the Labrynth into which they had brought themseives, in turning one of the Corners that led into a Thicket of Trees, through the middle of which was a fine green Walk that went up to an Arbour, they were awaken’d out of their Study, by a Female V oice that teemed to be not far off, which sung the following Song. /

The Song was attended with a very agreeable Symphony of Several musical Instruments between each Stanza, to which   gave their Attention with a very great delight, and were, in the end, lb far fallen out of one

kind of Contemplation, into another, that they both flood looking at each other in an amaze not to be de icrib'd; and were the more confounded, because they Saw in each others Faces, such visible Marks of the Effect the Song had upon them. In this Manner they flood a considerable time before they either Spoke or mov’d, till Don Guzman broke this profound Silence in there Words, ‘ An ‘ toino^ Said he, my dear Friend and ‘ Brother Antonio, if either of tholfe ‘ sacred Names can excuse my Bold ‘ ness, in asking a (Jueflion that may ‘ ip no wise be proper or becoming ^ for me, if that consiant Trufl you ‘ have always repos’d in me, can in ^ you to aiiswer what I now ‘ ask; tell me, for my Soul thirsts to ‘ what could cause that

Don

Don Guzman express’d these Words with so much Force and Energy, and withal embracing his Brother lb tenderly, that Don Antomo finding it Was in vain to endeavour to conceal his Affair any longer, was just going to return his Brother an Answer, when they were interrupted by a Company of Ladies and Gentlemen, who having been informed they were entered the will derness, had followed 'em to take that Opportunity of getting acquainted with them. The two Brothers, though' they were very uneasy in their Minds, yet feeing the Company approach them, they recollected their ufiaal cheerful ness, and put on a Face that seemed to Speak a Heart very different from theirs.
A s loon as they were met, and had paid their respects to each other; one of the Gentlemen thus addrefs'd himself to them; * Gentlemen, we beg ‘ Leave to inform you, that you are ^ in the midst of a large wilderness; ^ and as it will be yery difficult for

* you to find your way back, and you ‘ seem Strangers to the Place, we of ‘ fer our Service to Conduct you out ‘ of it   returned this Civility with a low Bow, and Don Guzman replym, ‘ Gentlemen and La ‘ dies, we think ourselves doubly Fortunate, not only in finding a Guide ‘ out of the Labrynth, but that we ‘ have had the happiness to meet with ‘ Company that condescend to Honour ‘ us so much beyond what we either ‘ deserved or expected; we own, you ‘ have laid us under a greater Obliga ‘ tion than we are capable of return ‘ ing, but beg you would Honour us yet ‘ farther, by commanding anything in ‘ our Power, and think we shall do it ‘ with the greatefi: Satisfaction imagine ‘ able C ‘ Sir, Said one of the Gen ‘ tlemen, interrupting him, if I am too ‘ bold, Pardon me, in asking whether ‘ you are sfaniardsa ‘ We are, Sir, ‘ replied Don Antorao‘ And how ‘ long is it since you left Spam, pray ‘ G entlemen? fa id one of the Ladies \

At the Name of Alvarez they both turned Pale, and Don Guzman made Answer, ‘ Yes Ma ‘ dam, we have heard of his Misfbr ‘ tunes, and not heard only, but we ‘ have been eye witneffes of Some part ‘ of 'em, and if the Day were not al ‘ moll at an end, and the Account of ‘ them very long, I Should be very ‘ ready to give you a Relation of ‘ themh ‘ Sir, Said one of the Gen

Don Guzman, who was all this time upon the Rack, by reasbn of his Brother's Behaviour just before, and impatient for an Answer to his Qiieftion, ibiight to excuse this unexpected Invitation,
12 Wp bro THERS; Or,
vitation, by answering the Gentleman, thus; ‘ Sir, This is a favour much

‘ to be more fully acquainted with ‘ the Adventure of Don Alvarez'.
‘ Madam, replied Don Guzman, it is ‘ enough that you desire anything in ‘ our Power, we’ll be Sure to be punc ‘ toal h With Slich kind of diseourfe as this, they walked till they came to the Entrance of the Garden, where the Lady again Said, ‘ Sir, we depend

‘ upon you at three a Clock tomorrow ‘ Afternoon in this Walk‘ we’ll cer ‘ tainly do our selves the Honour,
‘ Madam, reply’d Don Guzman', and lb parted with them, and went directly with his Brother to their Lodging, where as Soon as they where sate down, they re astumed the disbourse the Company had obliged them to quit, and Don Antomo began thus. ‘ My dear. ‘ Guzman, before I ansiver your Que ‘ ftion, I must implore your Pardon ‘ for that Violation of our Friendship ‘ I have been guilty of, in So long ‘ keeping a Secret from you wherein ‘ my Honour and Reputation, as well ‘ as ease and Quiet are So highly con ‘ certed'; here he paused, and Don Guzman more amaz’d than ever, knew neither what to Say nor how to behave himself in this Dilemma; which Don Antomo taking Notice of, after a long Silence he began again thus; ‘ I See ‘ Don Guzman, the Surprise you are ‘ in, but I dare say you will be in a ‘ much greater when I tell you I am

‘ in Love'; ‘ in Love, cries Don Guz ‘ man, lifting up his Hands and Eyes; ‘ Antonio in Love! ah Antonio! how ‘ often have you blamed the unfortu ‘ nate Alvarez, and even insulted him, ‘ and made a Jeff and Scoff of his pas ‘ fion, when he Hood in more need ‘ of an asiiftant and a Comforter in ‘ his Sufferings? How often has he told ‘ you, with Tears in his Eyes, that he ‘ wdfh’d you might never be in his ‘ Condition, and at the Same time Said, ‘ he much feared you'd undergo thole ' ‘ Sufferings in your turn? Oh Guzman, ‘ Guzman, said Don Antonio, cut not ‘ my Soul in two, by Siich unkind Re ‘ flections, and Sht not the Folly of my ‘ Youth in Opposition to my present ‘ Misfortunes, which are already too ‘ insupportable; Alvarez, unfortunate ‘ Alvarez I thy prophesy is at length ‘ fulfilled, and I am the very mise ‘ rable wretched Man that thou wert; ‘ with this difference, that he that was ‘ your Friend is my Tormentor; Oh 1 ‘ Alvarez, Alvarez! unfortunate

the Tears ran down so fast that they flopp’d his utterance, and his Spirits failing him, he was seized with a trembling, which was follow’d with a cold clammy Sweat, such as often appears on a persbn just going to give up the Ghoff, and at length he fell from his Chair to the Ground, without any Signs of Life: His Brother endeavoured once or twice to raise him, but finding it was in vain, he called out for as fiftance, when the People of the Houle running upstairs, they immediately sent for a Surgeon who let him Blood, and ordered him to be put into a warm Bed, which avail’d nothing, for he continued still without Life or Motion, and his pulse had ceashd beating,
; He lay in this Condition till next Morning, when the Surgeon coming. to visit him, felt of his Heart, and told them he had Life in him; and by applying warming Medicines, they brought him to himself in about half

an Hour's Time, when looking about him he was amazed to She So many People in the Room, and fixing his Eyes upon his Brother, defied him to bid all the others withdraw, and whent the Room was clear, he calpd his Brother to him, and Saidj ‘ What are you ‘ doing with me, and where am I? Is it ‘ not enough that I have been in Tor ‘ ments these many Days, but must ‘ you call me back to renew them, by ‘ beholding the persbn that delights ‘ to heighten them and triumph in ‘ them V Don Guzman, though' these Reproaches wounded him very much, yet fearing that to expostulate with him might occasion a relapse, reply ‘ My Antomo, I own your Reproaches ‘ are just, but if you can forgive my first ‘ Offence, you Shall always hereafter ‘ find me willing and ready to Serve you, ‘ to the iitmoft of my Power; I acknow* ‘ ledge my Fault, and stand leif con ‘ demn'd; let me therefore render my ‘ seif someway Serviceable to you, that ‘ I may merit my Pardon, and expiate

companied his Brother to the Place appointed, where the Company was waiting for them. As Soon as the Gentlemen see   coming, one of them pulled a Key out of his Pocket, and opening a little Door they had never before obterved, they went through' it, and the Gentleman very carefully Shut it after him. They pass'd through" a great many fine Walks, and came to a very stately Building, that wanted nothing to rhake it Magnificent; as loon as they were come into the Hall,
rd
they, were welcomed by a Conlbrt of Music, composed of the best Masters n Dance; which was no Sooner ended, but they were led into a Room, that looked out into a very beautiful Garden, much exceeding any they had ever teen; the Room which was very large, was wainteoated with Cedar, and adorned with teveral of the best Performances of Michael Angelo, Raphael Urban, and other incomparable Masters in the Art of Painting, and on the Floor was laid a Carpet of Cloth of

  Don Alvarez.
DO N Diego de Torellas, the Father of this unfortunate Man, married a Lady of extraordinary Birth and Fortune, by whom he had two Sons,  the Subject of my present discourse, and Don seha sit an, and a Daughter named Mariana, Their Father tenderly load Alvarez znd Mariana, and as much diflik’d 6^ bajitany who on the other hand, was the Mother's Darling, Settled the Estate upon Alvarez in such a Manner, that in case he died before that time, his Son Alvarez Should enter into theposteijion

of it at the Age of Twenty, paying out of it a thousand Crowns a Year to his
fi' '
Mariana during her Life: He bad not long Settled it, before he died, leaving his Wife Icile Guardian over his three Children who were very young j she finding in what Posture Affairs stood, could no longer endure the sight of Don Alyafez and his Sister Mariana, because sehafhan had no o there Proviston made for him, but Part of her Jointure, which was fettled upon the second Son, at Marriage.
Her distike to Alvarez especially, grew by Degrees to an irreconcilable hatred, So that at Seventeen Years of Age his Mother was resblved to Send him to the West Indies, under a Pretence of being super intendent oyer a Small Plantation, that his Father had purchased a little before his Death; but in reality, in hopes that the change of Air, or the Danger of the Seas might kill him. ion Alvarez, as Soon as he was acquainted with his Mother's pro pofal, well perceived her Intent, and
therefore

therefore found it was in vain to contradict it, as her Power over him was absolute, but he took it So much to Heart that he was Seized with a violent Fit of illness; notwithstanding which, his cruel Mother ordered him, when the Distemper was at the very Crisis, to be carried on board a Ship, that Set Sail immediately for India; but, as it pleas’d Almighty God, the change of Air had a quite different Effect upon him, for in three Days time, he was able to get up, and walk about upon the Deck, and in a Short time after, recover’d perfectly of his indispofition.
But it was not long after his Recovery, that there arose Such a violent Tempest, that they were obliged to fling most Part of their Lading overboard, and all to no purpose; for in about five Hours afterwards, the Ship was dashed to Pieces against a Rock, and every Soul drowned but Don AL varez, who being an excellent Swimmer, bore himieif above the Waves, for about three Hours • when the Tem

pest abating, and the Waters beginning to ebb, he was left upon the Top of the Rock, from whence he could see, at a great distance, the dead Bodies of his fellow fufferers, Scattered here and there upon the Surface of the Water.
The Waters by Degrees were lb far gone from the Rock, that Don Aharez looking about him. Saw Several Parcels of Goods up and down upon the Sides of it, and, among the rest, his own Chest where his Effects were; but what avail Clothes to the Hungry, or Riches to the Thirsty, when they will neither procure them Meat nor Drink : aha’ rez regardless of his Riches, hunted up and down the Rock, fearcffd every Hole and Corner of it, and broke open all the Chests, to find where withal to Satisfy his hungry Belly, that calpd loud from within for Something to nourish and support it; at last he found a Parcel of Biskets, at the Bottom of a Bundle of Rags, that Seenfd to belong to a common Sailor; neyer was Man So

rejoiced; he thought Providence had now doubly paid him for all his misfortunes, and given him ample Satisfaction for all the Injuries he had received from the too boisterous and raging Ocean; he made a hearty Meal out of Some of them, and wrapped the rest up, very carefully, in the same old Rags, and laid them in a Corner of the Rock : Thus heartned, he proceeded in his search about the Rock, and found the Boat that belonged to the Ship with one Oar in it, this inlpir’d him with Some hopes of efbaping; but not being able to push it into the Water, he carried his Biskets into it, and looking into his Chest, he found his Clothes, and a Casket of Jewels his Father had given him upon his Deathbed, with about fifteen hundred Crowns in Money : He carried the Jewels and Money into the Boat, with a few of his Clothes which were dryest, and Searching narrowly, he found the other Oar that belong’d to the Boat.

Being thus equipp’d, it was not long before the Tide riling again, it took up his Boat, and he put to Sea; three Days he kept rowing up and down, without knowing in what Part he was engaged, and with hard working and dry Victuals, he was almost parch’d with Thirst; when faint and weary, he dropm his Oars, and laying himseif all along in the Boat, he turned his Ryes up to Heaven, and erym out with a loud Voice; ‘ Thou great dis^ ‘ poser of all human Events, whole < overruling Providence directs wffiat ‘ ever was, is, or Shall be performm, ^ look with an Eye of Pity upon me! ‘ and deliver me from this Misery h He had no Sooner Spoke these Words, but his eyelids closed, and he fell into a deep steep; how long he continued in it he could not tell,. but as Soon as he waked, getting up and looking about him, he Spied Land to his great Joy and. Comfort, and plying his Oars briskly, he found himseif in half an Hour, upon the Coast of Spain; he

soon got his Clothes, Jewels, and Money out of the Boat, and going to a • neighbouring Town, he bought himself a fine horsfe, with very rich Furniture, and another for a Servant, which he Soon after hirm; and not caring to be known, he chang’d his Name to Gioannes del Oceano; and being pretty well versed in the Italian Language, he passm for an Italian Nobleman; in this Manner he let forward for Madrid, where he arrived in ten Days.
He made himseif known directly to Don Ftelix, who lived directly opposite to his Mother, and acquainted him with his manner of Departure, and the Variety of Adventures he had met with in his Short Voyage; the old Gentleman, who pasiionately loved him, entertained him very magnificently, under the borrowed Title of the Italian Nobleman; he provided him with a fumptuolis Equipage, and all things suitable to a ?erfon of his Rank and f^ality.

IT was presently noise in Madrid that a young Italian Count was arrived; upon which, as it is the Custom, all the Nobility and Gentry, except thole of the graver Sort, waited upon him to pay him their respects, and among the Rest, his Brother Don Sebafiian, who was reckon’d one of the richest Gentlemen in the City, came to Visit him : when after a little indifferent Dif
V
course, the Count (for So I intend to call him hereafter) asicd him whether he had a Father alive, he told the Count, no, the old Fellow dym when he was very young; ‘ And, Says ‘ the Count, have you no Sisters nor ‘ Brothers?' ‘ Sisters, my Lord, Said ‘ Don Sehaftian, I have one, and Bro ‘ thers, I had one, a very vicious de ‘ bauch’d rascal as ever the Sun ‘ Shone upon, but his Mother Sent him ‘ to Sea, for fear he Should make me ‘ as bad as himseif, and good Provi ‘ dence has order’d it So, that he was ‘ cast away about three Months ago, ‘ by which Means I come into the
‘ Estate,
Don Alvarez.
‘ Estate, for you must know, he was ‘ the eldest of us, and my Father, like ‘ a foolish old Dotard, fettled all the * Estate upon him, and I must have ‘ been glad to have come off with a ‘ younger Brother's Share, if he hadn’t ‘ been very luckily drowned'. The Count to hear his Father's Ashes called in question, and himieif vilified in So unjust a manner, was just going to lay his Hand upon his Sword, and Sacrifice his Brother upon the Spot; but. considering the Disturbance it would make in the City, and the Stain it would cast upon the house of the good Don Ftelix, as well as the Reflection it would be upon his own Character, he check’d his rising Choler; though' in struggling with it, he could not help giving visible Proofs of the Effect it had upon him. However, Don sehajhan took.no notice of it, but went on with a great deal more of the lame Sort of difcourse, till other Vifiters coming in interrupted them; and among the rest, Don yuan, with his v^fife and Daughter,

But to continue. The (Count had no Sooner fixed his Eyes upon her, but he felt a pasiion he was before a Stranger to; his Pulse beat high, his Eyes wandered up and down the Room in a confused mannetj and could fix nowhere but upon the adorable Leonora: (for that was the Ladies Name) In short, he was fb captivated with her, that he had almost: forgot to Salute her Father and Mother; however, he collected himseif at last, and making a faint Apology for his Confusion, that did but betray it the more, and make the Company take the more notice of it, he defied 'em to Set down, when the cunning old Man, who brought his Daughter with him on purpose to
make

make a Match of it, perceiving how far her presence had already influenc’d the j Count, Sbated her directly opposite to him, that he might take the fuller view of her, and presently afters her Mother Said to her; ‘ Leonora, that ‘ Veil is very thick and heavy, I won ‘ der how you can wear it; an't you ‘ very hot in it? I think its enough to ‘ llifle you; I have one that's much ‘ thinner and lighter in my Pocket,
‘ pull that off, and put it on'. ‘ If
‘ you please Mamma', Says Leonora, and pulling off her Veil, disbover'd a Face So admirably Charming, Such Sparkling Eyes! Such exact Symmetry of Features! and a Complexion lb exquisitely Beautiful, whereon Nature had bellow’d her most: killing White and Red, that the Count was ten times more wounded than before, but being aware of the cause, he concealed the Effect better than when he was slir prism by an unexpected Attack: However, the old Man pleased himseif, with Seeing that a Sight of her Face

The Count could not Sleep a wink all that Night, and remembering that he engaged himieif to breakfast with my Father the next Morning, he got Up Iboner than usiial, and came lb early, that my Father, who had not been very Well the Night before, was not stirring, So Sent us downstairs to entertain his Guest, till he had drer led himseif, and was fit to appear:
We went down to him, and excused our Father's stay, buthe without make ing any Answer, let drop a few Tears, which were followed by these Words :

The old Gentleman was well pleased to hear the Count's Sentiments, and made him this Reply. ‘ My Lord, You honour ‘ my Daughter and me very much, in ‘ what you propose, and if you can ‘ find anything in her that can merit

You may imagine, Ladies, it was not long before he confirmed his success, by an Interview with Leonora, who though She found everything that was desirable in the persbn of the Count, and had always entertained a fecrec respect for him, yet received his ad dreffcs with an Air of Indifference, the whole Sex is Subject to, but especially the Spamjh Ladies, and if She gave him any Liberties, she made him understand, it was only by the Command of her Father, that oblig’d her to entertain him in lb free a manner. The Count continued this Way of Life above a Year, and the Treaty of Marriage was lb near concluded, that the wedding day was fix*d, when thefa

This vexed the old Man to the Heart, but thinking to be revenged on the Count a better way, would not let him know that his Roguery was found out, but told his Daughter how it was, and withal, commanded her not to think of him any more as a Husband, but to receive the addrestes of Don sehajuan, wh(0 had often been teasing of him before In that Affair, ^ but to no Purppfe; and at the lame time, to carry a fair Face to the Count. Leonora, who loved the Count persbn, and not his Title or Fortune, was Sbrely troubled in her Mind, tek think that he had six far deceived, her Father, that there was no i^robability of a Reconciliation; but witbak know ing her Father's dcspotick Temper, ^^ date not dilbbey him, but was obliged to receive the Man to her bosbm that

she always had an Aversion tbo; and reject him She valu’d above all the World. The old Man soon found out an excuse for deferring the Marriage, and one Day, when the Count and he Wterc together, ‘ My Lord, says he, ‘ I atn very much concern’d to think ‘ I must defer the time apj^ointed to ‘ make my Seif happy in such a Son; ‘ but looking among Some Writings ‘ Yesterday, I found her Grandfathers

The Count was very much disturb’d by this Disappointment, and Soon found, by the Behaviour of Leonora (who could not act her Part Sb well as her Father) and the frequent visits of his Brother Don sehafhan, at Don Juan's House, that Ibmething more than he was aware of was in Hand; and one Day in his diseourfe with Leonora, he observ’d the Tears Hand in her Eyes, and that She very often stifl’d a Sigh, which seem’d to come from the Bottom of her Heart, and would fain have gain’d a Passage thro’ her Mouth, but was hinder’d by the Opposition it met with from her; upon which he press’d her very much to reveal what hung lb heavy upon her Mind, making use of all the pasiionate Expressions Love could Suggest to him, offering his Service if anything he could do could make her easy, and protesting his Readiness

diness to be asiiftant to her as far as it lay in his Power, even to the Danger of his Life; but all in vain, till at last, the Contest betwixt Love and Duty

was decided, and Love got the Victory, which forc’d out these broken Accents with a Flood of Tears: ‘ My ‘ Lord, if So I may yet call you, it is ‘ a great Grief and Vexation to me,

‘ Leonora's Father will certainly forget ‘ this, when he finds me in the very ‘ Same Circumstances sehafhan is at ‘ present Master of.
In the midst of these Meditations, Don Juan came into the Room, and reading in his Face the disbrder of his Mind; ‘ My Lord, said he, I hope ‘ your Lordstiip's well; your Lord ‘ Ship Ibems to be fbmething indir ‘ pos’d This Banter of the old Man's, cut the Count to the very Soul, and be was just going down on bis Knees, to confess who he was, and ix^g his Pardon; but recollecting Leonora had

told him, that her Father had charg’d her not to undeceive him, he turn’d it off, by telling him, he had been very ill the Night before with a Pain in his Head, and that it was just then return’d upon him. The old Man took this Excuse for Reality, and fell into a great deal of discourie concerning the City of Rome, and ask’d him Several Questions concerning Things which he being unacquainted with, return’d liieh half answers, that Don Juan found his Correspondent had inform’d him of the Truth, and the Count eastly perceiv’d he was detected in Several Instances, but did not care to make himieif known at that time, and So parted a little disturbed at this Adventure.
When Supper was ready, Don Fte jix, as usiial, came and sat down to the Table with him, and law Discontent wrote in large Characters in his Forehead; but talcing no Notiee till after Supper, when the Servants had, taken way, he laid : ‘ My Lord, I ‘ fear something is the Matter with

Don Alvarez thank’d him for his kind Wilh, and being seated Don Ftelix took him by the Hand, and laid, ‘ Alvarez, ^ when your Father lay upon his ^ deathbed, he beckon’d me to him,

The Count and Do Ftelix both wept at reading this; the one for the Lois of Sb good a Father, the other for the loss of lb dear a Friend; but drying up their Tears they pursii’d the Will, which entitled Don Aharez to an Estate of seventy thousand Crowns per Annum; this gavq him the greater Joy, in hopes that Don Juan would be the Iboner tempted by such an Estate, to forgive him, and receive him as his Son, forgetting his former Fault in deceiving him.
They were Interrupted in their Bufineft by a Servant, that acquainted them the Company was come, and

When Dinner was ended, Healths began to go round to the Noble Count Givannes del Oceano, wishing him many happy Years, and a great deal of such Formality; which the (dount hearing, he rose from the Table, and with a Solemn Air express’d himsfelf in this Manner; ‘ My noble and worthy ‘ Friends, I return you my hearty ‘ Thanks, for the Honour you do me,

Though this Behaviour of Don Sebastian, much llirprized the whole Company, yet it did not hinder them from inquiring into the manner of his Deliverance, from the Shipwreck, and his Adventures Since; which he to pleasure them recounted to them, omitting his Conversation with his Brother, and that Part, where Leonora tells him what her Father had commanded her, with the Contents of his father’s bundle of Papers; but when he enter’d into that Part of his Affection for Leonora, he exprcfs’d himself, in a Manner, that fully Showed the Anguifti of his Heart for losing her, which made all the Company intercede with Don Juan in his behalf, and especially Don ialix, who Said to him; ‘ Don Juan, You ‘ see with how much Sincerity Aharez ‘ has explain’d himseif, and aefcnow ‘ ledge his Fault, in deceiving the

'Both Leonora and Alvarez, thank’d Don faix and Don Juan on their Knees, for their Goodness, and the Company parted very well pleas’d, to see Things brought to this happy • Conclusion. Don Juan appointed the Monday following for the wedding day, and Donna Teresa invited her Son Alvarez to take a Dinner with her the next Day.
Don Alvarez went to Bed very well delighted with the Success of the Day, and about Noon, the Day after, paid a Visit to his Mother, according to her Invitation the Night before; Dinner was brought on to Table, and they were sate down, wdien the Gentleman came in, that had been before appointed of the Mother, who being invited to sit down, drew” a Chair so close to  that he, to disengage himfctf, endeavour’d to pull

‘ and when you have difpatch’d him,
‘ take my Daughter as a Reward for ‘ the Service you have done me
At Dinner Lorenzo came in, and the Mother had contriv’d the Table, as I have told you, which was fatal to dortmlvarez, but much more fatal to Don Lorenzo; for Mariana would not so much as look upon her brother’s Murderer, but chose rather to Shut herself up in a Convent, than be Married to the Man she abhorrm.
This drove Lorenzo Mad, and in his Intervals, being touch’d with Remorse of Conscience, he went to a Magistrate, and' made Confession that he had hir’d two Villains, to hold Don Jlvarez hdt, while he run him through the Body. The Villains were apprehended, and confefs’d the Fact, upon which they were bang’d; and Don Lorenzo being the Principal

in the Murder, was broke upon the Wheel; a deferv’d Execution for such unheartof complicated Acts of Wicked nefs.
Donna Teresa dy’d sometime before this, and Don Sebafiian liv’d not long, to enjoy the Fruits of so much Wickedness;; being Married to Leonora, tho’ with visible Regret 6n her Part, he was ehoaked, as he "was at Supper, on bis Wedding night, by endeavouring to Swallow with too great hasie, one of the Small Bones in the Breast of a Lark. Leonora is now mifiress of that fine Efface, and of Consequence is, continually teiz’d with. Suitors, among which are several of the best: Quality insfain; but She will give no Encouragement to any of them, and burying herself front the World, ihe is continually wishing that Death would release her from her Pains, and bring her to the Sight of her Jivarez, once more.
Don Guzman concluded his Story with visible Demonftrarions of
F 2 Grief,
/
cs The
Grief, for his departed Friend, in which he was joined by the whole Company, who condemn’d the bafe nefs of Lorenzo, and his Mother, and lamented the hard Cafe of Leonora; which a Gentleman in the Company observing, said; ‘ I see. Ladies ‘ and Gentlemen, how much this ‘ Melancholy Story has affected you, ‘ but that you may not return Home ‘ in this dejected Condition, if you’ll ‘ walk a little farther with me, there’s ‘ something to be seen that, perhaps, ^ may afford you a little Diversion ’: thecompany follow’d him, and they pafs’d thro’ several ffately Rooms, till they came to a long Gallery, thro’ which they went, and at the upper end, there was a pair of Stairs, that led up to a kind of Theatre, where there were Several Seats and a Stage with a Curtain down; here the Company plac’d themselves, and upon the gentleman’s ringing alittlebell, themuficians came and play’d the Overture; after which, was the Curtain drawn up, and they

78 The Bko THERS : Or,
When this Entertainment was ended, the Company went to Supper; after which, Don Guzman and Don!, Antomo, went home to Bed; where, Don Antonio could not get one wink of Sleep, but sent out Sighs that would have melted the most stony Hearts to Compaftion; which were now and then follow’d by the Name of Elmira; and again, ‘ ah base and too ‘ forward Clariana'*,
D ON Guzman at hearing the Name of Elmira, soon found out whence he deriv’d, that Paction that so tormented him.
This Elmira was a Lady lately come to Town, and had taken Lodgings, directly over against those of  ; She came last from Madrid thither for the Diversion of the French Court: She was perfectly beautiful, and wasmiftrefs ofa sprightly Wit, and exuberant Fancy, which She very discreetly held in, by the Reins of Judgement and Prudence.
Next
I
 jhi. 7 9
Next Door to her, liv’d Clariana, a Lady of a tolerable Share of Wk, but She made use of it, so muchj everywhere, and upon all Occasions, in all Company, that everybody soon grew weary of her, but this Spamjb Lady; who, tho’ she did not much admire her Conversation, but being a Stranger in the City, and not acquainted with anybody elfe, She us’d to pafs away a tew Hours, now and then, with her, for want of better Company.
Don Guzman was as deeply wounded widi elmird.s Beauty, as Don Antonio, and was often going to declare his pasiion to him, but one Thing or other interfering, he never had an: Opportunity for it; which he was exceedingly glad of; and judging, by his Brothers outward Uneasiness, that his inward Grief proceeded from Elmira's disdain, he inferr’d from thence, that it was not yet too late to make his addreftes, and insinuate himself into her Favour; with these kind of Thoughts he pleas’d himself, till considering
8o Tfe  ,
I
fidering on the other Hand, that £/ mird.s Behaviour towards Don Antonio, might be only a Trial of his Love, he wasworfe tormented than hisbrothcr. Thus they spent the Night in uneali^ nefs, and as soon as Day appeared; they got up, and took a walk out, to divert the Torments they labour’d under,
They walk’d alongtimetogether without changing a Word, till Don an tonio recovering himself from the profound Thoughts he was engag’d in, he turn’d to his Brother and, embracing him tenderly, said; ‘ My dear Guzmun, ‘ by ourfriendfhipas wellias Kindred,! by those Promises youfo lately renewed, and by the Confidence I have al ‘ ways repos’d in you; I conjure you, ‘ and entreat you, to assist me in an ‘ Affair, in which without your help, ^ I must inevitably be disappointed ^ I am certain, will be the Death ‘ of the Man that values you beyond ‘ all the World’. Don Guzman, who guefs’d what would follow, the better

 jpl Si
to deceive him, Said; ‘ My Aritomo; ‘ why will you still be tormenting me ‘ with those pressing Instances df my ^ Kindred, Friendship and Proniifes? ‘ Is it that you fdfpect I Shall deceive ‘ you? Or think you, I have already ‘ forgot, how much I am bc)und to ‘ you in Gratitude, for the many kihd ‘ ncflcs I have receiv’d from you?
* Can you not at once tell me what
* you would have me do to serve you? ‘ It is enough that you desire it tell ‘ me what it is, and if it lies in my ‘ Power, think it done I thank ‘ you, my best of Friends reply’d ‘ Don Antomo \ and since ydii. deflre
^ mcj I shall say nothing further itl ' Regard of your Friendship and 3iii
* cerity, which I never had any Rea ‘ fon to call in quefifon; but begirt ‘ to inform you of the Gauies of my ‘ present Condition, and Show yoii ‘ flow far you cart be serviceable to ‘ me in it.

‘you may remember, ond Eveh
* ing about a Mondi or six Weeks ago;
G ‘ you
82  ,
* you went to the Play, and! engag’d ‘ myself to spend the Evening with
* Monsieur St. Loe, at the popps Head;
: and according to my Appointrnent, I
went thither; wdiere, after having ‘ waited about an Hour for him, he ‘ sent his Servant to beg my Pardon, ‘ and that he could not pofhbly wait ‘ on me, because he expected some ‘ Friends to come to Town in the ‘ Stagecoach that Night; but that ‘ if I would come thither, he Should ‘ take it as a great Favour. I went ‘ immediately to him, where his ‘ Friends, with the rest of the Paf ‘ fengers, were just alighting out of the ‘ Coach, as I came in; among which ‘ was the beautiful Elmira: I no sooner ‘ beheld her, but like Aharez,, I was ‘ so deeply wounded by those power ‘ full Charms with which She was ‘ arm’d, that not withstanding all the ‘ Reason I could Summon up to my ‘ Aid, I found my Wound too deep f for any other Remedy, but what [ Ihe could afford it. As soon as the
^ paftengers
«
 tjed. s5
‘ paftengers had paid their Fare, and ‘ refresh’d themselves a little, Elrntra ‘ began to inquire whither they could ^ let her have a Lodging; the Master ‘ of the Inn told her, that all the Beds ‘ in his House were taken up, by the
* paftengers that were to go in the ‘ Coach the next Morning; butifftie ‘ pleased to accept of halt' a Bed, he ‘ would lie with the Hostler, and ‘ ftie might lie with his Wife: the ‘ Lady, who did not much like such ‘ a bedfellow, thank’d him for his ‘ kind offer, and told him, she had ‘ much rather have a Bed to herself, ‘ inquiring whether fly could not
* get a Lodging at another Part of ‘ the Town’. vmadam, said Ijiflatn ‘ not too bold in offering to concern ‘ my self in your Affairs, as you seem ‘ to be a Person of some Quality, I can ‘ recommend you to the House of a
* Gentlewoman, that this Gentleman ‘ is intimately acquainted with’. ‘ Who is that, pray Sir, said Monsieur ‘ St. Los ‘ It is Madam de Tourney;
G 2 ‘ Sir,
f
84 The B R o thers: Or,
‘ Sir, anfvvered I, and I am sure she’ll ‘ use the Lady well, and has all the ‘ Conveniences that a Person of the ‘ best Quality can defire’. ‘ Madam I ‘ de Tourney, Said monsieur St. Loe, ‘ is a Person, that if I wanted a Lodg ‘ ing for the king’s Brother, I would ‘ recommend • the Rooms are large, ‘ spacious and magnificent; the Fur ‘ niture all new fafbion’d, and very ‘ Grand, and She herself is a very well ^ bred polite Lady, but being reduc’d! by Misfortunes, is obligm, to let ‘ out Part of her House, for a Sub ‘ fiftence, having nothing in the ‘ World besides to depend upon, Gen. ‘ tlemen, said Elmira, I return you,
* a thousand Thanks for this Favour,
* and if it won’t be too much trouble, I should beunder an infinite Obliga
* tion to you, if you’d please to con ‘ duct me thither ‘ We both im ^ ‘ mediately offer’d our Service, but. ‘ I begg’d the Lady to accept of me, ‘ informing her at the same Time,, ‘ that the other Gentleman was en.
‘ gag’d
I
 jhi. 85
‘ gag’d to the rest of Ladies that were ‘ then present. She accepted of me,
‘ and we took Coach to Madam de ‘ Tournefs House; where the Lady ‘ approving of the Lodgings, agreed ^ with her for them, and said to me,
‘ Sir, I beg I may no longer detain ‘ you from your Company, I am infinitely obliged to you, and return ■ you many thanks’. ‘ Madam, said I, ^ I can be nowhere so much engag’d ‘ to any Company, as to leave a Lady ^ just come to a Strange Place, without ‘ taking care to see everything pro
* for her. She thank’d me, and ‘ I order’d a Supper to be got ready * ‘ and while it was drefting, she ask’d ^ me several Qyeftions, concerning the ‘ City of Verfallies, the Nature of the ‘ Climate, the Genius of the People, ^ their way of Dress and Conversation, ‘ and a great deal more of the like ‘ sort, to which I answered as well as
* I could; and among the rest, she ‘ ask’d me, whether I was a Spaniard, \ I told her I was ^ I thought so, Sir,
G L [ really.
84  ; Or,
‘ really, says she, because you talk the Spamjb so very fluently, and I ‘ thought you spoke the French a little ‘ imperrect, when you were with the ‘ Gentleman at the Inn’, ‘ I then ‘ told her my Name, and that I lived ‘ over the Way, and the Reason of my ‘ stay inverfallies.
‘ With a great deal of such indif ‘ ferent Dlfcourfe we pafs’d away the ‘ Evening, and it was very late before ‘ we parted, when she invited me to ‘ breakfast with her the next Morn ‘ ing; I went as She had appointed ‘ me, and by degrees becoming more ‘ clcquainted, I paid her a Visit very of ‘ ten; and one Day as we were walk ‘ ing very seriously in the Garden, I ‘ let fall a Sigh, which she observing, ‘ ask’d rne, what could be the Cause
* it’? ‘ Madam, said I, yourque^ ‘ ftion has obliged me to disclose, what ‘I had other wife for ever kept a Secret from you and all the World. ‘ There is a Lady not far from where
* you live, that is juftjy efteem’d the
 jhi, ' 87
* most accomplish’d of her Sex; she ‘ has Beauty, good Sense, Virtue, ‘ and whatever is requisite to make
* her the most perfect of woman kind; ‘ Thousands fall Victims to her Beauty
every Day: She never is seen with ‘ out gaining the Hearts of all that ‘ behold her; and among so many
* Lovers as fall a Sacrifice to her every ‘ Moment, I do my self the Honour ^ to esteem my self one; I, who have ‘ ever bid defiance to the Power of the ‘ fair Sex, and flood Proof against ‘ those Charms, by whose Influence ‘ Thousands have fallen on both fides ^ of me, am at last fully punifh’d for ‘ my Affront to the whole Sex, by ‘ the most glorious Beauty of it’. ‘ But, Sir, said she, why should you ■* conceal a Palfion, that must either ‘ be utter’d, to give ease to the Heart ^ that harbours it, or like a Spark of ‘ Fire among unkindled Fuel, by de ‘ grees fet fire to, and consume the ‘ whole ’: ^ Madam, said I, it is not

^ so much as the Conversation of a ‘ Man of Sense: : flatter my self I ‘ am not the only one, that has been ‘ guilty of a little Indiscretion that ‘ way; or, if I am, I think my self ‘ sufficiently acquitted to the World, ‘ when it understands, that Don An ‘ tonio is the Person; and under a ‘ Name so universally belov’d, I ‘ doubt not my Sex will suffer me to ‘ Shelter, without the Imputation of ^ any Breach of Modefiy: I confess ‘ I am a little too free, in giving my ‘ self these Liberties; I own, I ought to have been a little more referv’d ‘ in Things of this Nature; but then, ‘ if I do undergo any Censure upon ‘ that account, I think my self fully ‘ repaid, by tne Conversation of the ‘ Man, Iimufl: say, I respect and esteem ‘ far beyond all the rest of the Sex ‘ She said this, with such a flattering ‘ Tone, and at the same Time look’d ‘ me lb impudently full in the Face, ‘ that I could hardly forbear being ‘ down right rude, and affronting her at

‘ once; but considering she had so ‘ much Influence over the incomparable Elmira, that I should do my ‘ self an Injury, and leften her Opinion ‘ of me, if 1 did anything contrary to ‘ the Character She had often given ‘ me, of my self; I made fbist to ‘ contain my self, but couldn’t help ‘ answering her in the following man ‘ ner: ’ ‘ Lord, Madam 1 what oc ‘ cafion is there for all these Apo ‘ logics? Or, in what can the World ‘ blame you? If you have any Business with me, or, Commands for ‘ me, am I to blame in obeying them? ^ Or, you in enjoining them? The ‘ World is too well convinc’d of your ‘ Modesty and Virtue, to think, that ‘ Clariana can be guilty of epnverfing ^ with any Man alive, in a manner, ‘ that is not within the strictest ‘ bounds of them both; let not there ‘ fore the Opinion of the World ‘ disturb you, or give you any Un ‘ easiness. Madam; and if you have ^ any Employment for me, I shall

‘ chearfuliy and readily undertake it
‘ and endeavour to serve you to the ‘ best of my Capacity in it ^ or, if ‘ you have anything to propose, that ‘ is within my Comprehension, I am ‘ at your Service always, to resolve ‘ you, and satisfy you in it ‘ This ‘ I see vex’d Clariana, who didn’t much ‘ care to be so closely dealt with, in ‘ Regard to her Virtue and Modelfy ♦
‘ however. She had mufter’d up some ‘ thing to say, but was hinder’d by the ‘ Servants bringing in Supper; I was ‘ glad of this, and perceiving She ‘ would renew her Attacks, when Sup ‘ per was over, as soon as I had eat ‘ a little, and drank a Glass of Wine,
^ I look’d at my Watch, and darting ‘ up from the Table, said. Dear ‘ Madam, I humbly crave your Par ‘ don, but I can’t possibly stay, ’tis ^ now past Ten, and I should have met > ‘ some Gentlemen of my own Coun ‘ try at nine o’clock, that are to leave ‘ Verfallies tomorrow Morning very 1= early, I wish I may get my Money of ....

‘ ‘em before they go out of Town’. ‘ Since your businefs is of such Northeast ‘ cellity, Sir, said she, I can’t desire you
* to stay any longer now; but, I hope, ' you’ll make me amends by another ^ Vifit’. ‘ Madam, reply’d I, I can’t ‘ promise certainly how soon I can do ‘ my self that Honour; but you need ‘ not doubt I shall embrace the first ‘ Opportunity’. ‘ 1 then took my ‘ leave of her, and as I went down ‘ Stairs, I heard her sigh, and say, ah ^ Don Antonio! Don Antomo \ ’ ‘ I ‘ went away very discontented, and ‘ furpriz’d at such immodest Behaviour ‘ in a young Lady; and judging of all ‘ the rest of the French Ladies by her, ‘ could not help condemning the ‘ frcnr/i Method of Education of them, ‘ and thinking their Parents were ‘ much to blame, in not instilling in
* them the Principles of Modesty, ‘ before they came to that Age. But ‘ I have since obferv’d, that we ought ‘ never to judge of the whole Nation, [ by what wc see in two or three In
‘ stances:
 jmd, i o i
‘ stances; for to give the French ‘ Ladies their due, the generality opem ‘ areas modest and referv’d, as those of ‘ any Nation in the World ^ tho’ I think ‘ it a little unbecoming, that they ‘ appear, in the most Public Places ‘ in the City without Veils ’. ‘ Bro
‘ there, said Don Guzman, we ought ‘ never to make general Inferences, ‘ from, particular Instances; nortore ‘ stect upon a whole, Nation, for the ‘ Vice or Indiscretion of any un ‘ worthy Member of it *, you know, ‘ there are Ladies in Sfain that are as ‘ immodest, and more, than Clariana, ‘ notwithstanding their Veils; which ‘ only serves to make them the bolder, ‘ by screening their blushes from the ‘ observation of the Company: As for ‘ the use of Veils, its only a Custom ‘ that has been long among the Spam ‘ ards, which makes it uncommon and ‘ preposterous for a Woman to ap ‘ pear without them, and it would ‘ be more preposterous in a Lady of ‘ any other Nation, to appear with
U 2 "’em.

‘ ’em. But pray proceed in your Relati ‘ on? I will, reply’d Don Antomo, and ‘ said, i refolv’d from that Time to ‘ avoid clariand.s Company as much ‘ as possible, fur the future, and to ‘ give her no more Opportunities of ‘ inviting me to come to Supper with ‘ her; but the next Morning feeling ‘ in my Pocket for my Handkerchief, ‘ I found the following Letter.
Clariana to Von Antonio.
lnfe}7jlble Ant o n i o,
‘ 'ELL me whether it is, that ‘ j. you can’t ’ approve of me, or ‘ are you in reality such a Novice in ‘ Love, as to overlook those apparent ‘ Signs of it in Clariana: I think it ‘ very manifestly fhew’d it self, in so ‘ many Instances, that you must have ‘ seen how great my Affection was for ‘ you, unless you Shut the Eyes of ‘ your Head, as well as those of your ‘ deictanding, the whole Time you ‘ were last in my Company.

‘ You may rcis aftur’d, that it has ‘ very much incensed me, to think, ‘ that when I had done more for the ‘ sake of a Man, than is consonant ‘ to my own Reason, as well as that ‘ Virtue, which is the chiefeft Orna ‘ ment of our Sex • when I had drawn ‘ to the utmost, and even exceeded ‘ the Bounds of Modesty; to think, ‘ I Say, that I Should be slighted by ‘ the very Man, for whom I have ‘ done all this; Oh, it provokes me to ‘ the last Degree, and I almost re ‘ solve to offer no more Terms, but at ‘ once Satisfy my Love and Revenge, ‘ by conferring condign Punishment ‘ upon the Offender, that dares be ‘ guilty of such Crimes,
‘ Think not, because I am a Wo ‘ man, that I am destitute of Means ‘ to punish you; no, careless Man, ‘ Revenge is sweet, and the offended ‘ Person will soon find a Weapon to ‘ do the Execution.
‘ How everjifyou recant in Time, ‘ and make amends for your last Visit,

‘ I may yet Pardon you; but think
® not that I v/ili long bear with your
^ unconcern’d way of Carriage towards
^ me.

‘ Take heed therefore, least you ‘ find in the End, how hard it is ^ to bear the Effect of a woman’s ‘ Anger, and wish, when its too late, ‘ you had not trifled with the then ‘ inexorable, but now forgiving
Clariana,
‘ I was ten times more confounded ‘ than before, when I found these
■ but feeing they were written ‘ by a Woman, tofs’d betwixt those ^ headstrong Passions of Love, ^ Jealousy, Despair, and Revenge, I ^ knew it was impossible to send her ‘ an Answer that could pacify her, “without giving her what is out of ‘ my Power to give; and therefore I

■ h\\t if She ever hinted anything to me
^ concerning

'concerning it, to affure her I never ‘ either receiv’d nor saw it.
‘ I WENT the next Day to Elmira, ‘ but did not mention a Word of ‘ Clariana^ Passion for me, and con ‘ tinned my Visits several Days toge ‘ iher, and Clariana took care to ‘ follow me constantly thither, when
* she had any Intelligence I was ® there; one Day in particular, as I ^ was going into the Room, where ‘ there was a Screen that parted the ‘ Door from the Company, I heard
* from behind it, c/amna mighty high ‘ in Discourse about Don Antonio; the ‘ Shelter of the Screen tempted me to ‘ listen to her a little, and I soon found ^ the old Proverb true, that, Liftners ‘ never hear any good of themselves;; ‘ the first Word that Saluted my
* Ears was from Elmira, who said to ‘ Qlariana!, ^andisdonantomoxe^illy ‘ a Fortune hunter? Madam, said ‘ Clariana, he never told me so, but ■ I have heard it from very good
Hands; Persons that I kjiow would
‘ scorn
u.

‘ scorn to tell a Lye, that affirms, that ‘ both he and his Brother are such ‘ sort of People; and I have been told
* by several Persons that he has made ‘ his addreftes to five several Ladies ‘ at a time, since his arrival at Ver ‘ failles; nay, I have been advis’d my ‘ self, not to let him grow too much ‘ acquainted with me, for fear he ^ should presume to offer his Service
* to me, but I think my self a great ‘ deal too good, for such sort of Fellows, ‘ as he, and his Brother are ’. ‘ My ‘ dear Clariana, said Elmira, I am much ‘ oblig’d to you for your timely Infor
* mation, and Shall take more care of ‘ him the next Time: I own I did ‘ give him a little Encouragement, but ^ Since I know this, I shall take more ‘ care for the future’. ‘ 1 went in to ‘ them, and hindered them from saying ^ a bout me, but found by Elmira's ® Looks, that she vas in quite ano
* there Temper, than when I visited her
* the Time before '; if I look’d upon ‘ her with an Air of Love and Respect,

( she would return it, by an Air of f Scorn, and would fay’; ‘ Dear, Sir, I ^ am very sorry, you give your self lb J much Trouble, as to come sofar, to J see me every Day: I intrude upon J your Goodness too much, in inviting you, but i’ll be more careful, ^ how I give you such frequent invitati j ons for the future, because you certainly can’t find Time, to see the J rest of your Acquaintance. I was ^ not so much furpriz’d at this, as if I ^ had been ignorant of the Cause of it, and therefore made her this answer: ‘ Madam, I think itnotrouble to wait on you, when ever you Honour ‘ me with an Invitation, and I am ‘ sorry you stiould think it any; ‘ your Goodness has been very great ‘ hitherto, in giving me those fre ‘ quent Invitations which you seem ‘ now to regret; and I have taken ‘ that Pleasure in accepting them, ‘ which I must needs regret to part ‘ with; but if you think proper that ‘ I Should come Seldom, and desire
L •
It,

‘ it, I acquiesce under your Will and fieasure entirely. Elmira was glad * to hear such a Declaration from me, nd has never invited me above twice since that Time, and then only to drink a Dish of Tea, when other Company was present; But Clariam, on the contrary, follows me ‘ wherever I go; if lam at home all Day, she’s looking out of her Window, drefs’d to the best Advantage; if i go out', file always contrives to follow me; if I 20 to the Piav, She

^ only, because the envious Cla ‘ riana, gave her that Character of me ‘ This is what gives me so much ‘ Uneasiness;; it is in this, that I ‘ want your Advice and Assistance.
‘ D ON Guzman pretended to be ‘ very much afflicted for his brother’s ‘ Misfortune, and reply’d, My dear ‘ Antonio, had I known this before, per ‘ haps I might have prevented a great ‘ deal of it; but as it is, I believe I ‘ can propose something, that may ‘ conduce very much, towards reconciling £/m/va to you; you say its ‘ Clariana that has been the Occafioa ‘ of this Difference; if foi would ‘ have you, by all means. Show her ‘ a little Complacence, or something a ^ little tending to Love, but nothing ‘ that expresses it directly; this will
* make her, in her own Justification, ‘ give you a good Character to Elmira,
* whenever they enter into diseourfe ‘ about you; and, in the mean Time, ‘ you shall give me the two Letters ‘ she has written to you; and intro

‘ duce me into the Acquaintance of ‘ Elmira; by the help of which i’ll ‘ undertake to convince her, that
* Clariand.'s Report of your being a ^ Fortune Hunter, is entirely false; and ^ make it appear plainly, that it is on ‘ ly to gain her own Ends, and in ‘ hopes of winning you over to her ‘ fell, that she has raised that fcanda ‘ lous Aspersion concerning you; then,
* when Elmira has detected Clariana in this, she’ll be more careful, how
‘ stre puts too much Confidence in ‘ what she says, another Time; but ^ in the first Place I would have you ^ write to Clariana these Words, and ^ send them presently

to Clariana.

‘ great haste, wc drop it in the Way, ‘ before we com together: Pardon ^ me, therefore, good Madam, that I ‘ can’t give a positive Answer, to ‘ those dear Lines, that have given ‘ me so much Satisfaction, to think ‘ there is still Hopes of being forgi ‘ ven the Offences that I have been ‘ guilty of, more through inadver tance than Wilfulness.

Don Antomo consider’d often the Conrequences of these Words, and was several Times refolv’d neither to write, nor send them, or to accept of any Propofah his Brother had offer’d him; which his Brother perceiving, told him in a very stern angry manner; ‘ Antomo, what I now propose, I am ‘ sensible would answer the Intent and ^ Effect what you seem to be so defi ‘ rous of, and, if you like what I have ‘daid, I am willing to act my part in ^ it, to the best Advantage; if not, ‘ I neither can, nor will, serve you ‘ any other way, as knowing, that nothing elfe can be so serviceable, as ‘ what I offer’. Don Antonio, like those that are almost drown’d, was willing to catch at any Twig, that he thought wou’d save him, and therefore gladly accepted these Terms, without any farther delay, and tho’ he did not much approve of his brother’s Acquaintance with Elmira, yet, feeing his Brother was determ in d not to assist him, upon any other Condition,
 tjhi, 113
tion, he took Pen, Ink, and Paper, and wrote the Letter to Clariam as his Brother had order’d him, and sentit immediately to her, who when she read it, was so transported, that she could hardly contain herself; but after sometime She wrote him the following Answer.

Don Antonio,
* nr Am very glad to see, you begin ' j to make a right Judgement of ‘ Favours from the Ladies; and could ‘ wish, you were not the infenfibk ‘ Person, I took you for.

D o N Guzman confider’d well the Contents of this Letter, and order’d his Brother to write the following.

Don Guzman was well pleased to see his Plot so Successful in the beginning, and hop’d he was now entering upon that Happiness, he had so long wifh’d for; and diverted himself with thinking, how artfully he had deceiv’d his too credulous Brother;
n the other fide, he would confidefthe Breach of Friendship, and the Base

nefs of the Fact he was going to commit in fb treacherous a manner, against fb good a Brother, and would Reason thus within himseif
‘ Guzman, what art thou doing?
‘ or whether is thy Passion going to ‘ lead thee? Clear up the Mist that is ‘ before thine Eyes, and behold a true ‘ Friend, and a Loving Brother : Don ‘ Antomo! with how much Simplicity ‘ of Mind, Integrity and Sincerity, ‘ did’ft thou disclose thy self to me.? ‘ d id’ll: thou not repose so much Con, ‘ fidcnce in me, as to let me know ‘ the very bottom of thy Soul, and ‘ Showing me the Wound, apply ‘ to me as a Friend, to heal it? Oh! ‘ I can no longer bear to think of ‘ wronging thee; I will confess my ‘ Fault, and serve thee in Reality: * Thou hast always been to me, and ‘ art still, a Friend, a Brother; those ‘ awful Names still keep me back from ‘ my Purposes, and damp my Refolu ‘ tions: But then, art thou not something elfe? Yes, yes; its whifper’d
‘ in
I
  pmijpd, 117
‘ in my Ear thou art a Rival; a Ui' ‘ val I laid I, that Sound Stagnates the
‘ Blood in my Veins, and chills the ‘ Warmth of Friendship; that one ‘ name’s Sufficient to cut in funder the ‘ Sfricteft Bonds of Friendship and ‘ Kindred; no more I regard thee as ‘ a Friend or Brother, but as a Rival, ‘ and as a Rival mufti treat thee; ‘ Adieu all other Ties, when love’s the ‘ Question, I ne’er will lose that Claim. ‘ to keep the others. Besides, did he ‘ difclol'e himself to me till he want ‘ ed my Assistance?? he did not ‘ therefore use me as a Friend, but on ‘ ly thinking I might serve his Purpose, ‘ he told me his Affair, as Clients tell ‘ the Counsellors their Cafe, that they ‘ may plead the better for them, and ‘ with the more Circumspection,
‘ as being acquainted with the Bufi ‘ nefs from the very Bottom; if ‘ foi do but make him a just return;
‘ and again, would any Lawyer ‘ plead a Cause for a Man, when he ‘ himself in the End must suffer by it?
13; No,
ii 'The Bro thers; Or,
‘ No, certainly: Then have I not Reason
‘ on my Side? Reason and Love in ‘ Combination, what can I desire ‘ more? Antonio, I only act upon the ‘ Principles of self prefervation, I still love you as. a Friend and Brother, ‘ and will ever serve you as such, ‘ where the Name of Rival does not ‘ interpose, and oblige me to hate you.
With these, and suchlike Realbns, he soon persuaded himself of his own Innocence, and the Justice of his Cause; and his Love, the Motive upon which lie acted, urg’d him to believe the rest of the World would acquit him in the Same manner. Night came on, and the two Brothers went to clariand.s House, where they found Elmira, who was surpriz’d to see Don Guzman with ■ his Brother, and said to Qlariana, ‘ I *, thought we should have had only ‘ bon Antonio's Company this Even ‘ ihg’; Clariana, to confirm the re fentment Elmira had taken against Don Nnrante, answer’d her thus: ‘ I ‘ ilinpofe, Madam, Don Antomo ima

^ gin’d you would be here, and has ‘ brought his Brother to entertain ‘ you, that be may not be at the ‘ Trouble of talking wdth us both ’; ‘ I thank you for acquainting me ‘ with it, reply’d Elmira, your Rea ‘ fon’s good, and now I Shall know ‘ who to direct my Discourse to, ancf ‘ how to behave my felf’. She had no sooner ended, than Don Guzman coming up to salute her, she receiv’d him with a becoming Modesty, that charm’d him more than before, and confirm’d her Conquest over him : And he soon found by a little Conversation with her, that the Qualifications of her Mind, exceeded her outward Beauty, as much as her Beauty exceeded that of Clariana; as his Brother, Don Entente, was coming up to her, she turn’d Pale, and said scornfully; ‘ Sir, ^ I beg you would not come near me, ‘ I am so III I shall swoon away if ‘ you touch me’. Don guzmanxe joyc’d at this, and triumph’d in his brother’s Misfortunes, thinking to
J 4 make
%
120 B RO T HERS : Or,
make an Advantage of her Resentment by saying ^ I am extremely ‘ sorry, I was so rude as to approach ‘ you without your Permission;; am ‘ so blame beyond all dispute; I beg ‘ your Pardon, and hope, that I was ‘ not the Cause of your Indifpofition’. ‘ Sir, said Elmira, I desire you would ‘ not make your self uneg^fy at my ‘ being a little out of Order, and be ‘ convinc’d by me, that you neither ‘ are, nor I believe would be, guilty ^ of anything like what is the Occasion of my Illnefs’. These were Words of Comfort to Don Guzman, but Don Antonio heard them with a Heart ready to burst: with Grief, for the Reception he had met with; yet hoping the Opinion fhefeem’d to have of his Brother, might make her the more ready to hear him, he made Shift to bear up, under the Load of Care and Sorrow, that lay so heavy upon him. As Sbon as Supper was over, Elmira beg’d leave to go home, which Clariana readily granted, and
Don
T reachery punijhi, 12 T
Don Guzman offer’d his Service to conduct her thither, which She after a faint Refusal accepted.
Clariana was now left alone with Don Antomo, which was what she defir’d, and after having remain’d filent sometime, in Expectation of a formal Declaration of Love from him. She began thus : ‘ Don Antomo, ‘ if all the Gentlemen in Spain are of ‘ your Temper, they must certainly ‘ be a long while in gaining the Af ‘ sections of the young Ladies; sure ‘ they are not all so negligent and di ‘ latory, or is it the Custom of your ‘ Country, for the Ladies to make ‘ their adct*effes to the Men? It must * fois the Gentlemen are all like ^ you, and the Ladies as brisk and ^ airy as they are in France: We French ‘ Ladies, Sir, can no sooner settle our ‘ Affections upon a Gentleman of Me ‘ rit, but we find Ways and Means e ‘ nough to give him a filent Intima ‘ tion of it, which he calls doing him ^ an Honour; and immediately, as
‘ such
/
%
z  ,
* such,, the first: Opportunity of ^ laying Claim to it. Madam, re ‘ piy’d Don Antomo, the Custom of ‘ the Country is a great Matter in ‘ those Affairs, for its quite otherwise
* Spain; a Gentleman there, stall
* sigh out whole Years for the sake of ‘ the Lady he adores, before ste’ll ^ give him the least: Encouragement;
* She makes Trial of his Love every ‘ way stecandevife, before She lets him ^ [ know, that he has any Share in hers. ® This is the way, Madam, in Spain, ‘ which made me a little at a Loss, for
* want of a true Knowledge of the
* French way of Address; but since ‘ you have been so good as to make ^ me acquainted with it, I ought in ‘ Compliance to the Country, to ob ‘ serve all the Manners and Customs
‘ of it’. ‘ I am glad to hear you ac
‘ knowledge your Error, Sir, said ste, and hope you’ll take Care, how you ‘ fall into it again; for tho’ a Crime ‘ thro’ Tnadvertance is excusable, ‘ yet when it’s committed wilfully,

‘ contrary to Law, Custom, and the ‘ Dictates of a Mans own Conscience | ‘ think, it is too great to admit of' | ‘ any Excufe’. ‘ Madam, said Don | ‘ no body is more ready to
‘ mend a Fault than my self, when I ‘ know that it is one, and no body is ‘ more ready to ask Pardon for it He was going to say much more, when Don Guzman came in, who had made a very good use of the Time he ftay’d with Elmira, for feeing from whence her disguft proceeded, as soon as he was sat down, Said, ‘ I beg Pardon, Ma ‘ dam, for being so very pressing to wait ‘ on you Home, but Folks in Love ‘ choose to be left alone, and only hate ‘ the Company that hinders them ‘ from speaking their Thoughts free ‘ ly to each other ’. ‘do you think,
‘ said Elmira, that Don Antomo is real ‘ ly in Love viith darianav ‘ Do I ‘ think it. Madam, reply’d Don ‘ Guzman, Yes, and am positive of it;
‘ but I don’t much wonder at it, for ‘ he has been in Love with half the
‘ Ladies

*' Ladies in Verfallies since he firs: ‘ came hither; tho’ his Love for c/a ‘ riam is much more ardent, than it ‘ usually is; for his common way is, ‘ to be mighty zealous at firsf, and
* presently after leave them, and fly ‘ to a new Object; but tho’ he has ‘ been in Love with Clariana, to my ‘ Knowledge, sometime, yet his Paf ‘ fion is rather increas’d than abated;
* Clariana is still Mistress of his Soul; ‘ he sometimes lies awake whole
* Nights, sighing, and calling upon ‘ rhe Name of Clariana, and if he does ‘ chance to close his Eyes, he is con
* talking of her to himself
* sometimes he’ll say in his Sleep; ‘ happy Man that I am! Clariana ‘ fmil’d today, and vouchsafed to ^ look upon me with an Air of Ten ‘ dernefs: O that Elmira had not been ^ present! how could I have improv’d ‘ that bleited Opportunity, and taken
* Advantage of that sweet complying
* Temper, and good-humour in which ‘ I then saw her I Oh Elmira! cruel
‘ E Imira!

I Elmira! to rob ine of. tiiofe golden Minutes, by a little impertinent Babbling and Nonsense, that I esteem not ‘ worth the hearing \ ‘ Then I fear,
‘ Sir, said Elmira, that he is paid for all ‘ his Unconftancy, in the Person of ‘ Clariana; I hope she’ll make him ‘ feel a little, for the Wrongs he has ‘ done, and the Affronts he has given ‘ to other Ladies, who perhaps have ‘ been indiscreet enough, to put Faith ‘ in what he said to ’em ‘ I believe ‘ she does, Madam, said Don Guzman ‘ he has done one thing, i’m sure he ^ never did in his Life before, and ‘ that is, he has wrote two Letters to ‘ her; which to me that am ac ‘ quainted with his Temper, is a ‘ sufficient Proof how deeply he is ‘ affected, and 1 dare say he tore ten ‘ in Pieces, before he cou’d approve ‘ of one as good Sense enough to ‘ send tohct’: je/m/vdi laugh’d heartily at what Don Guzman told her, and he taking his Leave, call’d upon
Iiis'
iz^ The B R others: Or,
his Brother, 'whence they went home together.
Don Antomo, restless to know Don ijuzmad.s Success, would not let him steep, without asking him, what had pafs’d betwixt him and Elmira, ‘ An ‘ tonio. Said Don Guzman, the Success ‘ I can’t much boast of; but however, ^ I have sofar insinuated my self into ‘ her Favour, that the next Time I ‘ may talk more freely about it, and ‘ till then, I wou’d have you be sure ‘ to continue in your pretended Love ‘ with Clariana: I have dropp’d one ^ of the Letters she sent you, and I * saw Elmira pick it up, what will be ‘ the Event of it, I can’t tell *, so pray ‘ make your self easy, and depend, ‘ that if its possible, I shall make out ‘ Things to your Advantage. ’ This pacify’d Don Antomo for the present, and the next Day Don Guzman repeated his Visit to Elmira, and at Night coming Home, wrote the following Letter to her.

Elmira read the Letter, and was very much furpriz’d to See Don guz marls Name at the Bottom of it; She perus’d it over and over, and often debated within herself, whether She should Answer it; but at last thinking
 jh'd, 119
Ing, that if his Passion was real, it might produce some Strange effect upon him, She, with much Reluctance, wrote the following Lines.
E L M I R A t? Don G u Z M A N.
Dm Guzman,
I HAD not troubl’d you with this Letter, if I had not receiv’d ‘ one from you, that I can’t persuade ‘ my self was defign’d for me; I be ‘ lieve you must have directed it wrong; ‘ if foi here send it back, and caution ‘ you to take more care in Affairs of ‘ this Nature another time.
‘ For my own part, I confess free ‘ ly, that I shall never think of Love ‘ more; I have seen too much of the ‘ Falfbood of Mankind, to entertain ^ a Thought ofit: I once was deceiv’d ‘ by my own Ignorance, and the Bafe ‘ nefs of a perjur’d Villain, that bad ‘ almost robb’d me of my Heart: But if ‘ I suffer another to do it, may EL

‘ Sin C E therefore you have but ^ just begun to Love, stifle the Paf ‘ ston, while it is in its Infancy, and ‘ rest astur’d, that Elmira is conicious ‘ She is not what Don Guzman would ‘ persuade her she is, and therefore ‘ that he may not be deceiv’d in her ‘ at last, she desires him to perfist no ‘ longer in his Ignorance of what she ‘ is, and to be no longer deceiv’d by ‘ outward Appearances, but to act ‘ more according to his known good ^ Sense and exquisite Judgement, than ‘ to forfeit them both in the Choice of
Elmira.
Don Guzman read this with the greatest Confusion imaginable, and took it so much to Heart, that he fell Sick in two or three Days Time; and notwithstanding he had the Advice of the ablest and most skilful Fhyficians in all Ver failles, he grew worse and worse, till at last they gave him over, declaring, that his Distemper proceeded

ed from some Disorder in his Mind, and advising him, by all itieans, if anything troubled him to difclole it, as being the only thing that could be conducive to his Recovery.
Don Guzman then sent his Brother for Elmira immediately, and order’d everybody to go out of the Room; thus being now left alone, he made Shift to get on his nightgown, and rising out of Bed, he went to the Closet, where finding Pen, Ink, and Paper, he wrote the following Lines.
‘ My Antonio, my best Brother, I ‘ have wrong’d you.
‘ My Illness is a just Judgement
* upon me,
‘ Elmira, whatever I told you,
‘ concerning my Brother and Clariana,
* is false; Believe the Words of a ‘ dying Man.
‘ Farewell, thou best of Friends ‘ and Brothers, farewell; and if you ‘ can, forgive me.
‘ Farewell Elmira, it is for you [ that I have abus’d ^ — •

He could write noi more, but dropping the Pen from his Hand, he gave up the Ghost: as he sate in the Chair: his Brother came into the Room pr c fently after, and went to the bed stde, to acquaint him, that Elmira would come; but he not answering, he concluded he was asteep, when going into the Closet to stay a little, for fear he should disturb him, he found him dead, and the Paper before him.
Never was Mali in the Condition of Don Antonio, he walk’d up and down the Room, stamping and raving like a mad Man, and crying out; ‘ Unhappy Antonio I what a Friend ‘ hast thou lost! forgive thee if I ‘ can. Yes, my dear, departed, best ‘ of Mothers, I can forgive thee, and ‘ do forgive thee from my Soul ^ Oh * that I could but see thee alive again, ^ if it were but to surrender all my ^ Views of Elmira, and lee you happy ‘ in the postestion of that Elmira for ‘ whom you dy’d; oh I cruel Elmira! ‘ cruel to me indeed 1 but how much

She fix’d her Eyes upon Don Antomo, and said: ‘ Don ‘ Antonio, you have done me no ‘ Service, but rather a Diskindnefs, ‘ in recovering me from the Icy Arms ^ of Death; which were open to re ‘ ceive me, and bring me again to the ‘ Sight of my dear Alvarez, and his ‘ dear Friend Don Guzman, whom he ■ meets, no doubt, with Joy, and con f demns nie, for the Crimes I have

‘ Madam, reply’d Don Antomo, you ‘ confound me more than ever, for ‘ heaven’s sake unravel these My ‘ fteries, and let me not be kept in ‘ Suspense by such doubtful exprel fions, what is Alvarez, to you? Or ‘ in what can Guzmait accuse you?
‘ Sir, said Elmira, I have betray’d my ‘ self I own, before I was aware, bat ‘ since I have rais’d your Curiosity, I ‘ shall take a more proper Time to ‘ satisfy it than the present, when ® your Brother is in want of some ‘ one to perform the Offices due to ‘ departed Perfons’, She had no sooner said this, but she went away, and Don Antonio called the People of the. House, to acquaint them with bis brother’s Death, and to give Orders for everything necestary for the
Funeral
  pmtjh'd,
Funeral, which was very magnificenti and suitable to a Person of his Quality As the Corpse was carrying to the Grave, attended by several Nobility and Gentry, who were join’d in their Grief by the whole City: A Stranger, who was just then arriv’d, enquir’d of the People who the Person was that was going to be Buried; they told him, it was one Don Guzman, fspamfb young Gentleman, that came in the Beginning of the Summer to that City, with his Brother Don Antomo, who was the Person that rid in the Coach next but one to the Hearse, The Stranger hearing this, followed them, and viewing Don Antomo earnestly, he at last knew the Features of his Face, which were so much alter’d by the Afflictions he had met with since he had parted with him, that he had not known him, but as he was before inforni’d his Name was anto nio. The Stranger was furpriz’d to see him in Versailles, and more to hear that his Brother, Don Guzman, was
K 4 dead;
13 (> Tfc B R o T H E R s : Or,
dead; but judging it not proper to go to see him, as soon as his Brother was buried, he stay’d about a Month in the Place, and then thinking Don Antonies Grief might be something abated, he went to pay him a Visit.
As soon as he Siw him, he embrac’d him tenderly, and could not forbear bursting out into a flood of Tears, which were follow’d by these Words: ‘ Don Antomo, I doubt not I ‘ surprise you by this my Behaviour, ‘ which seems to come from a Pei> ^ fon you never had any Knowledge * of; but you now behold once more ‘ th2it Alvarez you thought Lorenzo ^ had kill’d, who comes to Sympathise ^ with you in your Grief for the Loss ‘ of so dear a Brother to you, and so ‘ dear a Friend to me; but since it ‘ has pleas’d Pmvidencetodepriveus ‘ of so good a Man as Don Guzman, ‘ let us acquiesce under whatever he ‘ has ordain’d, and give me leave to ‘ rejoice, in meeting with the Per i fon I never expected to fet Eyes on

‘ we’ll go to her, for I am as impatient ‘ to know who she is, as you are’.
‘ When ever you pleafe’, reply’d Don Alvarez,, and they both went immediately to Elmira, who wonder’d to see Don Antonio bring a Stranger with him; which he observing, said,
‘ Madam, I had not difturb’d you ‘ with my Company, but you ex ‘ prefs’d your self the other Day so ‘ tenderly, for the loss of Don Alvarez,,
‘ that I don’t doubt, but it will be a ‘ great Pleasure to you, to see him a ‘ gain; here he is, Madam, and is ‘ come to show you, he is Still alive Elmira fwoon’d away directly, but recovering herself quickly, She said to Don Antonio: ‘ Don Antomo, think ‘ you that I do not suffer enough, for ‘ the loss of my dear Alvarez. but do ‘ you come to trifle with me also?? ‘ know he’s dead; the Monster lo f renzo murder’d him: I saw him

I HAD not been above two Days wounded, but the Surgeons that drefs’d me. Said I was in a fair way to recover; which, I suppose, vex’d my Mother to the Heart, to think that her Designs would be frustrated; and in about an hour’s time afterward, there came six Sailors into the Room, who wrapping me up in Blankets, car ry’d me aboard a Ship, that fet Sail ipimediately, whether, I never could fearn.
I WAS six Weeks under the Hands of the Surgeon of the Ship, before he made a Cure of me; but in that T ime being recover’d, I wanted very much to take a
little
A
142 The
little firesh Air, and the next Time the Captain came to see me, I told him, I grew quite weary of being always confin’d to one Place, and defir’d Leave of him to let me walk upon Deck. ‘ Sir, says he, I wont ^ suffer that, because not a Man in the ‘ Ship, except the six that brought you ‘ hither, and the Surgeon, know that ^ yu are aboard; but since you grow ^ weary of this Place, I have another, ‘ far more proper for you, that per ‘ haps you’ll better approve of, for ‘ variety sake He then order’d the same six Sailors to move me to another Place, which he call’d a Cabin, but I efteem’d it rather a Prison.
It was the most filthy Place, that I believe, ever Mortal beheld; it was so dark, I could hardly see my Hands, and what little Light I had, it was only from a Wicket, through which they us’d to give me my Victuals; my Bed was nothing but an old Hammock, with a couple of Blankets, that ferv’d as a Nest for the Vermin, with
which
Von Al V arez continui. 145^
which I was overrun; the Floor was very ill laid, and so near the Bottom of the Ship, that whenever the Sea was a little rougher than ordinary, the Water dash’d in upon me through the hollow Places of it; and this was all the wasting and cleaning it had; from the time I first: went in, to the time I came out, I never was so much as fuffer’d to change my Clothes, or e ven my Linen: My Allowance was only three small Biskets a Day, and those of the coarfesl Sort; and my Drink was only a Pint of Water a Day, which generally Slunk, and I was oblig’d to throw it away, choosing rather to be parch’d with Thirst:, than drink such nasty Liquor.
IN this deplorable melancholy Condition, I had time enough to reflect upon my Misfortunes, and sometimes I wou’d lament, and say, to my self, ‘ Unhappy Alvarez,! how desperate ‘ js thy Cafe I here thou art confin’d, ‘ without any of the Comforts or Northeast ‘ ceftaries of Life, or even a Proba
‘ bility
144 A D V E N T U R E S hj
‘ bility of being ever releas’d from ‘ this Dungeon, wherein thou art im ‘ mur’d; while thy Leonora is oblig’d ‘ to give herself up to the Arms of ‘ Sebafiian, who has contriv’d this, ‘ to move the Obstacle of his Desires ^ has purchas’d this State of Misery for thee, with the Money that ‘ ought to have made thee Happy. ‘ My dear Father, how tightly didst ‘ thou judge of him when but an Infant; how truly didst thou foretell, ‘ that my Mother wou’d not scruple ‘ to wrong me, for the sake of her ^ darling Villain Sebafiian, who tri ‘ umphs in my Calamity: But why
* do I reflect upon them? Why fhou’d ‘ my Mother or Brother be blame ‘ able? Was not I undutiful to her, in ‘ concealing my self from her three ‘ Years together? Yes certainly, and ‘ it’s that has harden’d her Heart a ‘ gainst me : Was I not wrong, in ‘ letting my Brother believe he was
* in the pofteflion of the Estate, when ‘ I was alive to lay Claim to it? Had
‘ he
Don Alvarez Continud. 145
* he never thought I had been dead, ^ he had never been puffed up with
* the hopes of it, and then had not ‘ taken this Revenge upon me, for ‘ the Disappointment he met with, ‘ when he came to know that I was ‘ alive: It is a just Judgement therefore upon me, and I am content pa ‘ tiently to bear it; left by murmur ‘ ing at Providence, I commit a grea ‘ ter Sin, than any I have before been ‘ guilty of: No, Sebafiian, I envy not ‘ your Happiness;; the Estate ‘ and Leonora, while I undergo this ‘ Punishment for deceiving you.
IWA s in these Meditations one Day, when I heard, on a sudden, a great Noise of Guns; and the Ship Shook very much, which made me conclude she was in an Engagement, and presently after, a Ball broke down tfie Sides of my Dungeon, and the Ship began to take in Water. I could hear the Men pump very fast, and cry out loud for Quarter; which was granted them,

and they were taken on board the enemy’s Ship; when our own beginning to fink, I had just: time to pull off my Clothes, and jumping into the Sea, I swam towards the other Ship, and they flung me out a Rope, which I catching hold of, they pull’d me up, and wrapped me in one of the sailor’s, old Jackets, which I was very glad of: The Captain of the velsel wherein I was confin’d. Seeing me deliver’d from my prison, would fain have persuaded the Men to fling me over board, but they refusing, he jump’d into the Sea. himself, and was drowned; five of the six Sailors, that were privy to my Confinement, follow’d their captain’s Example, but the Sixth, not caring to leave this World, Went to the com r mander, and falling down on his Knees, confess’d who 1 was, and how I came to be in that Condition. The Captain immediately order’d him to be
J
bang’d up at the yard arm, and sending for I was carry’d to him,
but

but he feeing I was undrcfs’d, order’d me to be put to Bed in his own cab bin, where 1 lay the whole Voyage after.
As soon as I was put into Bed, the Captain came t(j the Bed fide, and laid, ‘ Don Alvarez,, be not difconlb ‘ late, and think not, that you are ‘ fallen out of the Hands of one Ene ‘ my, into those of another: I affure

‘ and will furnish you with five hun ‘ dred Pounds, which your good Fa ‘ there paid for my Ranfom’. ‘ Sir,
* said I, I confess I want Words to ‘ express the grateful Sense I have ‘ for such Favours, sofar beyond ‘ what I could have expected, but I ‘ must entreat you to accept of those ‘ Thanks, which are sincere, and the ‘ only Acknowledgement I am in a ‘ Capacity to make at present: I can ‘ by no means expect or desire you ‘ Should go out of your Course upon ‘ my Account, but since your Good ‘ nefs has induc’d you to offer such ‘ Terms, let me sail with you to Eng ‘ land, because I have always had a ‘ desire to See it ’. ‘ Don Alvarez,, re ‘ ply’d the Captain, since you have ‘ to id me your Desire to see England, ‘ i’ll take you along with me thither, ^ but don’t care to disturb you any
‘ longer
Don Alvarez Contindd, 149
^ longer now, So i’ll take my Leavei ‘ and wish you a good Repose.
Things were now bravely alter’d, and I fleep’d very well in my new APARTMENT; and the next Day, the Captain and I fell into Discourse, about the Villain that had confin’d me so long in his Ship: He told me his Name was Lopez,, a Pyrate, that had infested those Seas Sometime, plundering every Ship that had fallen in his Way; and that by all Account, I must have been full four Years in my Dungeon, without once feeing the Face of Day, or being refrefh’d by one Breath of fresh Air: 1 then told him my former Misfortunes, and how I came to be reduc’d to the State he found me in; with a great deal more of tfie like Discourse.
W E arriv’d in England about three month’s time, where the Captain carry’d me ashore, and skew’d me several great Curioftties of Art andi Nature; there is, a little way up
L g the
hjo The abventvres of
the great River of Thames, (that empties itself into the Sea every twelve Hours, ^ a large Hospital for antiquated Mariners, and those that have receiv’d any Wound, or Hurt, in the Govern ^ Service; and a little higher, thro’ the finest Bridge I ever saw, stands another, for thole that have lost their Limbs, or are otherwise disabled or antiquated in the Army, The Buildings are far more like Palaces than Hospitals, and I think them Such a noble Instance of their Beneficence and Charity, that Leonid not omit speaking of them, tho’ it relates not to my present Purpose. And here let me give an Account of the People, who I think re the most gay airy People in the World, not excepting the Trench; the Men are bold and hardy. Soon provok’d, and easily reconcil’d, free, generous, astable, and for the generality well-bred; there are several very learned famous Men in all Sciences, and their Universities are a Proof
how

Don Alvarez Confmud. 15 i
how much they are encourag’d. The Women are discreet, modest, and extremely Beautiful, and I believe the whole World besides, produces not such a Number of Female Politicians, as this one Spot of Ground; but to return to my Relation.
After having spent about three Months in England, took my Leave of the Captain, who paid me the five, hundred Pounds, and took a Passage in a little Vessel that fet sail directly for France, where I arriv’d in three Days time: I then bought my self an Horse, and purpos’d to go tosfain directly, but having a desire to Iee Ver failles, I took it in my Way, where I happen’d to arrive, just as your Brother was carrying to the Grave; I ask’d who it was, and they told me it was one Don Guzman, a Sfamfh Gentleman, that came to Verfallies in the beginning of the Summer, with his Brother Don Antomo, who was the Person in such a Coach.'

man and Don Antonio, soon help’d me to difeover who you were, but not caring to wait upon you immediately on your brother’s Death, I have stay’d ever since in this Place; and being no longer able to defer feeing you, I waited upon you this Afternoon; this is the Sum of what has befallen me since my suppos’d Death, and as Don Sebafiian is dead, I have some hopes Leonora will yet consent to accept of me, which will amply reward me for all the Troubles and Sorrows I have ever undergone since I came into the World.

The Monster Lorenzo, had no sooner committed his heinous Act: of Wickedness; but he came, yet reeking with the brother’s Blood, to demand the Sister, as a Reward for what he had done; hut by good Fortune, I had over heard what my Mother Said to him the Day before, and therefore was resolv’d to Suffer anything, rather than Submit to my mother’s Resolution of bestowing me upon him.
When my Mother saw him, he told her it was done, and she, calling me into the Room, said, ‘ Mariana, ^ Don Lorenzo has often ask’d me, to * give him my Consent, tp make him ^ happy ia you: i confess, I have re“ “‘

‘ rather than let so much Wit and ‘ Beauty be lost to the World, by be ‘ ing buried in a Convent.
As soon as I had parted with them, I went to Don faix, and told hinji the whole Affair; and the good old Man could not refrain from Tears, to think, that the Brother lay upon the Point of Peath, and that the Sister was under a Necessity of accepting of the very Person, that had thrown him into that desperate Condition: So giving me stye thousand Crowns, he Said, ‘ Mariana, take this, its all the Money ‘ I have in the House, or you should ‘ have had more; and here is a Bill ‘ of Exchange, which I have drawn ‘ upon a Correspondent in France, for ‘ ten thousand Crowns to be paid you ^ upon Sight: I would advise you

I stay’d
ly 8 The
I stay’d at Cadiz above a Year? before anything extraordinary happen’d; when one Day 1 went to an afsembly, and coming home very late at Night, two Men laid hold of me, and by Force pull’d me into a Chair, bidding me be very easy, for they meant no Harm; I thought it was the best way to do as they defir’d me, for liow can a weak Woman help herself, against the Efforts of two strong Men.
They carry’d me a great Way, and at last setting me down in an open fpadoos Court, they bad me go up that Pair of Stairs, which was directly before me, and turn up a long Gallery, at the the End of which, I should see a large Door, they bad me ring at the Bell, which I did; when immediately a Servant came to the Door, and without asking nie any qijestions^led me into a stately Room, that was illuminated by a great Number of Wax tapers in Gold Sconces; there stood in it a large Bed of Crimson Velvet, embroider’d
with

with Gold; the Room was hung with the same sort of Velvet; and the Chairs were made of Ebony, inlaid with Gold, upon which were Cushions of Blue Velvet, with Silver Fringe round the Borders.
I HAD not stay’d a great while in this Room, before a Lady came to me, whom I knew immediately to be Sophia, Daughter of the Conde de pia zo, and Wife of Don Eraftho, Master of the Horse to his Majesty: She first de fir’d me to sit down, and then setting down by me, said, ‘ Don Machienello,, ® (for that was the Name I had given ‘ myself) be not furpriz’d at this way of ‘ Treatment,! don’t in the least quef ‘ tion, that Such a pretty Gentleman ‘ as you are, have been us’d to these ‘ Sort of Adventures, and can very well ‘ guess at the Meaning and Intention ‘ of them: I have often seen you at ‘ Balls, and Astemblies, with a Pleasure beyond all Expression; you [ Dance so finely, Sing so fweedy, and

I then told her whatever had pafs’d since her Departure from Madrid, in regard to my Mother, my Brothers, and my self: She feem’d beyond iueafure re joyc’d to see me, and exprefs’d herself with a great deal of seeming Delight; offering me her Service, and giving me a Bracelet of Diamonds from her Arm, as a Token of her Love for me; She invited me to come to See her a gain the next Night.
I took my Leave of her, and came the next Night, as she had defir’d; but instead of meeting with Sophia, there were two Men, with their Swords drawn, ready to murder me; I happen’d by good Luck to have a Brace of Pistols in my Pocket, (which I bought one Day, after I had been robb’d of my Watch and Money, for Lear of another sudden Attack,) I took shem

out, and difcharg’d them both upon the two Ruffians, and took to my Heels, without staying to see the e vent; so taking what Money and Jewels I had, I left Cadiz in half an Hours time, leaving behind me the rest of my Clothes, and my Horse: I have since heard, that the Report of the Pistols so alarm’d the Family, that they all came running upstairs, and feeing the Men dead, with drawn Swords in their Hands, they went and inform’d Don Erafiho of it; who coming up, and feeing it to be true, in a Fit. of Jealousy drew his Sword, and stabb’d his Wife to the Heart, notwithstanding all that were present endeavour’d to hinder him from it.
I went strait to Madrid after I had left Cadiz, and changing my Name and Clothes, I called my self Don Pedro; where I was soon informed of the Death of my Mother, and my two Brothers, and Lorenzo's Execution; But being unwilling to declare my self at that Juncture, I continu’d

tinu’d in man’s Habit, and ftay’d there about three Years, without meeting with anything remarkable * but one Day being at Cards with some Gentlemen, I won all their Money, which was about twenty thousand Crowns; upon this they all rose from the Table, and swore, I had cheated them; and the next Morning, as I was at breakfasi, I receiv’d three several Challenges, which I not being able to accept of, I was ob lig’d to leave Madrid; and quitting my man’s Apparel, I re altum’d the woman’s, when calling ttiy self elntl ra; I took a place in the Stagecoach that fet out the next Morning towards France, and arriv’d at Versailles in about three Weeks after, where I have been ever since,
 then embrac’d his Sister again tenderly, and Don Antonio join’d' with them in their Joy for meeting with each other; and after having Spent a few Days in Versailles, they fet out together for Madrid,

Thus Things were brought at last: to a happy Conclusion; and after so much Baseness and  , these faithful Lovers were crown’d with that Bliss, which only those that have known the like, can be Judges of.
But I can’t conclude, without letting you know, that  being now twenty-five Years old, bethought himself of the Key his Father had left him, and digging at the Foot of the Orange tree, as he was directed, he came to a little Door; and opening it, he saw a Pair of Stairs, which he went down, and

Alvarez,
YOU are now, I hope, come to the Years of Discretion, ‘ and have forsaken those little Follies to which Youth may have betray’d ‘ you.
‘ If you go to the farther End of ‘ this Vault, you will see a large ‘ Iron Chief;; Key will open it, * and out of the Money you find ia ‘ it, give my dear Daughter Manana, ‘ an hundred thousand Crowns; what ‘ ever elfe you find there is your ‘ own.
‘ I took this Method of conpealing ‘ the Effects, leasi, I dying when you ‘ were very young, somebody or other might wrong you of it.
‘ Per
ici  , dc
‘persevere in Goodness, and God ‘ bless you. Amen.
Don Alvarez open’d the Chest,
and found in it seven hundred thou
» *
Crowns in Money, and about twice the Value of it in Jewels and Plate; which he generously divided betwixt his Sister and himself.
These Jewels and Money made an Addition, if possible, to their former Happiness; and having spent many Years in the Pleasures and Enjoyments of this Life, they chang’d it for a better, in a good old Age, leaving behind them many Children not unworthy of such Parents.
FINIS.
