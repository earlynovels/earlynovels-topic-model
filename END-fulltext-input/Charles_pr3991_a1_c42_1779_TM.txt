Two days after being well enough to sit up, I thought it became me to make inquiry who it was that I was indebted to for my life; as I thought I could perceive my protector possessed not an abundance, though perhaps a Sufficiency; therefore, we being by ourselves, I thus began. 
“Sir, it is owing to your huma“ “and generosity that I now exist; 
“may I, without offence, crave a “knowledge of the person to whom. 
“I am under Such infinite obliga “tions ?”

“duty; a duty incumbent on every' “man to his fellow-creature; I found “you oppressed; it wou’d have dis “graced the name of man to have “left you: — if you recover I shall “think myself sufficiently repaid.” ’, 
I afterwards made inquiry of the woman where he lives, to find if I could get any information from her, 
who or what he vas— — Sooner had 
I 
I ash’d the question but she burst out: “All [ Lord be good unto me! “he is one of the kindest. Sweetest “young men, as I may Say, that ever “liv’d — why he has the heart of a “prince, and does more good actions“ “all your fine gentry put to“ ““Fray

“Pray, has he any fortune ?” 
“Fortune! no, Lord help him; 
he is an honest man; he’s none of “your jhim jham gentleman, not he — 
“for my part I wish he was a king —. 
“don’t you think he has a kingly y prefence?’’

“No doubt of it — but if he has no

k 
Thompson and sister, miss Harriet Stretton, Sir William Freeman, an intimate friend f Mr. thompfon’s, wdio has been with us two days, and ' your humble Servant. 
The happiness of the noble pair Seems entirely wrapped up in that of their children, who are equally emulous to give them pleasure and Satisfaction — continually contriving amuse ments in wshich their parents can partake; who, when weary, retire and leave us youngsters to enjoy our own pastimes — So that we live a life of per fcdl unanimity — and I almost begin to think myself transplanted to Arcadia. 
D 6 Sir

i 
Sir William Freeman, is one of the 
% 
most amiable men you ever beheld — 
f 
genteefl in his person — remarkably cafy in his deportment — and, by possessing an abundant show of Spirits, reaps all the advantages of his agreeable vivacity — for he is, and justly too, a great favourite of the ladies — he has been intimate in the family a long time — therefore his freedom may be greatly accounted for. 
Miss Stretton is a lovely young lady, both in person and mind, and appears to be deserving of all that rei 

guard which Mr. thompson confesses 
. I 
to have for her — I am of opinion they will Soon be married, as he informed 
me 
C H A R L 1 si 
me they should have been before now, but for Sir Richard, her father, who is a very odd man. 
In what manner can I describe the 
filial, tender, lively Sophia, unless I 
« 
Say with Pope: 
\ 
Bright as the fun, her eyes the gazers sti ike. 
And, like, the fun, they stilne on all alike : 
Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride. Might hide her faults, if faults Jhe has to hide t 
y 
If to her Share some female errors fall. 
Look on her face and you’ll forget ’em all 
Though of rank and fortune, she behaves with ease and affability to all — she pays the same attention to the request: of a peasant, as to that of a 
peer

Sir William and Sophia opened it — they seem formed for each aether —

he lively term’d it, to get rid of a. 
troublesome companion — but I really 
believe it was to make Some amends 
* 
to the young lady who had been un ’ lucky enough to fall to my lot — We did not break up till about three in the morning. — I know not what coulcl be the cause of it, but every time I touched the downy hand of the amiable Sophia, my blood thrilled through all my viens — nor can I yet approach her without a tremulous awe, although she is condefeension’s

wish her to be introduced — She is

young, and perhaps from want of experience might not be able to with 
\ 
the temptation of title and equipage — for should any of the young gentry take a liking to her, as there are numbers visit here, they would not hesitate a moment to accomplish her ruin, nor withhold one allurement that they thought would attradl the notice of a mere country girl, and then to what a life of misery would she be jubjedt to.

One night in the course of conversation Sir William Freeman happened to be mentioned by one of the company, by way of inquiry what was become of him, as he had not been seen in town for Some time. Sir Richard acquainted them he saw him at your house on a visit, where likewisc was your humble Servant. Scandal, as I have been informed, immediately took the lead, and laid many accusations against his character, which, but for his absence, would have shept in eternal oblivion. Lady Fanny Soon found an opportunity to express her disapprobation of Suffering me to remain there with him — the consequence of which I need not acquaint you. 
She 
\ 
94 ^ ^ ^ E s. 
She is extremely polite, and expresses the greatest: regard for me ^ is continually requesting that I would consent to come and live with her but, ah! Sophia, I could rather wish a certain event to happen — am not I forward shuffey?

I have been twice at the play, and am promised 'to go to Ranelagh, the opera, masquerade, and a thousand .places beside — indeed I am taught to expect So much pleasure that thb thoughts of it only is enough to turn the brain of any Simple country girl —. I am Sure it would mine, (that’s as much as to Say Harriet is not quite a 
novice)

novice) had I not experienced the felicity of woodland hall. 
Sir Richard will not Suffer me to

stir abroad unless he is with me, for 
which Lady Fanny treats him very 
humouroushy — but he tells he: that as 
* 
she lias been good enough to 'awaken 
his care he shall deserve the conse cjuehces it he permits it to sheep again; 
she shall not hiive my thanks for disturbing it i’m Sure.

I hope we shall Soon come into the country again, for 1 already long to see you — and then if I am not allowed to come to woodland hall you must

O, NELSON! to what a number of conshidling ideas has your letter been the means of fubjedling me —

aside the veil, I beheld my own weakness 
and my heart readily confessed 
* 
j ustness of your charge. 
Several times have I resolved to take your advice and leave the place, yet ere I have time to put the resolution in force, my heart proves a traitor to its master and refuses to ac quiefee, although at the hazard of my future happiness. 
In vain do I expostulate with myself on the impropriety of my remaining here, and how necessary it is for my peace of mind that I should sty the place, but all to no purpose— — ' 
no Satisfaction do I receive in

staying — the fertile garden, \whoie roseat bowers and fragrant walks gave me Such delight, is no longer pleasing— — do I visit it now but as a Sandtuary where I can, without interruption, indulge my melancholy reveries — Content, who was ever my bosom friend, I fear has forsook her abode and left me to the corroding throes of Despair, 
t 
The pangs of my disappointment (if it is possible to be disappointed of that which I never even had hopes of possessing) will, I can already perceive, prove as poignant and severe 
as ever was experienced by human being,

at least had cause to mourn the loss of 
\ 
fancied joys? — there indeed is the fount from whence most of our troubles Spring! — Fancy, ever busy in forerunning Time, pictures the most pleasing Scenes and happiest days, but

% 
Thus I with rapture have dwelled on the blooming charms of the lovely Sophia, to whom Nature has been luxuriantly bountiful — listened with pleased attention to the music of her voice — and when I left her it has been with the greatest regret.

When I received your letter I was: with her in the garden, where indeed we had Spent best part of our time Since miss Stretton left us — ‘I ever was. 
I 
an admirer of rural walks, and here they may be enjoyed in their most perfect state, as Art and Nature both combine to render all complete. 
\ 
If I but hinted a desire to walk the amiable maid was always ready to accompany me, nor did the family appear to have the least objection to our frequent rambles — and you may be fui|p, when I received so much plea sure by her company, that I let no opportunity ship to attain it — our conversations were always general, and

The garden is very Spacious, and

we generally rambled through the whole — about the centre of which is a little, neat, temporary building, mo ’ defied by my Lord, and furnished with the works of the most celebrated writers— — when nearly fatigued, wc used to retire, and Sometimes, from the entertainment we met with, remain for two or three hours together; 
■9 
this happened to be the cafe whfn your letter came, and they in the house conscious of the frequent length 
F 4 of

of our rambles, dispatched a Servant with it after me. 
As I pcrused it a Sudden tremour Seized me, my whole frame was affected, and it was with much ado I could Support myself — Sophia was greatly alarmed at the visible change in my countenance, which was no way 
furpizing, considering the distance we

You are So well acquainted with the present shattered condition of my fortune, that it would be needless to send you a preamble of the necessity there is for an amendment — and in wshat manner could that be so well the accomplished as by Submitting to the matrimonial noose, 
My flight acquaintaiicc with mrs thompson got me introduced in this family — his Sister being a fine girl and a good fortune I thought it was unnecessary, being compelled to marry,

to look any farther — therefore, i when

« 4 
I suppose there is Some favourite at the bottom, but as yet I am not able 
to 
F 
CHARLES. 149 
to come at the rights of it — however, I can affure him, be who it will, he shall, at least, meet with a very trou bleibme rival. 
Sir William Freeman has been here, and may be the man — if So, you may depend upon it that the extirpation of one of us will be the consequence, for he is a man of gallantry and I am certain will not give up his pretensions to any one. For my part I wish it may be So, as then it will be decided at once and Save me a deal of unnecessary trouble." 
There is a Mr. Trevor here, a good clever young fellow, he is a particular 
H 3 friend 
150 CHARLES 
friend of Mr. thompson’s, and a great favourite with the family, who interest themselves much in his health, 
as he is shiglitly indifposed. — Now were there the least room, I should be fus picious of him, but they are never together, nor in fat do I think him half So particular to her as he is to the rest. — Who, or what he is I cannot find out, nor is it of any consequence to me therefore I shall not trouble myself about the matter. 
Depend nit, George, I shall use my utmost endeavours to bring this 
affair Soon to a conclusion, for I hate

Since my uncle.

To accomplish which I thought it would be most prudent to apply toft 

Lord Woodland, in hopes that his parental authority would prove a pov/ crfulally — not doubting but he would put it in force — in that however I was most curscdly deceived, as you shall hear —

lovely daughter to bless me with her hand — and that the less anxiety she condemned me to while a lover, the greater tenderness and indulgence would she be inti tied to when a wife — to all which he replied : 
“Sir Harry, I have no objeebion to “you or any gentlemen’s addressing “my daughter — but you must get her “consent ere you can have mine —

This was a stroke that I was not in the least prepared ter, as st did not suppose any parent, especially in his 
4 
Sphere of life, would be so condescending to an only daughter — but as I had ever an aversion to viewing things of the wrong side, I made the best of it, and immediately resolved to pursue my attack another way. 
My next effort I found must be to the lady herself, and as it was a kind of a dernier resort, I could perceive it would require the whole shdll and dexterity of my generalship, prudence and circumspedion to be exerted. 
Lest

Lest a too hasty procedure should entirely defeat all my designs, and that, a little time might be well employed in preparing her for the general attack, I resolved to remain contented for a few days, during which space I was in hopes of making some impression in my favour. — Therefore, armed at all points for flattery and dissirnulation, 
I 
I Sought every opportunity to be with her — if she smiled. So did I — if her brow was o’ercast, mine was clouded too — and if a half fuppreffed Sigh stole from her unwary breast, I caught 
the infedlion — but always took care

to do it in Such a manner that she might be led to suppose I did my en

Are you not ashamed to give a

Mr. thompson intends coming to London, and you may depend on it that I shall accompany him. His reasons for taking this journey are to get a determinate answer from Sir Richard Stretton, whether or no he will permit him to have his daughter — nor can he be condemried for such a step, for he informs me stis now upwards of two years Since he first: made application to him, and never from that time has be been able to get him to declare his mind. 
The behaviour of Sophia, my Sophia, Nelson, is all that the heart can wish — delicate without reserve — she attempts not to disguise her Sentiments 
A 
CHARLES.’ 2 f 
ments, but owns the preference she gives me with a frankness peculiar to her disposition. — I can never enjoy her company So freely as I could wish, by reason of Sir Harry Bowler, who came on purpose to carry her off; therefore you may affure yourself he never Suffers us to be alone when in his power to interrupt it. — We are on a very good footing, though rivals, and he often makes use of the saying“ “her and wear her, ” for his part he tells me, until she has been before the man in the black gown, he thinks he has as good a chance of Succeeding as any other — however I should not be So very easy if I was of his opinion. 
As

Not immediately comprehending his meaning, I replied:

In vain did I attempt to express my gratitude, for the moment I began he interrupted me in my acknowledgments, and asked if it was not' for his own credit to Support his daughter’s happiness, and whether I did not think it was a duty incumbent on every man to fulfil his trust; — therefore, if I agreed to those tw©

Was I but fairly rid of him I should still live in hopes, as I have no fuspicion of there being any more lurchers about — I had once an opinion of Sir William Freeman, but have been Silenced on that head — for So credulous are the whole family, from their own natural good intentions, that you may get anything from them without their being the least Suspicious. 
Sophia has several times desired me to desist my addresses, as she never can

I think wilson will prove an excellent engine in this bufiness, and if you can find him out give him di redlions accordingly — he will not be

He has impudence enough to say or Swear j ust what you plcase to Set down, nevertheless the least use we make of him the better — therefore after we have got Trevor charged with committing the robbery, will it 
not be a masterpiece, for me to offer to palliate matters and stop all further proceedings, as I know the Woodland family will be greatly concerned.

Indeed I do not perceive the charge 
of a highwayman will appear any way improbable, for I am entirely at a loss to know how otherwise he makes the appearance he does, when I have been well assured he was no more than a lawyer’s clerk.

Lady SOPHIA THOMPSON. 
Dear Sophia, 
I A M under infinite obligations to you, first for the Sprightly letter, and next for your kind offer of procuring me a companion to Scotland — but ac present must beg leave to decline accepting it, as I am Sure I am too great a coward to attempt going thro’

half you have Set down — What » rackctting piece of work have you 
made of it! — but as I am pretty near your way of thinking there needs at 
present no farther proof of its veracity. 
/ 
When I received your letter I was quite low Spirited, therefore your lively rhapsody could not have come at a more feasonable time. 
All my little Scheme to be Sent into the country is come to nothing; for just as I had began to alarm Sir Richard, this plaguy Sir William Freeman discontinued his familiarity in the family, calling but seldom, and 
then

then behaving very distant — I fancy Lady Fanny and he have had a disagreement, for she does so bounce about — what has been the occasion of it I at cannot present tell. 
ft 
Yet were I not certain there is no room for any such suspicion, I should almost imagine her ladyship was jealous of me, and what leads me into this is, as they were sitting the other day by themselves I chanced to go into the room and as I entered I heard her Say : 
“Aye! I thought she was not to “be Sent into the country for no ‘‘ thing.’’ 
“What

“What do you mean, madarn, *^ returned he, without paying any at

“Mean, Sir! — that though you “may prefer the girl, I’H take care “you shall not reap any advantage “by this pretended journey.”

The discourse went no farther, nor did he take the least trouble to convince her to the contrary, but after paying me some trifling compliment took his leave. 
I was the icss Surprised at this behaviour as I have Seen So many in

He has not been here since,, sh I fuppose he is gone into the country — 
I have asked her two or three timesi what can have become of him, anti she very pettishly answered me, she could not tell. 
You would be furprised at the ass cendancy she has got over Sir Richard — everything she adviscs is sure to be done— — since Sir William freeman’s absenting himself her whole study has been to ingratiate herself,, his favour « i am terribly ap

From this information I found there was no time to be lost, therefore resolved, as 1 could think of nojother means to get into her company, to put on a piece of assurance and wait on her the next morning.

Dear George,

I have been very busy in persuading this family that I am extremely Sorry for Trevor, and under that mash have had an opportunity, now and then, to throw out Some ambiguous hints, and was very near, one time, of going the wrong side the post — for after I had been expatiating on his many good qualities

and if there had not been Something

“Do you really think So, Sir “Harry.?” — returned Mr. thompson. 
“Why, Mr. thompson, I should “be very Sorry to harbour the least “idea to the prejudice of Mr. “Trevor; but you most allow, Sir, “that it is impossible for any per“ “to live upon the air.”

Upon which I pull’d in as I found it would not do to attack him upon the head of necessity — but how the devil he came by it I cannot imagine, for 1 have traced him to where he Served his clerkship, and cannot learn that he ever had any possession, but yet I think Thompson must; be pretty certain, or he never would have so positively asserted it.

how much he has been wrong’d.

I went, as usual, to wait on the ladies, and found.

Fearful that wc might be interrupted I thought it was most advisable to make good use of my time — accordingly, taking her placid hand in mine, with the most Soothing language, and all the eloquence that I was master of, did I whisper out my love; declaring how much I prized her beyond all the women I

had ever Seen — which part of the 
story, upon my Soul, was really true

trembled; but on my Seizing her

« 
Dear Charles, 
I HAVE been most ardently entreated to use my inshuence with you in behalf of Sir William Freeman, and thouah I confess it has almost the appearance of an insult, yet in what manner can I avoid complying with his request! — But as you are truly 
I 5 
1. 
lyg t' H A t tt 
generous, I am sensible of its being: a principle in your nature to forgive' those injuries which any other man would revenge. 
Although I could ever wise to look with an eye of partiality on the errors of my friend, and exert my endeavours to shade his failings, yet, in the present casc, am I entirely at a loss to find an excuse for his invidious attempt — indeed he Seeks not to palliate his fault, but freely owns it, and yields himself wholly to the clemency of his judge — You are that judge, and I have no fear but you will prove a partial one, considering him 
in the light of a friend. 
F rom 
C H A R L E s, 179; 
From a highness of Spirit, indulgence ot youth, and an amazing volatility in his disposition, has he been led on to commit many egregious follies, which, when you can but bring him to Sober resiedlion, he 15 heartily ashamed of, and will leave no method untry’d to make atonement for what he has done. 
’tis almost impossible that Love, that great refiner of the soul! should prove an accessary in destroying the eternal happiness of the desired object— — yet he positively asserts it is Solely from ardour of his passion he has pursued your Sister — Pride, I doubt not, has had her share in offering the 
16 insult, 
f 
I So C H A R L E SJ 
insult, for too often do we find It is in the power of her arrogance to 
triumph over meek cy’d Virtue. 
0 
Conscious of the little favour he 
ought to expect from those he has So 
highly offended, he cannot think of 
pleading for himself, but deputes 
me council in his cause.. as I am 
Sensible of my not being Logician 
enough to prove that there was' no 
crime in what he has committed, I must 
resign the office and Submit it entirely 
to your own candid breasts — If Maria 
can forgive him, you, I know, will

not be behind hand with her, therefore I have only this to say, which perhaps may be of some weight — he 
Solemnly

• I could wish to be a mediator be tween you, as I have a great esteem for both, and am extremely Sorry that his wildness should be the means of destroying that friendship which I thought we all poffelsed — I am too well apprized of the goodness of his heart, to doubt, could your Maria think favourably of him, his proving an affectionate partner and worthy her tenderest regard — his fortune is large and independent, nor has he the approbation of any soul living to study but his own —

yet, think not that I mean by this to forward an alliance where the hearts are not united and their affections, reciprocal — no, rather, was I certain of an indifference on either fide, would I oppose it with treble ardour; notwithstanding, was Such an event to take place I should be extremely rejoiced. 
’tis Some consolation, my dear Charles, to See my friends enjoy that happiness which I am debarred of — Scarce have I left a single gleam of hope that Harriet, my amiable Harriet! ever will be mine — my heart is depressed, all the flattering joys I had formed to experience in our

conjugal hours are vanished, and Doubt, the harbinger of Despair i already become my guest. 
If you can Sparc an hour while you remain in town, contrive to See her, as I then may have Some intelligence — mark every movement, every look, or your going will be of little Service — for there is nought so inquisitive as the distant lover. 
A 
We already begin to think your absence long, and heartily wish for the day that will bring you back — your presence is absolutely necessary to keep us in good-humour — Mr. Sommerville indeed remains in tolerable

lerable Spirits — he is almost incessantly teasing Sophia, who he frequently puts to the blush, for if she appears the least Serious he infills on it her thoughts are with you, and I fancy he is pretty right in his assertions,; or the crimson would not So instantly fly in her face — but as she is certain' the old gentleman means not to offend she takes all in good part.

TO THE 
Hon, JAMES THOMPSON. 
What you request am I at 
liberty to refuse? — You, perhaps. Say — “Aye, when Honour is at “stake : ” — Weil then, granting my newborn Flonour has been offended, have I not as much right to cut a friend’s throat as e’er a Sir Knight in the universe. 
In 
CHARLES. l8y 
In this manner may I write, but you, I shatter myself, are too well 
t 
acquainted with my disposition to suspc<51: me of putting Such an adt, in force — I can affure you my uneasiness was excessive on my Surprising Sir William Freeman in an attempt So unworthy to himself and disgraceful to me — Although I thought myself So highly insulted, I meant not to pursue him for Satisfaction, but int 

tended to leave him to the corroding stings of seff eonvidion. 
Of this resolution did your letter deprive me, and I found myself bound by all the ties of gratitude to 
forgive an offence that the heat of 
youth 
ls8 CHARLES. 
youth alone had been the cause of, and to embrace that return of friendship which was offered me, and by which I was So much honoured — But this was not to be done at once, as your letter informed me I was not the only person concerned — the situation of my maria’s heart was to be consulted ’ere I could attempt to begin the treaty — this required both time and observation, but, however, 
rccolledling that, had it not been for your little device, I should not perhaps, have been So acquainted with sophia’s esteem, therefore I looked on it for certain that to alarm her in a similar manner wmuld be the quickest and Surest way of coming.

at the truth of her Sentiments concerning him. 
ft *■ 
For this purpose, taking a proper opportunity, I introduced Sir william’s name — inquired where 
and how she had became acquainted 
X 
with him, and what was his beha viour at that time — these questions naturally led us to his offering the insult, which on being stightly mentioned I affected an air of indifference, and assured her there was no danger of his ever attempting Such an adl again — She appeared astonished at my manner; and hesitatingly alked me what I meant — Still keeping up 
the appearance I had assumed, I said, 
it 
ipo CHARLES. 
it was no great matter as he was now gone where he must expect to answer for all he had committed here — at that instant the colour forsook her cheek, a paleness o’erspread her face and she sunk lifeless on the chair. 
4 
I was not much Surprised at this change, because I expected there would be Something of the kind, provided Sir William had any interest with her — upon which account I patiently waited for her returning spirits, without applying for any assistance — When she was partly come to herself I inquired what affected her, but could get no answer but that she was taken Suddenly ill — I 
then. 
CHARLES. igi 
then, in a kind of' angry tone, exclaimed against him as the cause, and she immediately burst into a stood of tears — this was too plain to desire any farther proof, and I began 
• J 
to Sooth, and use every argument that I could think of to restore her to her tranquillity again. 
♦ 
When she understood what I had been aiming at, she confessed the Secret palpitations in her breast arid made me a confidant in all its Secret wishes. I wasi far frorn being difpleased at her ready confession of the Situation of her heart, instantly considering it as an indiffoiuble knot to our triple bond of friendship. 
Having

Having Settled thus far with Maria, I waited on Sir v/illiam, who received me with that politeness of which he is competent master — I introduced your letter as the occasion of my Visit, at the lame time desiring we might forget all that which was past, and concern ourselves only with what was to come — to this he 
replied:

“Sir Charles, notwithstanding I “am Sensible of your truly generous

Can she forgive me? — if not, my ■everlasting happiness must atone for the extravagance of my folly. 
“Sir William, my Sister is above casting restections on those things which cannot be recalled — and I “dare be bound you will never *‘ have the least notice taken of “your offence by her.”

Upon which he took me by the hand and protested I had raised him 
f 
to new life : — had rescued him from despair and that he never should be able to make me amends — he was Sure he should be the happiest man living — never, no never should she have cause to complain of his behaviour, but he would submit to be governed by her will — in short I was obliged again to introduce your letter to put an end to his rhapsody. 
This had Some effecst and he began 
to be pretty reasonable — when he, 
came

came to your request for me to visit miss Stretton bcfote I returned, he offered to attend me there, which I gladly accepted, on account of my being an entire stranger to all the family but her — and we fixed ouf visit for tomorrow evening — He told 
o 
me he did not expect; to be received as an over welcome guest, but that Lady Fanny was too much the lady of fashion not to receive us with 
I 
politeness, though, at the Same time, she might wish we had been at the devil, before we had come, there — those are his own words. 
Wc did not part till it was resolved he should call on me at Mr. bartlct’s,

'by which means he might have an

opportunity to pay his compliments to Maria and the family, and it would likewise be a proof that matters were accommodated betwixt us — for 1 look on it as highly necessary, 
when it can be done with convenience, to prevent giving the least room for the busy tongue of dc traduon.

It is necessary to acquaint you,, before I proceed any farther, that we had been informed Sir William was on the point of marriage — hef

This being the cafe, you may be' Sure we were finely conliised at the 
K 5 appear 
202 C H A R L B ss 
appearance of the very man who was the subject of our conversation, and that no way to his advantage — He apologised to her for his intrusion, which he Said he should not have 
been guilty of, but as his friend had cxprcsted a great desire to see miss Stretton,, to know if she had any commands to Wood land hall, he took the liberty to accompany him and, hoped she would pardon his presumption— — paying any attention to his fine Speech,, she gave Sir Charles a very polite reception — but this [no way disconcerted him, who with his usual confidence, took a Scat close by her, and every time she attempted to address hcrself to

Sir Charles, he was Sure to interrupt her — At length, perceiving he appeared to be fully determined to engross the attention of her and Sir Richard, she returned his gay Sallies with that lively Spirit of which she possesses such an abundant share, while Sir Charles and I were left to our own private discourse — the Subject of which, perhaps, if you take some little pains you might be enabled to guess— — is indeed a most agreeable man, and of all I am acquainted with the most deserving my Sophia; yet, notwithstanding all his qualifications I do not perceive he appears a jot the worse for his amazing turn of fortune — may Heaven grant you

In about an hour they left us, and Sir Richard attended them to the door — during his absence Lady Fanny and I remained Silent, and I thought I perceived Something of displeasure hanging on her brow, 
but he took care the moment he came back to put an end to our silence, and began before the door was scarcely shut, with — “Why, Lady

without hesitation, I told him I was

greatly surprised at his having discovered what I had taken So much pains to conceal, but since it was So

This avowed difrcspedl to his parental authority, quite disconcerted the old gentleman, and he remained for Some moments without uttering a Syllable — at length being partly come to himself he declared he would sooner have her married to a ploughman than to Such an impudent rake hell as me — my assurance was beyond

My dear nelson,

IN the name of all the inhabitants of woodland hall do I request you: to come hither — Can you refuse when I assure you it is your presence alone that is wanting to make my happiness complete! — I will accept of na 
excuse for your delay, therefore I

expect you will comply with my request, as I am certain you would not wish to check the delight of your Charles. 
My friend Thompson is likewise in possession of all his heart can wish — Sir Richard' Stretton has gave his consent, and harriet’s love will reward his constancy — This Sudden turn was partly occasioned by Sir William Freeman, we will acquaint you in what manner when you are with us. 
Mr. Thompson when he heard 
p 
that Sir Richard was returned went to pay his compliments to him, and

the old gentleman received him wits more familiarity than he had been accustomed to for sometime — His love prompted him to take advantage of this Seeming good temper, and urge his unabated passion for the amiable Harriet — This he did with fiiccess, for. Sir Richard consented to 
f 
their union in the following whim steal manner : 
“look’ee,, Mr. thompson, al“ 
“I never had any great ob“ “to your having my daugh “ter, yet I should not even now “give you my consent were I not “under Some apprehension that that, “licentious Scoundrel, Sir William, V

“Freeman, will be the ruin of her.. “I have beard you are a very pars' ticular friend of his, if foi hope “you will have no more to Say to “him — for I assure you he had the “impudence to tell me to my face “he would have her in Spite of “me — therefore go home, get the “writings ready — and you may bring “them tomorrow morning, if you “will, with a parson in your hand “and i’ll resign her to you.’^ 
r 
He came home in that fullness of spirits which it may easily be supposed his reception had given him, 
/ 
and acquainted us with all that had happened — this was an addition to 
our

our felicity that we could not have the most distant idea of, and our joy on the occasion was visible in every countenance. 
My Lord Woodland," that everything might be properly fettled, waited on Sir Richard, yesterday, himself, and returned with him and Harriet in his coach — but judge at the old gentleman’s surprise, when the first person he Saw at woodland hall was no other than Sir William Freeman, who had just alighted; he appeared greatly agitated and was for returning home immediately, which he certainly would have done

had not Sophia contrived to get Harriet out of the room. 
ft 
ft 
However, after some little time," my Lord and Mr. Sommerville prevailed on him to be Somewhat pacified, when Sir William asked his pardon for the freedom he had taken and solemnly declared he had no designs on Miss Strettor^, but coni 

sessed to him the Sole rcason for his not contradidting that charge, and as a proof of which he assured them his affections was irremoveably fixed on Maria, and that the being united to her was the extent of his wishes.

This had So good an affect on Sif Richard that he took him by the hand and declared he was an honest fellow after all — and that as what he 
had done was merely out of friendship to Mr. Thompson he freely forgave him. 
ft' 
The three old gentlemen and Lady Woodland then formed themselves into a kind of committee, the resolves of which were that our marriages should all be consummated at the Same time, and we have freely consented to their fixing and ordering; the whole business of the day.

There is a kind of friendly dispute between Mr. Sommerville and Sir 
William Freeman, concerning a por

tion for Maria; the one positively asserting that he will not accept of a single farthing, and the other equally as positive that he shall — but this, as well as everything that may occur, is to be left to the decision of our venerable committee.
