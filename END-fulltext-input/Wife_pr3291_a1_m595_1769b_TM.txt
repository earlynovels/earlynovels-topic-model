Now I, on the contrary, would chuse one, who, being bred in humble obscu rity, is neither accustomed to luxury nor dissipation — one who will be bound to me, not only by the vows of matrimony, but by the more endearing ties of gratitude — one who will have no right to upbraid me, when I would wish to limit her ex pences, that she brought me a large fortune, and therefore thinks she has a right to be as extravagant as she pleases.
— No — give me my amiable country
maid, whose artless gentle heart is above

I met with the most hospitable treat

Sound Mrs. Westbury (the good lady’s name) had, besides these two lovely daughters, a Son in the army. — “My poor boy, ” Said she, when Speaking of him, “is now far distant from his ** native land; but, thank Heaven! his ** return is daily expered. oiil” cou: * tinned she, “he is the Support, the joy,
** of his widow’d mother’s heart.”

“How happy are you, Madam, ” cried I, ‘‘ in such a family! What are riches ‘‘ and grandeur, compared to that air of unaffecied Serenity and content, which appears So visible in every part of it!”
b4 Yes,

‘ Yes, thank Heaven!” resumed she,
“we are indeed content — we have just enough for every necessary purpose of life; more is ncedless.”
A little elegant repast was Served, during which I was still more delighted with my young charmer, who enlivened us all with the Sprightly Sallies of her wit and innocent vivacity.
/
\
The old lady told me her history in
few words: Her husband had been an ossicer of Some rank — his death left her in very moderate circumstances; but that, with economy, and the Supply she received from her Son, enabled them still to live genteely in retirement; tho’ it would not be Sussicient to maintain
them in the beau tnonde.

O Filial affefflon, how amiable art
thou! Never was Samily more firmly united by the endearing bonds of amity and love! And take notice,
Charles, that a good daughter and a. good Sister can never make a bad wife.. No, L am absolutely fix’d in my purposey and. the, more So,, because the lovely
creature discovers a partiality for me, though yet ignorant of my rank and fortune— — Westbury, a fme young man, exceedingly like my Jenny (can I say more in praise of his person?) received.

ceremony with me, farther than good breeding requires. I have had the hap piness to render myself Serviceable to the
old lady; and she has the most gratesul
heart in the world. Her charming daughters regard me in the light of a brother. The eldest is, however, as I could wish, most unreserved in her obliging caresses — as I could wish, I Say; for the sweet embarrasment of the younger in my company (which all her vivacity cannot conceal) fills my breast with the most flattering hopes. I believe indeed my partiality for her is no longer a Secret to any of the family, tho’ I have not yet made any dire^l proposals. I ventured yesterday to vent more freely the Soft effusions of my heart to the dear Jenny, as in a ramble we took after dinner I made shift to draw her aside, from the rest of our party, chatting to her on indifferent Subjeffs — at last, however, she stopped — she looked round with a swqct confusson in her countenance —

Yesterday Saw the commencement of my union with the most lovely of her Sex. Oh! Charles, - with what rapture did I receive the blooming maid from the hands of her brother! — No tears, no re luffance — yet her whole deportment en chantingly, modest and endearing. — Never did she appear So complete an angel — her dress, her ornaments, thouglisim -- pie, inimitably chosen. — Her Sister too, in her virgin white, looked like a modest vestal — her countenance Sedate, and Sweetly feminine. — You are So stow in your motions, Lestey, that I fear your ad dress'there wall come too late — amongst our other guests on this occaston, there was a young man — an exceeding handsome
youth too, let me tell you — who was particularly assiduous to our pretty Sister — nor did she receive those assiduities with an ill grace. I could not judge of her Sentiments by her glances j for I ve

rily believe she never for half a moment looked any man in the face but her brother. — The vifibiy enamoured youth’s, however, were Seldom direisted to any other objeff; but with Such tender re fpecr, as convinced me his esteem was equal to Iiis love.
I took an opportunity particularly to inquire of mrs. Westbury into the state of his affairs; and find he is well born, lut far from being in astluent circumstances. She Says, “He has long discovered,
by his behaviour, a passion for her eldest daughter, though he is “too generous to endeavour to gain her affections; as his Sortune is too Small to permit him to think of marriage, and
Ills Sentiments too just to Suffer him to think of involving the woman he loves ** in his distress.” — She added, “She ** believed the Silence he imposed on “himsels with regard to this Subjest cost
him no Small pain.”
“And

“Then leave the rest to me, ” cried T, forgetting she was still ignorant of my ability to Serve him. — “Ohl Sir, returned she. Sighing, “you have, I trust,
“made one of my children happy; but “the rest must Submit to their fate.”
“And I prophecy, my good friend, ’^' answered I, pressing her hand, “that
I
“that fate will be equally happy.”
I returned to the company wirhoiit explaining myself. My Jenny was Seated at her harpsichord, her brother leaning

I
** Where have you beensaid my charmer, holding out her hand; “you Soon begin to take the husband upon yon — do you already begin to neglect me: ’’
I answered this Sweet reproach by repeatedly pressing the lovely hand to my
lips; then, drawing a chair near her, begged her to proceed with her mussc, and still more to Sooth my delighted Soul with the harmony of her voice.
She Instantly obeyed — will the dear
creature always be So obedient, think ye?

The entertainment was elegantly genteel; but no profusion, no pomp or grandeur. Everything was Suited to the pretended mediocrity of my fortune. My

owti dress was as plain as that of my fair bride.
I will pass flighty over this happiest day of my lise, as unable to give you a just idea of a love and tender iiess to which you have been So little accustomed in your gay world; — mine borders upon enthuflasm. — Till you have Seen my charming bride, I dare not venture to describe my emotions; but her beauty Sufficiently justifies my transports,
nextm.orning, while we were at breakfast, an elegant post coach and four drove up to the gate, attended by three Servants * in new liveries, favours in their hats.
“What can this mean V cried Mrs. Westbury, a little flurried; ‘‘your friends “are very early in their congratula“ “

“What would you give to be mistress

The guests, ” returned I, Snatching her to my breast, “to whom that equi page belongs, are already introduced — **■ it is yours, my love. You generousty “condescended to bestow on me this lovely hand, ” tenderly pressing it bet tween mine, “while only Mr. Warwick; “I hope you will not retraff the gift, “when I add a title to that name, and “Salute 3’'ou as Lady Warwick.”
“What do you mean ?” cried she with Surprise.
“Thar, instead of Mr. Warwick with“ “estate of four hundred a year, you “have married Sir George Warwick
“with, as many tiiousands. Here, my

The whole Samily stood gazing on each other in Silent astonishment.

I had conned over my lesson ‘‘ for the wise of a private Gentleman; but to be a Lady, never once entered my head; and I Sear that at no time

You give young man waring, my rival, three thousand pounds, to draw him into the matrimonial noose; and ril lay my lise, ere three months, are over his head, he would joysully return it with interest could you slip his neck out of the collar again! — Neither example nor precept will ever persuade me in Savour of that indissoluble knot you have.

I repeat it once more,, though I know
I shall rouse your wrathful indignation; the other lister would have been a far more eligible choice for a fellow of your gravity. don’t be angry, George — but you know I must, in season and out of season, Speak my real Sentiments. — You know too a miracle must be wrought ere they become favourable to our fair en fiavers — yet I own them fair, and have a thousand times Submitted to their chains,

stuvery. If their persqn captivated, them mind generally Set me again at liberty.,
Yet don’t be too much discouraged, though you have a little inadvertently parted with yours. — We have, amongst
OUT other modern refinements, found oat a method to make even marriage easy. Divorces and Separate maintenances are the reigning fashion. At this very time there are no less than six of our friends, who are labouring to avail themselves of this happy expedient; and, if I am not much deceived in my Gonjeffures> another happy pair will ere long be added to the list. — don’t mistake me, I don’t mean your worship; I must see your bride ere I can pronounce your doom. — .’tis
your first flame. Lady G -- -- -, and her
old helpmate, of whom I prophecy. — You are revenged, George: — she is as wretched as you could wish; or, if you are of So forgiving a temper as not to wish it, let me Say, as she deserves to be. — He is as jealous,, as obstinate, as self willed, as
the

L 'rho love mischfes at my heart, and who know she still loves you in hers, no
. Sooner heard of your marriage, than I flew to her house, determined to be the first who should punish her with the unwelcome
news. The card parties were formed ere I entered her assembly. She did not pliy. I always meet with a good reception from her — first, because she fears me; and next, because she can have the pleasure of talking to me of a certain Sober fellow, whom she had the honour, ia Spite of nature, to make a fool of.
On my appearance, she immediately disengaged herself from half a dozen cox
0
combs, and, coming up to me with a most gracious Smile, “Where have you “been this age \ I thought Some per verse fair one had at last punished you
“for

you are to know, George, the creature had the vanity to imagine her cruelty had
driven you from the beau mondcy and that you was at that moment carving her name on the bark of a tree. — Do you think I did not humble her? — But you shall hear.
“No, Madam, I took warning by the unhappy fate of my friend, and doubly “armed my breast against the dangerous'

Notwithstanding the ironical air with which I Spoke this, she interpreted it in the sense most agreeable to her vanity. — Well, I really pity him, ” Said she, with a look of importance, accompanied with an undiffembled ssgh; ‘‘ but what could I do! — The creature would love me. — Was I for that reason obliged to return his passion? I acknowledge he “had Some merit; but my heart was no ‘‘ easy conquest. — Poor man! and So he
** is really very miserable! — Well, I could not have believed any of your Sex possessed of So much constancy 1 “But why does he thus bury himself in “the country? — Perhaps Some less ca“ “fair one — and yet, ” added she, after a pause“ “fear common remedies would not do for Such an excels of passion.

I felt not the least pity for the mortification I had caused her; her charms, her blandifiiments, had no effe^i on me.
To do her justice, she is an amazingly fine woman; but a capricious, an inio

YOU give me leave to snppose you
in jest or earnest, just as I think proper. — Then, dear Jenny, be assured
it would in my opinion be much more, proper to advance Such Sentiments in jest than earnest. Since you could prevail on yourself to advance them at all. — You cannot conceive, my lovely and beloved Sister, how uneasy Some parts osyour fine modish letter made your Fanny. — But I ought to have remembered what, an agreeable giddy creature you are. Yes, my dear, osten have you charm’d
me with your Sprightly vivacity._yet,

us down as no more than agreeable tri flers; but few men marry without hopes of Something more than that in the woman they chuse. — Wit and beauty .may captivate and gain admirers; but Solid good sense, sweetness of temper, and a domestic turn, can alone Secure the af
sessions of a husband; and I know, if my Sister would but exert them, she excels as much in these estimable qualities as the former.
Excuse me for presuming to advise you; and excuse me too if I am vain enough to flatter myself it will not, as

Ash'! my dear, how could you, who have Such just. Such noble Sentiments, triste with me in the manner you did! — I was absolutely terrified to death, lest you should actually have taken upon you that to me despicable charaffer, a modern fine lady. — If you now err, after convincing me as you have done that you So perfectly know what is right, what ex

how could you forget it ^ — is he not infinitely dear to all our hearts?
Now, my beloved Sister, in Spite of the freedom with which I have ventured to treat your Sprightly epistle, let me conjure you not to deprive me of your unlimited confidence. — Tell me even your faults and levities; for, believe me, not even your partial Self can be more indulgent to them than your Fanny; tho’, from the diffates of the purest friendship, you must expect my censures in whatever appears to me blameable in

a beau is, for I don’t believe you ever in your life met with a creature of that kind. — r shall have Some difficulty to
give you an idea of it.
In its outward appearanee, it has Some resemblance to a man — but then it is a ' much more showy animal than any you
ever Saw of that species— — has a vast
quantity of hair upon its head, which
%
Seems to stand an end, and gives it the appearance of being frightened, as Some.
sober minded folks likewise think it frightful — that hair is loaded with powder and pomatum, all little enough too, let me tell you, to keep any degree .of life or heat in the few brains that are in Small particles Scattered about in the cavities of that Soft Scull it covers — the head, upon the whole, has more the appearance of a cockatoo than anything 1 can at present recollefi: to liken it to — therest of it chiesty consists of French Silk, gold fringe. Silk stockings, hat, and

it is quite irresistible — white hands, a diamond ring, Snuff box, Scented handkerchief, and cane — its employment is, to present that Snuff box, to wield that
j
cane, to show its white teeth by a perpetual grin, to say soft things in every sense of the word to the ladies, to follow them everywhere like their shadow, and to fetch and carry like their Spaniel — Such, Such, is the description — the life of a beau.
I have half a hundred of these harirt less creatures every day at my toilet % nay, not only at my toilet, but continually at my elbow. At this moment one of them sits toying with my lapdog— —
favountes amongst this gentle tribe are Lord Simper, Jemmy Jeffamy, Billy Sparkle,, and Dicky Blossom. ■ — I shall name no more, nor attempt to charaffer ize them particularly. — Indeed they are

I remember, Soon after I came to town, I went, to Ranelagh with him; a most unprecedented step, as I afterwards. found — cthere was only Lady Betty Percy, a good kind of woman, and an im mense favourite with my Spouse, but of antediluvian manners — two of her daughters, plain damsels as one shall See, but mighty prudent, grave, and all that — I liked them very well, however, till I contraffed more modish acquaintance. —

proceed from lips like my jenny’s.”
At that moment I heard a lady, who stood close at my elbow.

O HARRY, at last my hitherto fruit
less Search is at an end. I have once more Seen the charmer of my heart.
'Oh! how lovely, yet bending, benath a weight of Sorrow! I met with her by chance at that confounded coquet Lady

well as Sir george’s — and yet I verily believe there are no two people on earth for whom she has a more unbounded af seffion — but wild, wilful woman still will have her way — my charmer is an angel,
consequently not included in this censure.
N
I entered carelessly enough — paid her Ladyship a slight compliment — and faced about to my Sister, as 1 imagined; for, as I nightly glanced my eyes round the room, I Saw another female.

Oh! Heavens! what was my transport, my Surprise, when I recognised shy fair

She arose — ssie Sweetly blushed, cast down her bewitching eyes with the most Seducing modesty. — I could hardly restrain myself — I was on the point of claspingher in my arms — but at last prudently
2i6
dently contented myself with her Soft Snowy hand, which I fervently pressed between mine, while I expressed my joy for the unexpeffed meeting.
She made no answer — but withdrew it, and resumed her Seat, visibly agitated.
'I stood gazing on her. I had no power to move, and absolutely forgot there was Such a being in the world as Lady G —, till I heard her exclaim, in a taunting kind of accent, ‘‘ So, miss lous; you “have met with an old acquaintance, I find. I wonder you, who are fond of

“Let me go. Sir, for heaven’s sake;
“you know not the conseqiience of de' ' “me:; but I, alas! too well know my humble station, to stay.”

Her words pierced me to the heart. You must not, shall not go, ” Said I, irj a low voice; “your virtue, your merit,
“gives you a dignity, which all their
wealth and grandeur cannot bestow.”

I am neither one thing nor t’other. — louisa has left me too — ’twas a noble, generous, amiable creature.
Sir George is stately — I very meek, and very Silly — he knows nothing of the colonel’s astair yet. I cannot, I dare not tell him, for the life of me. O, these
lordly men! did I ever think I should stand in awe of Such wretches, or be under Such Subj estion! — This is the precious fruits of matrimony! A pretty;
hand have I made of myself, truly!

The vile Colonel paid me a visit this
morning. He knew I was at home, for
his

his stster had just left me; nor durst I, at any rate, Situated as I am, be denied to him; it would look as if I wanted to shun him, lest he should remind me of my debt.
O that abominable gaming! — Well, in he stuttered, adorned for conquest;
, his address So gentle. So instnuating! I was very cool, very reserved, and very, very stupid.

He then took it into his head that I was ill, and instantly became all Soft and languishing; stghed, fixed his eyes tenderly on me,. entreated me to tell him the cause of my dejection : “Was he not my friend I did he “not glory in that title? was not my

While he was thus pestering me with his tormenting assiduity, and at the very moment he had Seized my hand, which I was struggling to drsengage; who think you my evil genius brought Suddenly upon us, to be witness to this pretty Scene, but Sir George!
I blushed, not from guilt, but Surprise. He gave me a look perfeffly intelligible, bowed ssightly to the disconcerted Colonel, and ssung himself into a chair. You never Saw three more foolish figures than we made. — At any other time, I should have burst out a laughing, but was then in no very laughing humour.

To Sir George from Mrs. Man

WHAT language shall I make use
of, to paint my agony, my distraction, on reading your Satal letter? Ah! my poor lost ruined Jenny! what is become of her? where is she?
O Sir Surely you are deceived. I tould venture my Soul upon her innocence — she could not — it is impossible she should — be the guilty creature you represent her. — I know her heart — she may be thoilghless, giddy, and imprudent — but Surely, Surely, she is virtuous! - — How we doted on the stear creature!

— O, she was the pride, the joy, of her ' widow’d mother’s heart! — What an an^el

Alas! no — there is no' Such
happiness reserved for us. -- -- Heaven
4
knows where the poor wanderer has concealed
herself, where she has found refuge in her adverssty — perhaps you are by • this time able to inform us where we may find her. — For fleaven’s Sake, let us know' if you do, that my husband may hasten to her.

My brother too, I tremble tt the con sequence of his having Seen your letter.
I could not conceal it from my poor, now haff distraffed mother. She was present when I received it. The effeff.it had on me put it out of my power to take the precaution that I could have wished, and you dessred. — I fainted ere I had read it half through; and, when I recovered, found my mother in the Same condition, my Harry almost frantic at the dreadful news — never was there Such a Scene of distress. My mother, wshen restored to
sense and raisery, calling on her beloved child — wringing her hands in unutterable anguish — her lost, her ruined child, her ■ darling Jenny! — She, has been ever ssnce t confined to her bed. The fivock was too Severe for age and an infirm constitution. to Support. — O! I shall lose her too!

You have, I doubt not, heard from him the particulars of our unsortunate meeting aster the play — O fatal ainuse ment! wretched insatuated creature that I was, to be So wedded to folly! — O, that my miserable Sat might be a warning to the thoughtless giddy stutterers of my Sex, who are, as I once did, treading the stowery paths of vice and dissipation! — yes, pleasure becomes a vice, be it in its own nature never So harmless, when So immoderately pursued.
I think I told you that fiend Lady G — was to be of my party. She Sent her carriage for me — she had her motives for this officious politeness — I called for her, and we proceeded to the Scene of my de struffion. — Her brother was there; burr, to my great joy, did not join us.. two ' other ladies, ' her particular friends as they are called, were all our company.

It was a crowded house; the gendemen had made room for the ladies, So that none of them could get near us the whole evening.
Her friends pretended an engagement, and left the house at the end pf the play.
I proposed going home at the Same time, but could not prevail on lady

"Pretty timorous foul!” cried she;
and for what, I wonder — You would
have more cause, were We to attempt “getting out without Some male creature “to attend us. I shall not attempt it, I “do assure you.”
What could I do? At last, her brother
%
joined us; but it was So long ere he did, ' that the company had quite left the house, and the very piazza leading' from the playhouse.
He called loud for her carriage; upon which up came one of her Servants, in a

pretended fright — - ‘‘ An accident has happened, my Lady; in drawing up to the playhouse, a coach drove against
‘‘ your ladyship’s chariot with Such vio lence, that one of the wheels was torn “off. — John, with the ashstance of Some “others, got it dragged to the next “coachmaker’s, but could not get it repaired time enough to fetch your La“ “So I thought it best to get two “chairs, which are here in waiting.”
O, they Will do very well, ” cried she, and immediately stepped into one of them.
The Colonel put me into the other.
“If I had not an indispensable engage“ “” said he, “I would do myself the honour to see you home. If you ** have the least apprehenston, as you “have but one servant between you, I

“to Sollow my sister’s chair to her hoiise,
“and then Some, of her Servants can at“ “you to yours.”
I agreed to this, and ordered the man to go on; he took his leave — but hers had already got to a considerabledistance. — I was a little alarmed at being left So
far behind, and called out to the men to make haste. We were still under the piazzas; and, by their motion, I feared they were in liquor; nor was I deceivedb — I every moment expeffed to be overturned — and, what was still worse, they began to Swear at each other — no doubt, they were properly tutored! At last, they Set me down just at the door of a tavern,
and from words fell to blows

every moment expeffed the glasses to be dashed in my face. I endeavoured, but ill vain, to let them down; they were So
fastened, that all my attempts were fruitless.,
Thus shut up, I redoubled my Icreains.
The tavern door was open. Some of the waiters ran out. I called to them.
Just as they released me from my uncomfortable prison, the Colonel appeared.
“Good Heavens! Lady Warwick, is it you? how comes this I where is roy

hartshorn, which a little recovered me.
I heard a noise of company in the lower rooms — I was ready to die with consu sion, to find myself in Such a place.
You had better retire for a fewmo “ments, ” Said the Colonel, “till you “are a little more coraposedv I will bor “row a cloak and hat for you, if you are afraid to enter again into a chair,.

At that moment a door opened, which terrified me, lest I should be Seen in Such a place; and indeed, hardly knowing what I did, I ran Sorw'ard to avoid the company.
He again Seized my hand; and, as we were at the bottom of a pair of stairs, began to ascend with me — when, ere we had advanced three steps, I saw Sir George coming down.
Not at that moment constdering the consequence of Such a meeting, I Seized his dear hand in a transport of joy, “O,
Sir! how fortunate! I have now in“ “found a proteffor 1’*

How often have you, my kind, my amiable ssster, warned me of my danger, and with well meant zeal condemned my levity and indiscretion! O, had I followed your Salutary advice! — but I was too happy, too exquisttely blessed! — it could not last— — a husband I have lost! — O, torturing ressefiion! — lost by my own playful folly! — a man So very perfect. So gentle. So lovely. So engaging, and to me, his worthless wife. So fondly. So generoussy indulgent!

When cast off by this deluded, and (as he imagined himself) injured husband, where could I sty for protection? Determined from that moment never to. admit a. ray of comfort, I would
not go to you, my too kind sympathising friends, who would, I knew, take Such pains to. administer it. — No, I was re solved to bury myself in Some joyless retirement; but, as I was likewise resolved never to accept of a farthing from Sir George, my plan was not eastly Settled; ILIAD indeed Some jewels, the present of, my worthy, generous godmother; those I could call my own, and I deter mined to dispose of them for my future Support. — The Sum I have received from them; is not inconstderable — ah! it will be Susticient for my few remaining miserable, days 1

day! But, till I could a little Settle my affairs, I came to a resolution of going for a while to my noble, amiable friend louisa, who, by my importunity,. I had prevailed upon, when she left me, to promise she would not remove to So great a distance as to deny me the pleasure of Sometimes paying her a private vistt.
A Servant — a worthy sensiblewoman — who had once lived with her, had a house atkensington; where by my persuasions she consented to take up her abode, at least till she could find a place more convenient, and farther in the country. To this dear creature then. I went, finking under a weight of woe, which I poured out on
her Sympathising bosom, She listened — .and, ah! how sincerely did shel com pashonate my Sufferings! — my too justly merited Sufferings! — It was then the generous, noble minded girl first confessed her pashon for my brother — O that dear
loved
\
ri
loved name! — my tears, my anguish, redouble!
Again I take up my pen — perhaps this is the last time I shall ever wtite to you, my dear Sister. Let me then endeavour to recolle^l: everything! have to Say to« you, ere I bid you an eternal adieu — I know not exacdy what fate intends for me; but too well I know, misery is my portion — Prellihg me to her breast, Let us go, ^’ Said she; let us retire “from this wretched world; and, Sisters “in affliffion, letus be no lessso in friend ship and affeffion — I Swear, ” continued
she, falling on her knees, “while you are wretched, to share your fate. If “happiness should again dawn upon ‘‘‘ you, then will I rejoice at that happi
“ness, and leave you to the possession of “it — but till then I am inseparably united to you. What I have, I owe to ‘‘ your bounty; and here I restore it to

“you — only Suffer me to attend you — •
“nay, I will — yes, I Swear by Heaven,
“nothing shall force me to abandon you.”
I clasped her in my arms. Generous creature!” cried I; yes, we will unite our little Sortunes; our hearts are al ready united, nor will we ever Sepa - “rate. Let us find out Some obscure “retreat; and there let me indulge my unconquerable Sorrow, my endless re
**
Things were Soon prepared for our journey. We had found out an obscure retreat, at the house of a gardener — when, O dreadful, dreadful Scene! — my brother — my beloved brother — I cannot proceed.
He is not in a condition to give any account of this fatal duel; nor dare I aik, nor even question his Servant. I tremble,
lest
%

. lest my distracting doubts should be confirmed
— yet that Surely, that would end my wretched life.
My friend, more inured to misfortunes, and wlio has by that means acquired more fortitude, without my knowledge Sent privately to know what was become of Sir George; but, when her messenger returned, and brought her
word that his house was shut up, and that it was reported he was gone abroad', - she could not conceal her emotion from me. — I insisted on knowing the cause of this new alarm, to quiet my painful apprehension; for ray terrified imagination had represented it as Something, if possible, still more fatal. — Good Heavens! if my husband— — she is at last gone to question the Servant who was present— — am in agonies — O Sister, Sister, what will become of me?

LETTER XXII
From the Colonel to Lady G' —
T AM sasely landed at Calais, and now
lit down to give you Some account of ray affair wdth Westbury; about which the town has, I doubt not, by this time, reported hals a hundred lies.
He is a noble fellow, upon my Soul :
I honour him, for his Spirit and bravery, and am Sorry it was my fate to deprive the world of So promismg a youth; but I feel the less remorse, because he absolutely, by his rash impetuosity, rushed upon his fate, in Spite of my endeavours to Save him.
Ah!
120
#
I
Ah! Sister, what have your Sex to answer for! — Is there any mischief of which they are not Some way or other the cause? — Here am I, a murderer and exile, driven from my native country, by the Seducing destruffive charms of a coy, perverse woman. — Had she been kind indeed — yet perhaps it is better as it is, Since I have one crime the less to answer for — tho’, if to covet my neighbour’s wise be a Sm — Lord help the wicked! — then half the town’s as guilty
as your humble Servant.
%
That I did covet her with my whole Soul, is most certain; and how could I help myself? But I did not stop there — true — I attempted to Seduce her. — Why, if you ladies will So invitingly hang out a stag of truce, and So kindly encourage the enemy’s approach, what would you have us do i — No man ever
made

made a dishonourable attempt, but when " encouraged to it by an improper behaviour.

#
Lady Warwick is virtuous — I have, found her So: — but, by her modish con duff, the odds were ten to one against
\.. i ' ■
her — any man would have betted on the contrary fide.
• #
While fashionable wives take Such pains to display their charms, to please every man but their husoands; wiiile they So continually throw themselves in our \vay, and are to be found every wshere but at home; what can we imai

giue, from Such forward advances, but that they expeff as Sorward advances in return i

You encourage me to hope every T thing from her levity and dissipated turn—

rtible rival. I thought it impossible she should not love the (asshe is allowed to be) finest fellow; in England; though I knew she too ambitioussy aspired to ithe charaffer of a fine lady, not to use all her endeavours to coiaceal it.
»
I made the attempt, assisted too by a •woman’s wit — 1 was unsuccessful, and your last deep laid plot proved abortive. — How the deyil Sir George came to pop upon us So unseasonably, is to me unaccountable,; in a house too where Such Sober fellows as him So Seldom appear! — But why should I lay muchstress ■on his demure gravity? Are we not all
hypocrites Some way or other ^ And he may, for all that, be as great a wag

A Very brotherly kind of a letter, It
must be owned, perfectly free and
easy I,
So, you don’t approve'of my condufi: — and how will you help yourself, honest friend— — tyrants would you,

But for this same Spirit, the want ' of which few ladies nowadays, whatever they might in the Soft Silly age of our grandmothers, have reason to complain, how hard would be the condition of our Sex!

in her air, rush’d into the room,

cried she, clasping his knees, “dearest, ‘‘ best of men, pardon your penitent. Suffering Jenny!”

I arose early this, morning — I hardly
