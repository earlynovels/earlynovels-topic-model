— Young Eustace will make a very good companion in time — allowances must be made fgr his puerile imperfections and frivolities, but a few years will correct all — Why then write to me of the unhappiness of Love? — Love! — Oh, Frederick, beware! — Love is a dangerous rock, on which the most wary and sensible have Split — I know the Sorrows which attend it —

Rev. sir,
IF my letter could So surprise and distress my Guardian, as he writes, how great must be my astonishment and concern upon reading his? — “You know the Sorrows of Love!” — Oh, siraiit postible! or why advise me in Such cold language to forget Alicia? — « You aslc me what She is — may I not justly answer, the same obscure creature as myself? — Sis true — I « told my father was a gentleman, and my mother the daughter of another, but have I ever seen

either? — The name of Layton is entirely unknown, and the fortune, which you mention is, I understand, a gift — not an hereditary postestion'; but what are riches, or the honours derived from the company of lords and earls? — Oh! Sir, I have osten heard you declare, when in the exalted station of a preacher, riches were mere drcss, and titles were but names — I admired the justice of my Guardian s observations, and both in obedience to his words, and respect to his Sacred canonicals, learned to despise Such delusive happiness!

I have difclos'ed the only secret of my heart with candour and Since,, and expected in return your pity or consent— — have no friend but my Guardian, whom I have ever esteemed as a father — You have been to me, from my youth, a faithful counsellor and guide — you have indulged me in every request, * except an explanation of my family — there I am kept in the dark — you have promised me a continuance of your Savours — but now, alas! denied me the only favour that can make me happy. — Why? — miss Mortimer, you Say,

You have intimated that my situation is at present so agreeable there is no occasion for my changing it — I assure you. Sir, that I think it, on the contrary, both precarious and uncomfortable — his lordship is very Seldom at home, and when he is, there is little or no pleasure in his company — he is both Silent and unso
■ B 5 ciable
lo
ciable — and I have oftentimes reason to imagine his taciturnity proceeds from fburnefs of temper; — his Son on the contrary is voluble and unthinking, and instead of mending grows more and more dissipated and irregular. This is a character (my Guardian knows) is very disagreeable to me — butat best there is very little concord between a tutor and pupil, for when I endeavour (as is my duty) to distuade Henry from his folly, I am iggked upgn as a dull senti
menfalisl, that preaches against
>
gaiety, and usurps unwarrantable authgrity. What Solace can I find then in this society?? true his lordship has a fister in law to supervise the house— — Lady Mel ville
>
f
11
ville (who I understand is a peeress in her own right) is so often dejected and melancholy, that I can find but little Satisfaction in her company. It is evident, therefore, that the great as well as low are subject to uneasiness and Sorrow — I confess that Lady Melville is particularly attentive to me, and I am glad that she is So far advanced in years, that the malicious may not misconstrue her kindness, I feel for her ladyship’s dejection, and have often resolved, in the most delicate manner, to inquire the cause, but a punctilious timh dity has always prevented me.
As to the company which Henry introduces, they are so like him
b6 Self,
12
Self, that I can never relish them.. Colonel Prattle, who is constantly with him, I despise— — is a dangerous character — and has attempted more than once to Sow discord between his lordship and, me — he is always boasting of his family, and tea zing everybody with his own affairs. Such men are very improper companions. — I have indicated this to Young Eustace, but my words, instead of being deemed friendly, were evidently treated as officious, for: Henry communicated them immediately to the colonel — he,, poor,, vain, garrulous mortal, both betrayed and exposed his friend — Thus my old remark was verified — no man can keep his
friends
  rj
friend’s secrets that exposes his own. The rest of his visitors are equally vain and reproachable — ' there is only one among them who behaves like a gentleman, and him.
I have remarked to be an occasional friend, perhaps on account of the distance of his residence. mr. Franklin (for that is his name), is extremely polite to me — I was both kindly received and enter
^
tained by him the last and only time I was, at his house, where I had first the ineffable pleasure of feeing and dancing with mis
Mortimer — we have frequently taken a walk together, when he has called upon Henry, which,, as I could easily perceive (though ignorant of the cause) was very
disa
/
• 'r
)
14
difagreeble to my pupil — we have therefore exchanged a promise of cprrefponding with each other.
From this cursory Sketch of his lordships family and friends, my Guardian cannot now fuppose my situation so very agreeable as he before remarked — nor will he, I am sure, condemn my love, especially if he will condescend ta behold the object. — Miss Mortimer, besides her natural charms, is possessed of so much easy elegance and mental accomplishments, that no one can see and not admire — Let not my Guardian imagine it is the down of a Soft hand, or the Sparkling of a blue eye, has engaged my heart — beauty, I am
con

conscious, is a fading flower, and, if not Supported by the great pillars — Virtue and Understanding — grows So familiar to the eye, that,
ere it withers, we neglect it. -- -
Every time I • see my dear Alicia I love her the more — every time I converse with her, I discover new charms, and if it be agreeable to miss Mortimer to give her. hand to him who adores her — what is Frederick that he Should refuse, or be refused so much happiness?? my dear Sir, vouchsafe at least to pity my passion — vouchsafe to see Alicia! — her charms, but above all, her perfections will be sufficient apologies and strong advocates for my love — nay, I flatter my fond heart that they will sofar
prevail

prevail upon my Guardian, that by uniting us himself in holy bonds, he will complete the happiness of his much agitated and affectionate friend.

Sir, if ever you mention her name to me again, or if I discover that you visit her without my knowledge, instead of being my adopted Son, I will even decline to be your Guardian. — Now as you know rhy mind, I hope you will improve upon this advice — think no. more

WHEN by this fond appellation I address you, I may most justly add, the only friend I have — for, oh, Charles! my now unkind Guardian, that has been So long a Sather to me, has prohibited my love, and astured me, if ever again I mention miss Mortimer, he will renounce and despise me for ever! — You are, therefore, the;

Why Should the birth or family of my dear Alicia be an obstacle to my eternal bliss— — is miss Mortimer worse than Frederick— — is Frederick better than miss Mortimer? I am surprised that my Guardian, who is naturally a man of sense, can entertain Such
ridiculous notions — till now he has

Oh! Franklin, as I have now no other friend but thee, whom I can call a friend, or from whom I can expect that Sostering attention which distinguishes an heroic mind, I pray thee advise me for the best - — let me know particularly what Alicia has imparted in confidence to your Sister, and is you think she is willing to be mine in Spite of every obstacle — As we are both the children of chance, who shall dare forbid our banns? miss Mortimer, I understand, has no relation that she regards; and what is Mr. Morton to me that I should be directed

I do not wish to incur the displeasure of Mr. Morton.

No woman.

My dearejl Julia,
I Return you my sincerest thanks for your affectionate letter, but
why not impart to me the urgent business you want me for? I might then be able to comply with my julia’s request, which is at present out of my power — Mrs. Percy being unwilling I Should leave her, especially as there is a stranger in the house — a stranger, Julia, whose character and behaviour have not a little excited my wonder — though I believe he means me well, yet he behaves in such an unaccountable manner, that indeed I wish for

some apology to be absent during his Stay here — his name is Stanford — there is something very austere and imperious in his conduct — he speaks with more candour than ceremony, and oftener abuses then commends. — What Mrs. Percy is to him, I cannot think — but She is all obedience and Submission — and tho’ he frequently Madams her,, and xjoiu have his own way, she never contradicts, nor even attempts to distuade him. last Monday, previous to his coming, Mrs. Percy, while I was present, received a letter, which evidently displeased her — She apprized me of his visit, and forewarned me of his character, but

LETTER VII
To Miss MORTIMER. HAMPSTEAD.
My dear alicia’s favour has exceedingly surprised both my brother and me — the character of Mr. Stanford is both unaccountable and mysterious — the picture has caused many Suggestions — but it is our mutual opinion that he has received it from Mrs. Percy, who has used no doubt Some artifice to obtain it, and may have very interested views in giving it to Mr. stansord — this suspicion is Somewhat corroborated by the old gentleman s apprehensions of Mrs. percy’s coming, and his charge to vol. I. D you
50
you, “don’t let her see it.” — Its very odd that Mrs. Percy stiould not know how long, he might stay, and how often he may come — ^wshat can be her reason for entertaining this strange character? — don’t yuu think, my dear, that She wants you to be married to him — But we hope to provide you a better husband, and therefore advise you, by all means, to leave the house while Mr. Stanford is there — My dear Alicia Shall, never want a home while Julia enjoys one.
The business which I wrote to you about, and for which I So earnestly desired my dear alicia’s company, is another private ball, which my brother intends to give to a few Select friends — no denials 1 nor
\
  fi
nor evasions will be admitted of. — Whatever preparations you may want to make, we insist upon being done at our house— — must beg leave to add, that there Shall be no strangers, if it be possible to prevent it — therefore don’t bring that impolite creature with you— — Mr. Stanford. We hope to provide you a good partner — what think you of the young gentleman you did dance with.i^ — you never mention his name now — but that is no business of mine.

My brother was in town yesterday, and I was wishing much for your company, to render the hours more volatile and agreeable — that horrid wretch, Colonel Prattle, interrupted my solitary moments — I

He Staid a considerable time, amusing me only with a traveller’s account of himself, including all his conquests both in love and war — • the respectability of his family — the distinguished services he has done government, and his great expectations from it — All this, my dear Alicia may easily conceive, was very insipid to me, particularly his abuse of the eustace family, which I don’t believe deserve it — indeed, the Honourable Colonel (as he would fain be fupposed) flatters himself that he is postested of all the tout enfevible of the gentleman of fashion — he prides himself upon understanding Several languages,

 5 LETTER VIII
To Miss FRANKLIN.
THIS morning, when I received your letter, I communicated the contents to Mrs. Percy, and finding then no marks of disapprobation, felt a secret inexpref sible pleasure at the thoughts of being again with my dear Julia, but Mr. Stanford perceiving the Sudden change of my Spirits, inquired the cause — I told him I was going the next day to See a very worthy friend, and stay there a few days.
How, interrupted he — Friend!! ‘‘ friend — Some Secret enemy,

Not being able to bear these cgii temptuous Slurs upon my julia’s character, I Suddenly stepped Mr. Stanferd, by informing him that Mils Franklin waa my friend — a
most sincere friend — and I Should
/
look upon that person to be my greatest enemy that dared to intimate the contrary — I was here interrupted by Mrs. Percy, who enjoined me not to be so violent.
Oh, cried Mr. Stanford, let Miss Mortimer abuse me as much “as She likes — I cgmmend her fcr it — She is taking the part Gf her friend — Miss Franklin — I have heard that name — Well Miss— —
hope
*

I hope you will meet other ” friends there — — ”
Mrs. Percy began to wink — but I could not comprehend her — and, replying to Mr. Stanford, told him I did expect to see other friends, as we were to have a private ball. —
I
The old gentleman’s eyes now rolled in a very angry manner, and aster exclaiming greatly against balls, and those innocent amuse ments, he turned hastily about to Mrs. Percy, and inquired if I was going with her permission?? — •
** Sir, cried thfe good “old lady, I thought the exercise
would be good for her — Dr.
d5 ‘‘hop
5
Hopkins Strongly recommended dancing as the greatest preservation against those sudden pains in ** her stomach, which She has fre quently complained of.”
t
Then Dr. Hopkins Should “go with her and take care of her, ” answered Mr. Stanford, hastily — “Balls! ’ continued he — I hate the name — dancing forsooth! Oh, the Sollies of the age! — I am surprised how any “woman of common delicacy can

i
‘‘ Well, Mr. Stanford, ” cried Mrs. Percy (treading upen my toe) I dare say miss Mortimer has no
‘‘ desire
\
 9
desire to go, especially as you deem it improper.”
To tell the truth, Julia, I did not join in Mrs, percy’s assertion, for I could never utter a declara ration foreign to my heart — However, Mr. stanford’s rage was Somewhat appeased— — confess my spirits were very much sunk — I could not imagine the reason of Mr. stanford’s assuming so much authority in the house — and being disappointed, as I thought, of feeing my dear Julia, was quite out of humour with the old gentleman— —
Mr. Stanford was walking in the garden (for he never goes out but in a carriage) Mrs. Percy took this opportunity of
D 6 bidding
*
6o
bidding me write to my friend, and apologise for not being with her these few days — till Mr. Stanford was gone — I took the liberty again of inquiring what obligations She was under to this Strange many that She was evidently in such: awe of him and why he usurped so rhiich authority in the house, as to thwart my inclinations? -- -- --
My dear, ” replied s|hje old lady, “the intimacy between Mr.
Stanford and my late husband, be“ “Some private reasons, obliges one to be more than commonly polite to him — his character is not unknown to me, and theresore I “endeavour to bear it for reasbns which yod must allow to be commendable— — is a very rich

I did not comprehend Mrs.
Percy, which I candidly acknowledged — “How is, it possible/’ I added, “that a man old enough to be my father, can make me ‘S happy.”

“Stay my dear, time will inform « you — only observe his dispofition,

I would have mentioned the circumstance of the picture, on account of what you have intimated • — but Mr. stanford’s unexpected

Yes, it is evident that Mrs. Percy procured him that picture — but why did he give it to her? except to let her know that he had it in his poflefiion, and how much he esteemed it — Oh Franklin! what would I not give for it — perhaps, by your assistance, I may get it— — it not practicable, think you?

Your favour came, accompani ' ed with another from Miss Mortimer. — a ‘ sure prognostic, I, think of your being united! — I shall make none but neceftary comments upon her letter, having enclosed it for your: fatisshction — You will then be able to judge if I have cause or not for my conjectures
%
Stanford is, in my opinion, taking advantage of those obligations which Mrs. Percy confestes she is under to him — By this means, we till suppose he has procured

alicia’s picture, which we intend to borrow for you, as you have so earnestly requested .- — Whether he is a lover or not, “I ajn weary of “conjecture ” — but it is very extraordinary that he should be so averse to her going to balls, and having gentlemen vilitors. — Indeed, I would not have you, upon any account, appear with Miss Mortimer at Mrs. percy’s; it niay expose the Sair innocent to many disagreeable lectures — There is no time, however, to be lost — if you.aredtill resolved, though contrary to the will of Mr. Morton, to marry her. — The proposal must be made (and it shall be ensorced by Julia) at our house — this, however, is Submitted to your present t consideration; — I think it my duty though to give

74
you this consolation— — being my opinion (as well as my filter s) that Miss Mortimer has a regard for you — she never mentions your name, but with the utmost respect, and though she has never confessed a partiality, her behaviour, we think, betrays it, while her language evinces she has no dislike

On your account, Julia intends to have another ball — it being the only plausible reason we could think of to invite Miss Mortimer. — Till we know what time maybe most convenient to Alicia, it is imposhble for us to fix the day — In hopes, however, to render the time equally convenient to you, we intend— — disagreeable
to us both — to ash young Eustace

and

and his friend — Julia has signified some objections to the colonel’s company, but I thought if colonel Prattle was not invited, Henry might not come, and we of course be disappointed of our frederick’s society— — confess I have no inclination for these balls, and were it not on your account, would decline giving any — the world may think I am tired of my filter, and take this opportunity of introducing her to young gentlemen in hopes of procuring her a husband; but, tho’ I Sincerely wish poor Julia was provided for, 1 scorn to take any sinister means of getting rid of heron her own account I wish her married to some worthy gentleman — for my life, as well as fortune, is. precarious — but I Shall never let the

world think that I hold her up for sale, and that anybody who wills — may have her — on the contrary, no man whose character cannot bear the ftrictelt scrutiny, shall ever have my consent to marry her.
The melancholy of lady Melville is somewhat extraordinary — I believe her brother-in-law, lord Eustace, is far from being a goods

natured man — I know her ladyship is dependent upon him — her deceased father having prevailed upon her to mortgage all his Essex estate to defray his own expenses — she is therefore obliged to bear with the capricious humour of his lordship, which to a woman of her rank and title — but above all, such noble
feelings
\

feelings — mult be exceedingly
mortifying — this partly accounts for her late melancholy. — I think my friend however much honoured in her evident esteem, and it behoves him to attend her ladyship as often as possible; but beware, dear Frederick, of entrusting her with the secrets of your heart — every friend may not see with your franklin’s eyes — though I approve -
of the stncerity of your pashon — lady Melville, no doubt, would censure your choice, and tell you, ^ perhaps, that Miss Mortimer, on account of the obscurity of her parentage, was not worthy a man, whom, for his address and learning, the first of the nobility countenance.

soon as ever your favourite Alicia honours us with her company, our cards of invitation shall be sent out — to you I shall immediately write, and relieve a praiseworthy impatience. — I confess it goes greatly against my will to iilvite the colonel, especially as he bears such a nefarious character — he can speak well of nobody but himself, and beholds the least merit in another

To Colonel PRATTLE, ROYAL standard,
SIR,
a/f'y mind is really so agitated IVJ. J scarcely write — concerning my lifter’s apparent uneasiness I have long had my doubts — these doubts are partly corroborated — Oh! Sir, confirm them entirely, and you will make me your friend for ever. Contrive only to furnish me with the verses, or the picture you allude to, then I shall let my friends see the reason for my late cloudiness and love for
solitude. But, Oh! if my fon —

play the fool, my sorrow is indeed complete! -- -- For heaven’s
sake, my dear Sir! watch every transaction that pastes between him and Miss Franklin, and let me know it. — It is some consolation to think he has a friend to guide him!
Though your remarks of Frederick and my sister are certainly just, yet the date of Lady melville’s malady is of such duration, that my doubts are awhile suspended— — before Mr. Layton was introduced to the house my sister was inclined to this despondency— — be sure she might have been acquainted with Mr. Layton before I knew him — his introduction too, was, I remember, through
her
 05
her — Oh, ©olone 1 again my doubts return! — but your voluntary goodness will I know make every necessary discovery, and relieve, in some degree, the mind of your friend — so agitated at present with grief and doubt I — If what I fear be true, it only remains for me to act as becomes a lord and a man.
The old adage says, one good “turn deserves another” - — as you have been so kind and cbnliderate, I cannot hear of your present exigencies without begging your acceptance of the enclosed bill for a hundred pounds — it may be of service till your expected settlement be granted. I am sorry I mult join with you in condemning
F 5 the

the extravagances of Henry— — only apology in his behalf is youth — I hope, therefore, time will correct those sallies, and render him rnore agreeable, not only
to his parent, but his friends.

When he came, I was reading one of Lord chefter field’s Letters to her ladyship — Lady Melville, I thought, was as, much confused as your friend on. his appearance— — suppose her ladyship was displeased at this interruption

tion — especially as Mr. Morton entered in rather a precipitate manner — our meeting was distantly polite — he inquired if his lordihip was at home — though I was conscious of his being abroad, yet for the lake of retirement, I told him L would inquire— — left her ladyship and him together, and not returning till near twenty minutes had elapsed, prepared myself for this interesting meeting. On. my reentering I thought the conversation between Lady Melville and him was rather warm— — na turasty concluded that Mr. Morton,, who you know is a very blunt man, was chiding her ladyship in a friendly manner for giving way to her despondency— — supposition arose from the reception I met with —
“There, ”

There, ” cried he, ** there is ano there addicted to melancholy — I dare say your ladyship knows the “cause— — is in love poor fellow “— in love with a simple low born wretch — was ever anything so romantic! — what, did not your “ladyship hear it? — I thought he ‘‘ confided in you, being, as I see inseparable companions.”
** No, ” replied Lady Melville, I “affure you I never heard it before « ^pray Mr. Layton is it so ?”
As I thought it might be in some measure conducive to my happiness, knowing her ladyship’s humane disposition, I boldly avowed my passion in the presence of both: — adding, that Lady Melville
herself
 13
herself should witness the object of my love, as I hoped to see her at Mr. Franklin s ball.
Layton, ” returned my guardian sternly— — cannot — must not “go — I shall want you — you must
ktf
“accompany me to Hertfordshire for a few days. It was upon that account I wished to see his lord“
“Sir, ” I returned, con ‘‘ fider duty compells me to go — S must take care of my pupil — ”
Here I found an advocate in Lady Melville — she observed the same, and astured Mr. Morton, that her brother would upon no account let Henry go without roe.
Then, ’*

Then/’ he cried, he must dance with you — let that promise be mutually exchanged and I am satisfied.”
Oh, Charles! — how cruel! — before my guardian and Lady Melville I was obliged to offer my hand, where my heart was not — my sorrow was the more increased by her ladyship’s acceptance of it — and Mr. Morton, I thought, somewhat pacified — the subject of the ball was, immediately dropped.
About a few minutes after miss Mortimers name was repeated, and while Mr. Morton was running down the obscurity of her birth, I was expatiating upon my dear alicia’s merits — this provoked my

‘‘ Yes, ” cried he, I have in“ “— ”
I am surprised— — Mr. Morton, to hear such a vile expreshon from your lips — do you confider who you are, or whom you damn ?”
I thought there was something friendly in the conclusion of her ladyship’s Speech and finding so

'fair an advocate in my behalf, with some fortitude declared that it was evident my guardian was unacquainted with the divinity of my dear Alicia, or such an exclamation, unworthy his character, could never have escaped him — Upon this I retired to the study, in order to meet him as he was going, and show him the picture of my dear girl, which I was unwilling to produce before Lady Melville.
Mr. Morton staid] with her ladyship above an hour— — I dare say I was the chief topic of their conversation!! I was not in the least curious to know it — fortunately neither his lordfiiip nor fon interrupted us — I had the picture now in
my

my hand, and when Mr. Morton was in the hall, slop’d him in the following manner —
Here Sir — this may be fusfi cient to convince you of the beauty of my dear Alicia, and by vouchsafing to See her whenever you please, you may convince yourself of her merit — ”
Mr. Morton made no reply, but taking the picture, put it into his pocket — though I did not intend to give it, yet I thought it better not to refuse it — when I write to Mr. Chapman (as is my intention) to intercede for me, I Shall beg him to get the picture back, and send it to me.

As

As soon as he was gone, I returned to Lady Melville to proceed with the book — her ladyship appeared to me as if she had been weeping. Upon my resuming the volume — she told me not to mind it — she was incapable at present of attending to the reading, which 1 very gladly declined— — trifling conversation ensued— — ladyship not having renewed the late subject, I was unwilling to trouble her with my own affairs — I sympathised with her ladyship’s apparent distress, and hoped wednefday’s entertainments would yield her some relief — but to this she made no reply, only heav’d a farfetched

There was very little satisfaction at dinner — Lord Luftace, I thought, behaved more ftrangly than usual— — eyes were fixed upon his sister and me alternately, and as both of us were exceedingly deprefs’d, I believe his lordship took it in dudgeon — for, after taking only three glasses of wine, he left the table abruptly.
My dear Charles, you must make some apology to Miss Mortimer for me, being thus necessitated to dance with her ladyship — I am resolved, however, as I know lady Melville will never have strength enough to continue long, to be my dear alicia’s partner as soon as possible— — then — I insist upon your dancing with Miss Mortimer

I expect no answer to this, as we shall meet so soon— — then, oh, my dear Charles! urge my fuit to the Sair Alicia with all the energy you are master of — IHAVE' written a few lines, which I intend

ing after her that evening — this is not fair play — if he be really fond qf my old aunt — he has no business with this' young girl — therefore, colonel, I Shall Sorbid the monopoly, and endeavour to disappoint him in that fairer quarter,
I am longing to know the Scheme which you intend to execute — it must be good when it proceeds from a man of your brilliant abilities — is possible I will See you tomorrow — indeed home is become

quite disagreeable — my Sather is strangely altered — Somebody, I dare Say, has filled his head with idle notions — for my part I don’t care — indeed I am determined to be controlled' by nobody, except my friend — and believe me, colonel,

you may command me whenever you please.
Mr. Layton spoke to me about the verses— — pretended not to have seen them — indeed he talked rather strangely about them — perhaps he thinks them of more value than they really are.
As the lady for whom I enter
rain so great a passion, and a
sketch of whose history I have
'0
just learned, is a friend of Miss franklin’s — I think we may take a temporary lodging for them both, and visit each of them occasionally— — they are inseparable friends appearances will be in their favour, and we may indulge our wishes without the least discovery.

I have a stratagem in my head, which I think not only practicable, but likely of succeeding— — we see one another I shall communicate it to you, and, as two heads are better than one, no doubt when we are together, we shall contrive some damnd good scheme that will at once put us in postesiion of our wilhes*^tili then, adieu.

Though I confess I was very much hurt at Mr. stanford’s seeming officiousness, I promised Mrs.
Percy, for the sake of contributing towards her peace of mind, to be filent — and she, poor woman, promised in return to advise me as a mother (which word she laid great stress on) about Mr. Layton.
V
Mr. Stanford now came out of the garden — he looked at me, and though I made him an obsequious courtfey, took no notice of the
compliment, but frowned and walked
io   o r
ed about the room — indeed Julia his behaviour was so odd and disagreeable, I wished myself again with my friends.
Some minutes elapsed in silence— — last Mr. Stanford (vouchsafing to speak) hoped I was well entertained at the ball — I replied in the affirmative, and the old gentleman, with a censorious Smile, thus proceeded.

“Indeed, Sir, it was as I told you, her friend came for her, and would take no denial — besides Sir, “when I heard Lady Melville — a woman of such distinction — was there — I thought it no harm.”

When Mr. Stanford was gone — for his stay was rather stiort — Mrs.
Percy took the opportunity of speaking to me about Mr. layton— — dont know why, but stie heard me praise him with seeming satisfaction, and assured me it was her secret wish to see me well married and provided for.
Though (continued She) it would give me infinite pleasure to See the object of your affec vol. I, I tion

I thought there was something very mysterious in Mrs. percy’s language, especially as I always wiflred to act openly and unreserved— — it being no business of mine to dispute Mrs. percy’s reasons— — thanked her for her good intentions, and the subject was drop’d.

thus preventing your premeditated ruin — but you shall hear — I was there half an hour before six (the appointed hour) a servant (who, I suppose, had been well tutored in this villainy) showed me into the firft floor, where I sat for a few minutes — A carriage now slopping at the door, I looked out of the window, and saw Lady Melville — ^ this appearing so well, I had not the least suspicion— — her lady stiip not coming up flairs, as every moment I expected — I opened the door, and heard a noise between her and the servant, when the latter peremptorily denied her admittance into the house— — this I called out to her ladyship, who, in spite of the servants rude opposition, came up.
** What
/
 97
"What can be the meaning of ** all this, ” I exclaimed ‘‘ is not ** the master of the house at home?’*
“No, ” rejoined her ladyship, and therefore the house is applied to the most infamous of all purposes— — underhand. Madam,
“from a note which I received ** from a Mrs. Percy, that you had ** an appointment to meet me!'
Really, my dear Alicia, I was astonished, and immediately shew’d her the note which I received.
“Good Heaven! is it possible!” she cried “this is young Eustace's ‘‘ contrivance — for I know him ‘‘ capable of counterfeiting my writing — but who can his aecom

plice be that has written that
letter to your friend ?"
Not having received your favour in time, I was ignorant of her lady ship’s meaning — and being apprehensive of danger begged her to come away — but she told me that file was first determined to dive into the plot — conjuring me alsb to be of good courage — as there was a male acquaintance ready at hand to protect us — a friend, continued she, whom I have brought with me on purpose.
Saying this, there was another bustle at the door — Lady Melville without ceremony ran down stairs, and perceived Henry and Mr. lay tonne together.
« What?
* t0
 99
‘‘ What? — my nephew 1” — cried she.
‘‘ Yes” (answered Mr. Layton for him) I am sorry to say it is your nephew, who has been at the ** bottom of this infamy — his cow ardly accomplice — Colonel Prat ** tie — when he saw me fled — but “I have secured this young gen ‘‘ tleman, who villi hope, to make some atonement for his folly — oblige us with a candid “confession.”
Upon this the thoughtless youth burst into a loud laugh, and asked him how he came to think so meanly of him.
K 4 What, ”
200
“What, ” continued he,. “do you look upon me as such a dipionefl man to betray my friend? “no — I know better — I will give ‘• you no satisfaction.”
Ski

‘‘ Villain !” cried Mr. Layton, “which of you endeavoured to “ruin Miss Mortimer?”
Ruin her! — upon my word, Sir, I don’t think the lady would undergo any ruin if I vouchsafed to keep her.”
«
Lady Melville at this instant' ' — fortunately I had a bottle
of hartshorn in my pocket, which Mr. Layton, with the utmost humanity, administered— — in the mean time, seated himself at
the
\
 01
the window, and with an easy air, as if nothing had happened or was going on, began to entertain himself with a book,
I am sure it was above twenty minutes before Lady Melville recovered — soon as she found utterance, she exclaimed, in a most pathetic manner — ‘‘ Oh! what consummate“ “is this — wretch 1” addref ing Henry) ‘‘ was it you that in“ “to ruin this innocent *• maid **

*

I could no longer conceal my indignation, especially when he presumed to intimate, that I was partial to his friend, for instead of ever encouraging his visits (as I told him) I tqbk every opportunity of affronting him,
So— — Mr. Layton — than it was ynw that intended to seduce
Miss Mortimer — ”

I suppose so — interrupted Lady Melville — and the honour able friends were kindly assisting each other — you wrote the note for him to Miss, Franklin, being “better able to counterfeit my writing, and he, I suppose, in return, hath contrived and wrote

your love letter — having a more ‘‘ happy and perfualive style— —
I have no patience, ” cried Mr.
Layton, “villain! — command you, as I am your malter, to fall on your knees to that lady, and “beg her pardon for attempting to ‘‘ do her harm. —
Henry only laughed at this menace, especially as Mr. Layton was Still employed in supporting her ladyship— — his aunt in a Stern manner astured him, that she would positively acquaint his father with the whole matter if he did not immediately comply — this threat had the desired effect, and the poor animal very reluctantly kneeled before me to beg my pardon — though I

I Have ordered John, my servant, if he does not see you, not to leave this letter— — fear your old foolish father may open it — I can

Never fear, Henry, though your plan was good for enticing Miss Mortimer to come to us — we \vill be able, notwithstanding, to contrive another — to be sure it must
be

be done in quite a different manner. — I have a scheme in my head already, which I think with some consideration may answer— — think you of getting an unknown person to dog the young lady some favourable opportunity, and attempt to affront her — we can then run up (as it were) V to her assistance, and make a sham battle of it — while, if Mils Mortimer saints, which ten to one She will, we, her deliverers, can call for a coach, and take her wherever we like. — Really, Henry, this is no bad scheme— — will not only redound to our credit as brave men, but the young lady muff in gratitude be compliant to your wish.

To Colonel PRATTLE.
ALAS! I could no longer support such apparent guilt — my indignation, notwithstanding your friendly advice, would have its vent — especially when I perceived that wretch Layton, with my filter — ^ stnd my foolish fon on his knees to Miss Franklin — but, oh my friend! — my sorrows are now complete — my filter, my unfortunate filter, has left me, and as I ordered Mr. Layton to quit my house— — — perhaps they live together! — Oh, my dear Colonel, hasten to my, relief, and if ptoftible, find Lady Melville, Amazing!

that a woman of her rank, who has been prudent all the days of her youth, should now, when advanced in years, become so criminal — believe me, colonel, that Lady Melville, when young, was the greatest beauty in London — I never knew of any impropriety then — but now — though aged and altered — stie is so foolish as to encourage a base— — • villain. —

However, as I have sent away

Mr. Layton, would her ladyship come home — I think, as the cause of our quarrel is removed, wc might be tranquil again. — Oh! then my dear colonel, endeavour, for my sake, to find her — we may be vol. L L restoreel

You may depend upon my flrictelt Secrecy, though I cannot think your remark is just— — need you care for the calumny of a Sew insignificant individuals — you are afraid, you say, that the people may call you a busy body — no, my dear colonel — they must impute it to pure friendship — but as you have further alleged, that you may incur the eternal displeasure of my sister, as well as my fon — depend upon it, all that you have told me • — or may yet discover, shall be lodged within my faithful breast— —
am confident that Henry entertains a great respect for you — with
this
’
 19 ' ‘
this hope I solace myself— — that if he still retains the friendship of so worthy a man, he may soon reclaim, and get the better of his follies, —
r
I have made several inquiries myself about Lady Melville — but in vain — the servants here told me, that as soon as she had left her nephew at home, she discharged the shaekney coachman — made a bundle of her clothes — burned several ptspers — which, I suppose, were fatal witnesses of her folly, and ordered the servant to call another coach — in which she went, but none of them could tell where. — IHAVE since examined Dureau,

but can find no papers which can lead to a discovery.
Yesterday Mr. Franklin called upon me — but I was denied to him — this morning I met him — he had the presumption, indeed, to Itop me, and was going to give me — what he called an explanation — I liltened to him for awhile, attempting to prove the innocence of Mr. Layton, and his sister— — having mentioned your name, indeed in a very free manner — insinuating, I believe, that you were the cause of this villainy — I immediately stopped him, by aflliring him that I was conscious all that he was telling me
made up artful story, and therefore I would give no further

attention to his words — he would have still proceeded — but I was peremptory, and left him — had I not known that my friend was with me, and that (as you told me) you were such a length of time' looking for me, I dare say, this wretch would have persuaded me, that you were the ruin of my fon and sister— — colonel, colonel, this was one of my unfortunate fon’s companions. — Alas! what infamous company has that blinded youth been so long keeping — but i may impute it all to the negli — gence of his false tutor — to whose guardian I have just imparted a full explanation of the matter — attributing, at the same time, all henry’s follies to his fatal example. — Pray

the hopes of feeing a relation there. I went, an unexpected guest, to interpose, and discover the authors of this dark scheme— — Tequelted Mr. Layton — as I thought the business too great for a woman to undertake alone — to accompany me to the house, and attend in cafe of danger. This

the young gendeman readily consented to, having a penchant for Miss Mortimer, and anxious for her protection — but, behold! — your fon entered — I was very sorry to find that Henry was a chief actor in the play — it was he that had forged my handwriting, and aided his double faced friend— — Prattle — to seduce poor Julia! — then it was the artful vil vain — that Colonel — or that honourable Colonel as he styles himself) fled to you — yes, my lord, and, to defend himself, made false accusations a^ainlt us — buto

this

this treachery — happily we saw a letter, directed for a Mr. Paterson, Windsor, which Mr. Layton took with him, and afterwards, by my perfualion, opened — here is a confirmation of Prattle s deep villainy — there are two brothers of this

name, as we have since discovered, one of them is a tradesman of respectability, and some property in town, who owns the house in Lambeth — the colonel has imposed upon him, and by the fictitious name of Captain Smith — for he is Colonel — Captain — or Major, as he pleases— — not only taken up > several articles, never paid for, but likewise agreed to rent one of his houses in Lambeth, then empty, for himself and family — consisting, he said, of a Coujin Eujiace, and
two

two female relations. — This letter to the other brother, who is resident in Berkshire, was a request that he would provide a country lodging for him, till the house he had taken was sufficiently aired — thus had this master of villainy planned the destruction of two young defenceless girls — but thanks to all feeing Providence, it was timely detected. — Your lordship must certainly be convinced, that this can be no hasty made up story — but if still there are doubts, still a thought that this ill chofen friend is unjustly accused— — shall beg leave to refer your lordship, for further confirmations of this dangerous character, to a Mr. Somers, in Istington — a man who like you, my lord, had welcomed

the viper to his house, till by his treachery and false reports he had lost all that credit, fortune, and happiness, which before his acquaintance with him he had daily experienced. — This information we have since procured, and I dare say, if I were to correspond with your lordship often, I should have fresh stories of his infamy to relate — but I will not presume to trouble you with another fcrawi if this be treated with indifference. — If your lordship does not think proper to recall Mr. Layton, and by his ex

tonne. — I told him the truth — how often you have ferv’d that man according to your own account, and how ill he has requited you — he further inquired if you were with me, when I went to Lambeth, upon our frolic — but according to your directions, I vv^as wife and contradicted all that his lister, it seems, had told him — for I assured him I had not seen you that day, and that Captain Smith, and you were different persons— — this means, my dear fellow — we may meet as often as we please, as my poor weak father has not the least suspicion of your friendship— — then got a lecture as long as my arm — no doubt, he thought me very attentive, but I was thinking of a second scheme— — bid me
Ibllow

follow your example and instruction— — promised, to be sure, strict obedience, though I could not forbear laughing in my sleeve at the old fool. —
I cannot for my life imagine who has been so kind as to put it into his head that I am in love with Mils Franklin — I did not think it amiss to let the fool entertain this notion, that he may not interrupt me with Miss Mortimer ^ — apropos — I walked yesterday to Hampstead, and passst by Mrs. percy’s house— — instead of feeing the young lady at the window as I fondly hoped — behold— — was my aunt — to be sure I was devilifhly surprised— — cannot for my life imagine why she went there— — is
very

very unfortunate, being of course' ' of ever calling upon
Miss Mortimer, for my old officious aunt would no doubt, spoil all our stratagems — however with your assistance, I make no doubt of being able to see her alone. — My father, d believe, does not know where his sister is — and for fear he might add to the number of Jpies thereabouts, I did not think proper to discover— —
have not seen Franklin stnce. — 1 suppose there will be a fine blowup when; we meet — but no matter — I am as brave a pugilist as any

he
THE.   23
he shad ran away, and wished he was able to find him, for the sake
t ^
of a very worthy gentleman (mentioning your name) who had often befriended and astisted him, even to his own prejudice — for, added he, the gentleman not only lent him money upon several occasions, but was refponsible to some of his creditors for large sums— — villain — you now see — is fled — having secretly before his departure endeavoured all in his power to hurt the character of his benefactor. — Perfectly satisfied with this man s Story, I returned without making further inquiries, railing at the malevolence of many existing wretches, and thinking in my own mind show easy it is take away a character — In respect to my fister’s
additional
V
2
additional tale of Smith, my fon has since satisfied me, without knowing the reason of my questions, that you and he are different persons— — Heaven! I am surprised that my sister could be weak enough to entertain such idle notions, and tax me for credulity!
I cannot conceive where Lady Melville is — she has partly removed my former suspicions— — my friend, I cannot suppose that she and Layton are together — besides she hints that this man is in love with a Miss Mortimer — ^how ever, to be satisfied of the truth of this, I intend to make one request to Mr. Laytons Guardian immediately, which if not complied

MY LORD,
Did not Innocence guide my pen, I should not be, able, after such base invectives against my character, to write another word — but, thank Heaven! I am already vindicated in your lordfhip’s eyes, without attempting my own defence! — Yes, my lord, it tvas fortunate indeed that you saw that man at Mr. somers’s door — he knew all that palfed between him and me — I do not wish to. boast — your lordship knows I never
mentioned his name before — but now, as it is mentioned, I asture
you

you that I supported that fellow and his wife for above six months, and lent him money at several periods — Ingratitude has been the return, and Slander my reward! — •
I am glad you afk’d your ion about Captain Smith — I wonder how her ladyship could mistake me for such a wretch — believe me, I have often quarrelled with your fon for keeping his company — but, I dare say, Henry will never see him again— — — Lambeth business has been sot

fortunate as to put an end to that — the reason of the fellow’s flight was the dread of being exposed to you.
Far be it from me to say anything to the prejudice of Lady Melville — I am, therefore, fur

I dare Say there will be Some malicious people Sent to your lord ship to Surther villisy my charaster — but I know the goodness of your heart — and am happy to think their false aspersions will not be credited.

the pleasure of feeing her at the ball. — How She became acquainted with a person of her distinction,, is, I own, Somewhat extraordinary.

I afsure you, my dear Colonel, that my patience is quite exhausted— — may rail as much as you please against your own situation, but, let me tell vou, that mine is equally Solitary and disa agreeable — here have I been, in anxious expectation of Seeing you, ever since two o’clock yesterday — I am most cursedly vexed about the diamonds — if my Sather should find out the imposition, what will become of me? — No doubt he imagines my aunt did Send for

Q
fraud,
%
I leave it to you to bring me off with Lord Lustace about our not being at Hampton court. — I cannot conceive the reason of his going there — perhaps it is to inquire about the diamonds — it is
very

"s
134
\
very lucky, I think, that there is no meeting at present between us,
I have spent the chief part of yesterday and this morning in the Coffeehouse— — you cannot conceive how unfociably and discontented— — aunt is not yet come home — foi think our scheme is likely to succeed still, provided we delay it no longer than today. I perceived some man going into Mrs. percy’s about two o’clock yesterday— — came into the coffeehouse about five, and wrote a couple of letters — I confess that I was very curious to know who he was, having never seen him to my knowledge before — I asked him a few questions— — answered me
briefly
 33'
briefly — I mendoned Miss mortimer’s name, and began to extol her charms, for I did not think it improbable but what this stranger was a rival — however, the contrary soon appeared — he asked me in return if I knew the young lady — my reply was in the affirmative — he then mentioned Franklins name — upon which I pricked up my ears of curiosity, and begged to know if he had seen that family lately? — “This morn“ “’’ cried he, “I came here “upon business with Mrs. Percy, but must return tonight— — may depend upon it, I became very cautious, for though he ash’d me my name, I took care to
t
conceal it, by astuming the title of
Somers
13
Somers (being the first that came into my head) and telling him I stiould be happy m crack a bottle with him any other time.
“Somers, ” ^ echoed he,. “So“ “— I know a person of that
name — perhaps you are a rela “tion of his — he lived sometime “ago at Illington ?”
s
knoy/ing this to be the scoundrel that you rail’d against, I disclaimed all relationship to him — and further observed that I had heard a bad charaster of this person— — which the stranger — now evidently a friend of this mates — exclaimed, that I was very much miscajcen — his only fault, he
said
/ '
137
Slid, was credulity — and he suffered much by being too generous.
“I asture you. Sir, ” added he,
“that my friend has been so weak,
“as to lend his note when he had “not money, for the sake of ac“ “a man who never “deserved it.” — Now I mentioned your name as one in a similar predicament, and who had been deceived in like manner by the same > ^
person— — confess his astonishment surprised me— — told me that he knew you, and smiling, observed“
“you had a happy way of

“turning the tables.” — What did he mean by that— — then pulled out several papers, and absolutely Showed me Some bills: against you which had been Signed by Mr.

Somers, adding that you had been the cause of his ruin, and the foie reason of his leaving Islington— — could not bear to hear him run on in such an insolent manner, and assured him that I knew better — “Would to Heaven, ” I cried, ** that I could see this Mr. Somers, “he should dearly repent his be“ “to Colonel Prattle.’' — Upon which this odd character took out a card with his name, and told me, any Sunday that I wished to meet him, to call at his lodgings in the Middle temple. — He then sealed a couple of letters, and departed — Si little after he was gone, an old gentleman, who had been sitting over a pint of wine by himself in a corner, and listening,
it
 39
- it seems, to our conversation, begged to kxiow what sort of a man the Colonel was that I had named st— — to his request, I gave your description, and added a hint or two of your family.
“Oh! I know hifn well, ” (cried he) — “I know him well — I sup“ “him for above two years — but what was my return? he did not think it sufficient to use my table — my carriage, and servants“ “on all occasions— — he must ‘ ‘ even attempt the virtue of my " wife! a woman, whose character “was never stained, till his malici “ous tongue abused it — who never “deviated from the paths of honour,

I could bear this no longer, and
assured him he was mistaken— —
\
it could not be the same person ■ — he was positive— — I remarked his lady must have given some liberties — else you never
. would have taken any — he would ' have entered into a detail of the business, but I would not listen to. it — indeed he was so very scurrilous, that I was obliged absolutely to demand a truce to the subject— — so exceedingly particular in his observations, that I own I was not. a little surprised.
This Colonel Prattle, ” (cried he,) ‘‘ was once in the Fleet Prison'
'“
 41
where he remained for some“ “— at last, for the Sake of “freedom, he sold his half pay, and “now is so very mean and pitiful, ** that the purchaser is absolutely“ “every half year to grant “him a premium, for the sake of “his making an affidavit of being “alive. — He was sometime after “in Windsor gaol, for a debt con“ “by him and his lady at a “coffeehouse in that neighbour“ “— at the time of his being “taken, he was driving about in a “hired phaeton, which he imposed“ “the people for his own — how“ “I know the person that he had it of, and affure you that he “had neither money nor phaeton returned him yet.”

I see no necessity of courting their consent— — therefore collected, my dear, and let the voice of love prevail.

MY DEAR ALICIA,
You are desired to come here immediately — believe, my dear, we are all in the utmost anxiety about you. — Mr. Layton has seen his Lordship by appointment — they are now upon the most amicable terms; but still Lord Eustace insists that his marriage with you shall take place without delay — • Frederick is equally desirous, as are
t
all his friends — no wonder indeed, when we confider to what danger my dear Alicia is at present exposed— —
.
 73
who can be too cautious against the machinations of that villainous Colonel? Perhaps now, he is devifmg another scheme, and may wheedle the too credulous Henry to perform it. Oh, my friend, you can be nowhere so safe as with us — Mrs. Percy will certainly agree to your coming — I am very sure she is your friend, and advises you for the belt — Who are they that oppose your wishes? — What is Mr. Stanford to you? — It is our general opinion, that he is some old fool that flatters himself with the hopes of postesting your heart — for this reason, he cannot bear the thoughts of your loving another; — but suppose this not to be the cafe — surely, my dear, Mrs. Percy, who has
I 3 been
174
been (as she hints) a mother to you, and with whom you have been from your infancy, has a greater right to sway your inclinations than Mr, Stanford — a stranger— — for Lady Melville, there are private reasons for her objections, which delicacy will not permit her to reveal. — Confider, my dear, that She is entirely dependent on her shrother; and as Lord Eustace has offered Mr, Layton such an annual present, on condition of this marriage, it will be of course so much deducted from her ladyship’s purse— — no doubt Lady Melville ex pests a handsome provision, exclusive of her rights, should his lord ship die before her — a distblution naturally expected every day, as
he
 7^
he is at present in a very ill state of health. — However, as Mr. lay ton’s love and interest are both concerned, you cannot, surely, utter a negative to them — he is determined, if agreeable to his Alicia, to marry her privately tomorrow— — not think the time too soon— — this condition alone depends Mr. manly’s fuit — I am determined, my dear, not to hear another word of love from him, without you are propitious to poor frederick’s hopes.
His Lordship has astured Mr. Layton, that he shall have a hand some estate immediately fettled upon him, provided this wedding takes place tomorrow without any body’s knowledge. — It was, he hinted, the
I 4 supposed.
. *

supposed cause of Lady melville’s objections — though he further declared, that his Sister should be no sufferer by it. — He showed Mr. Layton the colonel’s letters — these have rendered the young lover more anxious about his Alicia, as he knows not what maybe the consequence of delay — he gave him the letter that this villain had sent him, when liberated, against his young and credulous benefactor, begging it to be conveyed as soon as possible to his infatuated Son, and every soft perfualion used for his return — Mr. Manly and Mr. Somers are going with it. ^ Lvery scrutiny will be used to discover this impostor— — gentlemen intend to call upon you in
their
 77
their way — when I hope they will have your permission to conduct you here.
Mr. Somers was told, that Mrs. percy’s husband was a lieutenant of the navy — an account was some years ago brought home of his death — the widow has ever maintained a character of refpe6tibilily. — it is therefore ungenerous to suppose that She could have any sinister views in forwarding this bull nefs.

LETTER LVI
To LORD EUSTACE.
MY LORD,
isa^./ your son this morning, and imparted to him the contents of the letter which you requested of Mr. Layton to be conveyed to him — he feem’d very much affected at the discovery, and rail’d bitterly against the colonel’s treachery — as Mr.layton had previously inltructed me, I then solicited the young gentleman, in as presting a manner as ^ postible, to return home — assuring him, he would meet with the Same

Eufface feem’d fixed to the place he was in, declaring there was a young lady rehdent in that town, whom he had Very much insulted— — now saw the guilt of his villainous purposes, and would upon no account quit Hampstead, till he had made her proper reparation — from this I underhand his design is to marry her — it was not my buhnefs, my lord, to mention Mr. Layton's attachment to this lady — to avoid an explanation of which, indeed, (not knowing the evil consequences that might ensue) I thought it better Mr. Layton should not accompany us — behdes a strangers per fuahon might have more weight than Mr. Layton s; whom, I am very well assured, your fon, through
shame.

shame, wishes to avoid. — I do not ^ think it amiss, however, that Mr. Eufface should stay here till Mils Mortimer is married — the young lady has left Hampstead early this morning, which your fon does not know — if your lordship thinks proper, I will see him again; and urge whatever you wish me to say — I must beg leave to observe, that Mr. Eufface is very inconsolable and unhappy — an apparent proof, I think, that he repents heartily of his late credulity. — I shall be the remainder of this day at Mr. franklin’s — as, agreeable to your lord ship’s wish, the marriage is intended to be celebrated immediately, provided no unseasonable visit from Mr. Morton, interrupts the ceremony

money.' — Indeed my happiness depends upon it too — for if Mr. layton’s guardian, by further solicitations and promises, induces Miss Franklin and his ward to accept each others hands— — my hopes are eternally crushed — forgive me, my lord, for troubling you with any useless complaints of my own — but as we are mutually concerned in this business, I take the liberty of saying, that as my love for Miss Franklin has been sudden, and but lately avowed — I know not how soon Mr. morton’s inducements may succeed with that family, and if Mr. Layton should be married to Miss Franklin, your lordship’s fon will, no doubt, prevail

To Mrs. PERCY.
My dear madam, I take the earliest opportunity, according to your request, of informing you, that this morning Mr. Layton and I were married — but alas! I know not why — sudden emotions seize my soul, and palpitations continually are beating in my heart.
After the ceremony, Julia and I went an airing in the carriage, as Mr. Layton willed to see his Lordship before dinner, and it was thought the exercise would relieve my present uneasiness— — our

return we had been told that Lord Eufface was then seeking Mr. layton— — Franklin assured him the ceremony was performed, which gave his lordship inhnite satisfaction— — then said he would Stay to see Mr. Manly, as he had received a letter from that gentleman about his fon. — It happened now (as I am told) that the picture which Mr. Stanford gave me, lay upon the table — his lordship was seized with unaccountable emotions when he saw it — Mr. Franklin told him it was mine — his lordship doubted the assertion— — he knew the picture, he said, by the peculiarity of the painting, and that it was once his. My entrance, however, interrupted this controversy— — being introduced,
 89
troduced, his lordship flared — and exclaiming ‘‘ Good God, what a wonderful likeness 1” made an apology, and left the room.
Believe me, madam, the impref sion which his lordship’s behaviour has made upon me cannot be described— — am not inclined to superstition— — there is something hanging over me which very much depresses my spirits.
My amiable husband endeavoured all in his power to remove my fears — the company wished to contribute to my happiness— — still there was a cloud over my head, which would not permit the rays of festivity to shine.

A mistake now diverted our thoughts: — It seems there had been a porter, who called Several times last night and this morning, requesting to see a Mr. James Manly — though repeatedly told there was no such person in the house, yet the fellow became absolutely troublesome— — Mr. Manly went downstairs to him, and said his name was William Manly, and perhaps, through mistake, the meltage was intended for him — but the man declared no — he must see James Manly, Esq— — the gentleman who had sent him was so particular, he said, in respect to the Christian name, that he was dehred to give it to nobody 'elfe but James Manly, — Miss Franklin now recollected
that
»
 91
that we had made use of that name by accident, before Mr. Morton— — the porter being very particular in respect to his directions, would not leave the letter — he said he came from jack’s coffee house— — Layton and Mr. Manly, therefore determined, after dinner, to go there. —
I was exceedingly anxious for frederick’s return — it was a long time — yet after all, their journey did not avail — though it was plain by the waiter’s account, that Mr. Morton slept lait night, and was there a conhderable time — but his patience being exhausted on account of the porter’s delay, and his own mistake, that he left the coffee
house

house a short time before the gentlemen arrived. —
In respect to Mr. Stanford, my dear madam — I leave it to yourself to manage matters, and make my apology for not being at home. — Till Frederick pleases to avow our marriage, I think you liad better observe strict secrecy— — which reason I still retain the name of

Alas I my friend, the dreadful discovery has happened — but the conclusion is so contrary to our expectations, that there is little cause for repentance. — I did all in my power to prevent this marriage,. but it seemed to be the decree of Heaven, and who could oppose it?

Layton, flattering myself that I could at least postpone his intentions, by letting him think he was so lowly born, (which I knew would hurt his pride) that he would doubtless subject himself to the future upbraidings of a lady who, I knew, was far above him. — I was well; convinced of the effet of this hidden discovery, and dare say, if I had made it in time, the affair would have at once terminated; — but the thought occurred when too late. —
My friend is already informed of Mr. layton’s marriage, having, as he since told me, wrote to you, and imparted the whole account of this secret wedding.

Lady Melville, who was filled with the most painful apprehensions, even in spite of her brother’s solicitations to ftayyt home — was determined to go to Mrs. percy’s, and see, if possible, Alicia but I believe, Miss Mortimer had been apprized of the bulinefs — for when her ladyship appeared — the poor p’irl ran to meet her — fell at her

Mil's Mordmer could hardly believe her ears — but when her ladyship had assured her that she was indeed her daughter, and that the cause of So long concealing her marriage with Mr. Stanford (as she then called me) was for fear her brother would be incensed against her, and the particular clause in her father’s will of. course enforced — she prostrated herself at her poor mother’s feet, and remained there insensible, till Frederick entered, and, alarmed at her htuation, took her up.
