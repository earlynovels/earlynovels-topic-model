“At the great house! ” replied Mrs. Selby: “that cannot be, Surely; “for it is quite out of repair, and has “not had anything done to it Since Sir “Charles died.”

“What do you want to Say to me, “my dear ?” Said Mr. Selby, as he entered the room. 
‘ Why, Molly tells me that Sir

Said miss Selby : “we have lived long

the longer we live by ourselves, the better we shall be: there is very little good to be OC by mixing with other people.”, :

“Polly, Polly, ” replied he, hastily, you would not get much by that.: 
the less you know of the worldychild,

“the better: it is by tro means a place “for the improvement of young peo pie: you live here quite out of the “way of temptatioir, and therefore “may be both good and happy, if you “will: but were you to go into the world, you would find it very difficult 
to preserve .that integrity of

“London: to be Sure, as thy have “lived there So long, they can tell me about the fashions, and everything.” 
Mrs. Selby Smiled at her daughter’s cagerness: she felt no Small Satisfadlion sherself at the very idea of visiting a baronet’s Lady. Mr. Selby had, it is true, an independent fortune; yet it was not a large one : he, therefore, though of a benevolent, hospitable dif position, was willing to live in a retired manner, that he might be able to Save Something for his daughters, as his real estate would descend to his Son: he chose also to make Some provision for his wife, though he had married her without any money. She was the daughter of a merchant, Settled in a country town, where he had been upon Some 
business; and he happened to take a 
fancy 
I

fancy to her, as she was, at that time, in the eyes of most people, a very pretty woman. She was, indeed, at the commencement of this narrative, not in the least disagreeable in her per son. Her retired; tranquil life, from the time of her marriage, having greatly contributed to the preservation of her, health, and the uniform flow' of her ■ Spirits, in consequence of which she had a blooming complexion, and a brilliancy to a pair of as beautiful eyes iis were 
ever placed in a human head. With 
/ 
these personal advantages, 'she was certainly qualified to make no bad figure at the baronet’s house; and she was ssattered enough by them' to believe, that file should not be eclipsed by, her owt daughters, who were generally called very fine girls. They were, indeed, tall and strait; they had clear, 
B 4 aniihated 

'8 . animated complexions, good teeth and 
I 
hair. Molly, the eldest, had the most Spirit in her eyes; Fanny was remarkable for the delicacy of her form, and the whiteness of her hands and arms. Their brother was also well made, and had, in his agreeable, manly countenance, sensibility strongly ex pressed. His father, willing to give him every opportunity of improving the talents nature had bestowed on him, had Sent him to - Cambridge, that he might be qualified, by an university education, for ecclesiastical preferment, should he happen to have a call to the church. With regard to his daughters, he did not want them to pos fess any other qualifications than thosc which might tend to make them good wives and good mothers, to the men. who should chuse to pass their lives with them. 
He

ije put into their hands, at a very early age. Some of the best English authors, while their mother, who had no great relish for books, taught them, example, to roll their eyes, and Set their caps, at all the men who came in their way; frequently telling them, that women, with ' tolerable persons, might always make their fortunes,, if they 
I 
would mind what they were about adding, that she had herself married with nothing; and that though she might have perhaps done better, there were women, who had married; worse.. 
Selby having been long weary of a retired life, was Secretly as much rejoiced at the intelligence communicated to her by her daughter, as she appeared' to be, though she had every rational 
amusement at her command. The

house was very pleasantly situated r it had been built by Mr. selby’s father r it was quite a convenient building; it was neatly furnished, and it wanted nothing to render it every way eligible. There was also a good deal of land round it. It stood, indeed, in the middle of a garden, v/hieli was. both pleasant and profitable, being extremely well laid out, and containing all Sorts of vegetables for the use, and a considerable number 
of flowers and flirubs, for the enter

of the family. Mr. Selby too. employed, iiimfclf ia the farming way kept Several horses of course,. and those horses occasionally rolled his wife and' daughters about the country, %yhen they were disposed to make little excursions.. a post coach, which he built on purpose to oblige Mrs..

Mr. Selby had also a good collecftioii 
of books: he was not a man of the 
$ 
world, but he was a man of fense, and had received the best school learnino: 
o 
the country could afford. In the younger part of his fife he had been a great lover of reading, and had a taste for musick, Sufficient to enable him to a muse himself with playing a little upon the organ and violin, both, which instruments he retained in his house: though 
O ^ 
after his children grew up, he Seldom meddled with, them, devoting his whole time and attention to “the improvement of his Small fortune, for the Sake of his familyi However, as his Son and younger daughter had often importuned him to.'instru61: them in a Science which " B 6 pto “
\ 
\ 
12 . 
promised to afford them much plcasure, having both a particular passion for music, and melodious voices, he now and then gave them a lesson upon the organ; but he cautioned them, at the Same time, not to apply closely. to music, lest they might be prevented by it from paying their attention to things of more consequence. Fanny, notwithstanding 
her father’s precaution, would Sometimes 
Sing, though rudely, while her brother accornpanied her upon the organ; and they Sometimes joined in a duet. The two girls also drew well enough to Save the expenses of patterns for Working aprons, rushes, cc. these amusements, with visits to the few neighbours they had, kept them from growing melancholy in their re tirernent. Their neighbours were most ' of them chearfulj good-natured, people, 
and

and Such people, though not very highly polished, are a thousand times more valuable than those who, with the most re' ' accomplishments, have had their minds corrupted by an imitation of the manners of the fashionable world. 
With the young and lively part of their neighbours, the miss Selbys Sometimes Schemed a dance, and Sometimes planned other amusements, in order to fill up their vacant hours in a winterevening, innocently. Cards were absolutely banished from their little Social meetings. Cards, indeed, were particularly discouraged by Mr. Selby himself: he never played, neither at home or abroad; and as he had many reasons to disapprove of their being introduced into his family, he always in 
I 
yeighed warmly against them. He never 
would 
 
vrould let his children, play — Cards promote a habit of sitting too long, which is very pernicious, and prejudicial to health and Spirits, and occasion nun berless disorders. They also give too great a Spur to the passions, and excite many of the most destructive kind, espe eialiy avarice. There k Sufficient reason to believe that the love of play opens the door to many low arts, and shabby proceedings disgraceful, to man, and detrimental to Society. 
, In consequence of these capital ob jefbions to card playing, Mr. Selby took every possible method to prevent his children from contracting an inclination for it; and was, indeed, extremely Solicitous to cure them of every the llight cst folly to which they were naturally addicted, or which they had caught by 
asso 
associating with their acquaintance. However, though the young Selbys were thus discreetly brought up, though they were never checked by any un reasonable restraints, and though they shared in all the pleasures of the country, there were So many things which they had not Seen, which they had heard of, and of which' they warrted to hear more, that they were delighted at the coming down of a family from London; not in the least doubting but that theiy could give them all the wished for, information. 
Mrs. Selby was pkased, because she, fancied she should make herself of more. consequence, by her connexions with, people of fashion, and increashig her ac epiaintance "wnth persons in high life.. By Such connedtshns she expected to tri. «

enough to know whether they had any neighbours or not, to pay them a visity with the thorough approbation of her daughters, who earnestly pressed her,. 
% 
indeed, to go and See themi They were quite eager to see Ladies jjlist arrived from London; and, accordingly,, began to make preparations for their visit the preceding evening. That they might appear in the best manner pos fible, their hair had been kept in paper all the day; they were, in short, So busied in making up their rushes and tipi 

pets, that they had not a single moment to Spare. Their father called upon them,

but they were not ready. In the evening, therefore, instead of walking in the grounds, or fields, as they used to do —, (in the middle of July —) on finding none of them visible, he went upstairs to his wife’s apartment There he Saw them all together consulting about C p.s. 
anti ribbons, gowns and petticoats.

On his desiring to know why they shut themselves up in Such fine weather, Mrs. Selby replied, “We are very busy

‘‘ in getting things ready to go to Sir “Thomas lumley’s; arid I hope, my 
1 t

“Yes, indeed, but I can, ” replied she, rather warmly : “Sir Thomas and “his family are our neighbours; and “all people visit their neighbours. Be“ “they are So genteel an acquain “tance, and So proper to give our “girls a notion of high life, and to 
teach them how to behave themselves “if ever Such a life fnould be their lot;

“that I think they will have a charm“ “opportunity to improve them“ “
‘‘ Umph !”

“Umph!” cried Mr. Selby; then, 
after a short pausc, added — “In what “very different lights we See things now, my dear? — But to answer you “circumstantially. — In the first place, “r do not See the least neceshty there

With these words, delivered with an uncommon earnestiness, he went downstairs, leaving Mrs, Selby in no very

good listmour, though she had carried her point. She mattered a great many Severe things against her husband, be i fore she could compose her mind enough 
to pirrsue the employment of choosing her clothes, which Mr. Selby interrupted,

As to the miss Selbys, they loved! their father exceedingly, as he had always 
been kind and indulgent to them; but, like too many other young people, th also wished to See life, from a mere longing after something new: they were not only desirous of a change, they ardently 
wished to sty from the tranquil Scenes in which they had lived from their earliest days, and to figure in the

great world. ■ — Cheerfully, therefore, they did what their mother ordered them To do; and performed their appointed tashs with an avidity which would have done them great honour, had they been employed in a more laudable manner. 
When they came down to slipper, Mr. Selby, who was, in the stri(5lest sense of the words, a mild tem pered man, intended to have rallied thcin upon their having mis fpent So fine an evening; but he had been too long accustomed to Mrs. selby’s manner of behaving, not to perceive that she would be affronted by any kind of pleasantry upon the Subject in question: he, therefore, agreeably to Matt. prior’s priident advice, resolved to — “eat his “pudding, and hold his tongue.”

the attending expenses; that he would have his own nasiy way— — she Called it — if he could; and that she could hope 
to carry her point but by one way of proceeding — by making his life uneasy, by oppostng him in everything, and by obliging him to part with his money to purchase the peace which he enjoyed, before his family had entertained notions So unsuitable to their situation in life : a Situation in which he was desirous of Seeing them remain, as he could not afford to place them dna more elevated Iphere; nor indeed did he believe

Selby was a very worthy, and a very sensible mast, but he was not proof against the perpetual applications, teasingly made to him, for pecuniary Supplies.

As for Fanny, she, being of a more gentle and affectionate disposition tharr Molly, would have been, quite happy with Tom, had he been the younger Son; if her mother and lister,,, as well as the miss Lumleys, had not been always saying,, no .people are looked upon [ who are not both in genteel and affluent

ft 
that when they were contrasted with her beauties, they were Soon forgotten. The latter took possession of his mind, and 
I 
i baffled all his befl; resolutrons. He could 
no longer resolve not to see again the woman who had rejected him; he secretly pined for an opportunity to en deavour, by the moll assiduous attentions, ^ to make her entertain sentiments luore favourable to him.

Fanny, while her lover was in this (iisquieteel state, thought only of Mr. Lumley, and pined as much after N'ii? as Lewfon did after her. 
About this time Charles Selby arrived 
¥ 
from Cambridge to spend the vacation 
at his father’s. He was a well made, 
‘ 
genteel, handsome young fellow, with a 
very 
t 
I 
|| il! I uro , 
i very good natural understanding, which 
he had taken pains to improve; and as his father had designed him for the church, he threw more feriousnefs into his countenance than generally appears in the faces of young men in the prime of life. Few young fellows indeed were of a more thinking turn: he loved read ing, music, and drawing: he was a no bad performer on' the harpsichord, and I had a very pleasing voice, in the management 
of which he discovered great taste. 
The girls, who were fond of their brother, flew to Welcome him, and with their heads full of the Lumleys began, to tell him what a charming family they were acquainted with. They ran on for sometime with Such vclubility that he could hardly take in or comprehend what III they seemed to wish him to know, but

; which they were incapable from their. 
I eagerness of communicating : at least

'with the preciston which he appeared to 
expect from them. He Smiled, however, 
f 
\ at their excessive vivacity, while he entreated 
therfi to Speak one at a time, and with more composure, that he might understand them.

I II The Mist Lurnleys, though by n

They, both, at once, began to make an attack upon his heart. Charlotte, with an indolent foftness in her manner, cast her eyes, every now and then, languisti

him, with all the vivacity in her power. 
\ 
For a considerable time the poor, de fcnceless youth was in doubt which of them he Should prefer. Not that he was perplexed from any natural inconstancy 
4 
of disposition; he was only distradted by 
the various and opposite charms of his assailants 
\ 
at length, gained a decisive victory over her sister. The grace and elegance of her form, the fnovvy whiteness of her neck and hands, and

In this situation they for sometime remained. Molly, unable to exist without one lover, when her sister had two,, did everything in her power to fix the attention of George Lumley entirely to herself: but he was far top volatile: I yet,

I “on Mr. and Mrs. Selby to Spend the 
j “winter in London also.” 
^1 Fanny, though by no means in a plea 
Igjlj font humour, could not help stniling at 
in what she looked upon as the most impro 
I bable of all improbable schemes— — 
“Nothing upon earth, I am Sure, ” Said 
j she, “will make my father quit his

Lumley replied, “A very trifle will “soon make your mother determine I ■ “upon it immediately; and I really I think Mr. Selby ought to comply

with a request of this kind— — is a “pity to keep two, such fine girls, as “you and your sister are, confined in so “retired a place, without letting you “see a little of life, and giving you “both an opportunity at least to make “your fortunes.” 
The careless ease with which Lumley mentioned Fanny with her sister, upon 
ft 
this occasion, perfectly convinced her that he had not the least intention of marrying her. She figheel again; yet llie thought with him, that it w” as a pity stie and her sister Should lose the golden opportunity he mentioned. 
The first time Fanny happened to be alone with her sister, she repeated what 
Lumley 

Lumley had said to her concerning them in a negligent manner. 
'Molly, not having had the smallest idea of the Lumleys leaving the country, was quite struck at the intelligence, and exclaimed — “Good God! This place, “will be absolutely a desert when thy 
“are gone. We must persuade our mother to go too.” 
You may easily persuade my mo“ “” said Fanny; “but, I think, Ijil “my father will never be prevailed

As soon as the last word was out of her mouth, stie ran to Mrs. Selby, and informed her that they Should soon lose Sir Thomas and Lady Lumley.

Mrs, Selby, though She was much hurt by this information, was willing, like many other people, to push'off the evil day; and not chusing to believe what was So very disagreeable to her, repsied — “It is impossible— — “down on purpose to live retired, and “to Save money; it is not at all likely, “therefore, that they should return to “London.” 
Molly answered, “I am pretty Sure, ‘‘ that my intelligence is true, as my 
“Sister received it from Mr. Lumley. —

“i O 
to converse with in the whole place. and because it was imposhble for people to live always together, without speaking to Somebody) flared at this address, the freedom of which she thought pretty extraordinary. Looking full at the

“me but get to so charming a place, 
“and all will go well — I shall then be “able to look out for my self.” She 
ft 
was chiefly puzzled how to procure from Mr. Selby a shm fushcient to defray the expenses of her journey, and to pay for her apartments. As to what would be requiflte for their subsistence, she imagined that it would not come to more in London than it did in 
t 
the country — “We must eat, let us “live where we will.” — But fly never 
ft 
considered that a divided family mufl spend a great deal more than a united one. Everybody knows that half a dozen people can live cheaper together than separately 
\ 
Selby broke this great affair to her husband in the best manner she could. 
She told him that it would be hut for 
1 ' " once', 
* N 
 
cnce -, and that, if he would trufi to her he would be amply, repaid. — “I an ■ “resolved hovrever, ” added she, - “n “go, whether you like it or no: aru if I do not, the lodgings, as the; are taken, imifl; be paid for : we hat “better, therefore, make the most o “them, ” 
': In this way, partly by scolding, anc partly by coaxing, Mrs. Selby carriet her point: but Mr. Selby could noi bring himself to consent to her Journey to London, without the greatest reluctance. 
While this important bullness was 
transadting at xt farm. Sir Thomas and his family — hurried as much by my lady — left Lumley place, and arrived II berkley sc]uare. — They only, took a fly 
 
j ing leave of the Selbys, without getting ^ out of their coach. — Mr. i..umley indeed had a private interview with Fanny. Selby the night before, and Charles Seh bv also had an interview with Miss Lumley. Charles found a marvellous coolness in his companion: being on the point of returning to a place which swarmed 'With men, she became quite 
ft 
i indifferent about her young academical 
lover, who, 'by his father’s exprcss commands/was to go back to Cambridge, when he had seen his mother and filter 
I 
! safe in London. 
ll 
F 
i T he buffnefs now in debate was how 
L, 
! to get to the metropolis. Mrs. Selby 
wanted to travel in her own carriage, 
* O 
like Lady Lumley, and to keep it, after her arrival in London for her owii life: but she could not, by any means, 
prevail 
I 

'H'' - ■ ^ 
S; i prevail on Mr. Selby to conlent to the 
llfji removal of Dick and his horses. She 
II was, therefore, obliged to be content 
I with places in the Itage for herself her 
daughters, and her Ion. 
I o ^ 
I Exceedingly mortified by this vulgar 
I fnode, of travelling, she took care to 
deafen the .other two paliengers all the way; telling them upon every trifling occasion that fly had never been used to travel in a stagecoach, r Nr pr, and did not understand Such mean doings. 
The miss Selbys, both, followed their mother’s example in this respect,, though they Saw the other pafltengers were country people, and lick to death with riding backwards, having probably, never been in a coach before (at 
least 
% 
. 169 
least not for a long time) would not condescend to offer them their own seats 
ft 
opposite to them. The nearer they came to London, the higher they held. ' up their heads; and were totally difcon cerred at being obliged to step into a hackney coach in order to be carried to 
their lodgings. However, when they 
• \ 
came to those lodgings, on the second floor, they were delighted with them: 
A » • 
they were transported to See So many people pass and repass: they wtre charmed with the noise and bustle in the street from morning tonight. — They were every moment amazed : yet they 
were not so deeply engaged by staring

Beginning, therefore, to wonder that he had heard nothing of her,, he made inquiries of Charlotte; and Jhe gave him the most ludicrous description of the apartment at Mrs. puff’s to be imagined. Notwithstanding that description, however, he hastened to See her; and found her, on the abovementioned morning, alone.

Sally Cox had not a very pleasing

person, but she had a good deal of that Simplicity in her behaviour, which has the greatest appearance of innocence : and as she was also a sensible girl, she ■ was quite agreeable to such a kind of man as young Selby. She sung too in a soothing, affecting style, and was mif. tress of a number of little allurements, which made him think less than ever of Miss Lumley; though he would not have been so much taken with Miss Cox, at first, had she not strongly resembled that Lady. But what particularly contributed to attack him entirely to her

Mr. Lumley found her rather unwilling, at'first, to listen to any apology he could make for his apparent ncgl'ed: he, at length, however, convinced her that he really had not been to blame, as he was detained at the house of a sick friend longer than .he intended to Stay there.

Fanny then gently touched upon the cool reception which her brother had met with in berldey fquare, and upon the pains his mother and filler had taken to put her family out of conceit with 
.m 
their lodging, with their acquaintance, with everything about them. 
He excused the reception her brother had met with, as well as he could, by saying that they kept so much company in London, it was very difficult to find them ever disengaged; and that, in the world, people were obliged to pay an outward respeft to numbers whom they, in their hearts, defpised; adding, that cufiom, and indeed necessity, rendered such a conduct Sometimes unavoidable, though it was most commonly very disagreeable. — “As to your apartment, “my dear Fanny, ” continued he, looks

ithe thoughts of parting with him for ■ever: So uncommonly Soft, tender, and ‘engaging was he at the moment she was on the point of a final separation from him. Her heart was deeply affedbed by his so moving behaviour; her pride also was not slightly wounded — From the commencement of her acquaintance with him, she had flattered herself with the hopes — though they were distant ones — of being one day Lady Lumley; shut now all her hopes were totally dei

tnolifhed. She could not nov rationally indulge her brilliant expedlations. She was, therefore, very sensible that llie had nothing to do, but to put an entire end to an intimacy which could not but prove dangerous as well as dishonourable. Yet the pleasure she had, from the very first, taken in his company, was so great, and had astefled her So 
sensibly, 
✓

. 203, 
sensibly, that Ihe knew not how to consent to a separation, the necessity for which was but too plain. 
Lumley, who clearly saw all that paflfed in her heart, found he had more interest there than he believed he had; and the discovery made him more loth to part with her. When She rose up, therefore, impatient, from the anxiety she could not Suppress, and told him, it 
was absolutely neceltary for him to leave herj started out of his chair, and clasping 
her with ardour to his bosom, swore that he could not go; that he wouldfooner part with his life than with the only woman he had ever loved. “Let us wait, “my Fanny, ” added he, feeing her melted with his tenderness“ “us wait “for better times : let us be true to

Poor Fanny, almost lost in love, quite lost to herself, without a fingk friend to advise her, at length murmured out her consent to wait for him, upon his bosom.

of a surprise by the return of the family, took care to conduct himself in Such a manner, as to create no Suspicions of his having any other design than the Seizure of a few innocent caresses.. which, for the first time, gave her as much pleasure as she gave him.

Mrs. Selby told Fanny, they had been looking at the prettiest lodgings, which were recommended to them by Mr. Smith, the mistress of the house being one of his acquaintance; that they were much nearer the court, and at a private 
house; and that they miight have a firjl

When he had ventured thus far, he looked significantly at Maria, and brushed off to give the famjly time to chew upon what he had Said: and indeed 'his 
back was no Sooner turned than Mrs. Selby began to think that Since taking in Itxlgers and boarders was both como 

mon among great people,, and genteel, she should gain both more respefl and acquaintance by being miftress of the .house, than by living in lodgings. She, accordingly, 'altered the plan of her letter, and told Mr. Selby, that as lodgings were, she found, equally disagreeable and expensive, she had thoughts of taking a small house, adding, that she could Save considerably by So doing, aster the first money was laid out

There is some apology, however, to be made for the conduct of Fanny upon this occasion: she really was fond of Lumley, and had no reason to believe that he did not love her. She was cer tainly biameabk in yielding at all; but as she gave up her person merely from a sincere desire of obliging the man she loved, and not from any interested motives, she could not be pronounced absolutely a though not, in the 
ftricstest sense of the word, a virtuous girl. Pleased as she was with being dressed and admired; pleased with living'among people of fashion, and .doing as they did, Fanny would not, on any account, have consented to become the mist ress of the man whomshe

could not love. Much happier would

Poor Fanny, as soon as She was Sensible of her iituatiori, felt all the hor ror of it. She had been virtuously educated : she had not, naturally, any bad dispositions. When she found, there fore, that it was no longer in her power

any woman, merely on account, of her personal beauties. Sorry to See her disturbed at what had given him So much pleasure, he strove, immediately, to administer a consolation to her, and advanced a great number of arguments in favour of the accident that had happened; as many examples did he urge, to prove that there was nothing particular in Nr behaviour, except the extreme delicacy of it, in which, he said, he adored her; adding, that no woman of fashion, either single or married, was in the least Scrupulous about indulging herself, when she met with a favourite lover; that if the man indulged was a man of probity, and if the affair was managed with address, there was nothing in it; and that he hoped she did not doiibt either his honour or his love. He concluded with assuring her, that 
his 
tt 
/ 
_ •

Ms purse and person should be always at her command, and declared, in short, 
i 
that he would do everything to malce iier easy, but marry her; as he was de itermined not to part with his liberty., 
but upon the most advantageous terms \ 
^, and to vrear only golden chains, should

st 
* - ‘ 
this, resplute and decisive Speech, 
Lumley undid all that he had been try 
/ 
to do : it threw poor Fanny into Such a’ fit of despair, that it was with the greatest dishculty he could keep her from falling fenselefs at his feet., even felt exceedingly for the distress he 
0 
had occasioned; yet he thought, at the Same time, it was better to have the worst over at once, that there might be no after reckoning. When she knew 
r « 
what she had to expect, fly would, fie 
imagined, 
/ 
f 
\ 
24 . 
t 
imagined, make the most of it; he therefore employed every Soothing art he was master of, to calm her mind; and discovered, in his every look, in all his accents, the tenderest Solicitude on her account. By his tender endeavours he, at last. Softened her heart to Such a degree, that she Soon became more ready to renew her indiscretions, 
than to quarrel with him for obliging her to commit them. • 
When he had left her — when the mortifying resteftions which had been for sometime banished, returned, and with double violence — she again lamented 
tt : 
her fall, with the bitterest expressions: she felt herself totally deprived of all her tranquillity. She resolved, however, to conceal her feelings, and to affect a Serenity in her behaviour, at all events, 
■ '. as 
. 
as she had not given up all hopes of being able, one day, to prevail on her lover to marry her, though he was then So averse to iriatrimony: and, indeed, his extreme fondness of her, after an incident which frequently cures a man of his affection for the woman Seduced by him, induced her strongly to imagine that she might, by a gentle, complying carriage, bring him to consent to make all the reparation in his power for the loss of her honour: Supposing that, by marrying him, she should be as good as ever. — Into this error many females are apt to Aide; and too easily console themselves for the loss of what they ought 
to think irreparable. The preservation 
\ 
a character unsullied, not the patching if up, when a flaw has been made in it, should be every woman’s principal concern.

Poor Fanny, 
disc 
mow taught .to be artful, endeavoured to put the best face she could upon the matter, and to appear tolerably composed when the family came; home; though her mind was tortured by recoueflion^ in a manner not to be described. Her eyes were red with weeping; but her mother and Sister were too much taken up with their own affairs to attend to her. Mrs. Selby, indeed, was more alert than she had been ever Since her marriage. 

It has been already Said that Mrs. Selby was a fine showy woman. From the moment of her arrival in London, ^ file employed the greatest part of her time in hurrying from one place of di version to another, and was up early and .late in the pursuit of pleasure; yet, as 
she 
\

she had not followed that life long, she had not impaired her constitution, nor destroyed the bloom of her complexion. She was also, naturally, of a lively temper, and her vivacity gave a brightness to her eyes, a brilliancy to her whole appearance, which made her a desirable object. She had been much taken notice of, on the abovementioned even 
V » 
ing, by an officer, who played at the table to which she was sat down; and 
, i 
4 
she encouraged him not a little by giving herself flirting airs; airs hardly excusable 
in her daughters. It was not, however, her person alone that induced Captain Dermot to be particularly attentive to her : he had made an inquiry about her, and Smith had communicated to him the following information — “that she had left her husband, to come ' “to See London, and to live like other

words. Smith, who was a regular and frequent visiter, entered the room, accompanied by Dermot, whom he intro' 
'\ 
by telling her that the Captain would not let him rest tillshe had brought him to pay his compliments to her. — 
“But what are you reading, my dear “Mrs. Selby ?” added he — “A letter “from an admirer So early ?”

“blessings they enjoy in the possession “of the moss charming women in the “world. There are, however, other “men neither blind, to their beauties,

This civil speech, and the glances .with which it was accompanied, gave 
Mrs. Selby a pleasure which she could not conceal. She Smirked, and drew up her head, and.sidled in her chair. - Then, holding out the letter to Fanny, 
4 
she cried, with a coquettish air, “Here, 
“girl; do you read it; for there js

At this time Fanny — though her mother was ignorant of her situation— — 
in consequence of her reflections, inexpressibly 
wretched: they were almost: insupportable. It was, indeed, owing 
to her too great fensibility that she had been conquered by Lumley. Shedoved him, and having, from her first acquaintance with him, romantically expedsed to be, one day. Lady Lumley, * had given herself up to the indulgence of a thousand freedoms which he looked upon as preludes to the lafl. Fanny, it hs true, firmly resolved not to grant the lafi favour, till her lovet was legally entitled to it: but let no woman, presuming upon her resolution, in a Similar 
Situa

Situation, allow or receive freedoms not to be warranted by diferetion. She will,. i most probably, find her lover encroach 
upon her tender compliances, and her -- self ruined by them. 
I 
Fanny, though She had. often heard of broken vows, could not bring herself 
/ 
to think that Lumley would be a faith -- less man. She thought it imposhble — notwithfianding all she had heard of the inconstancy of the sex— — her lover to 
0 
she less fond, less aftedlionate. — His in difference was quite out of the question. Strongly believing him to be inviolably attached to her, she, naturally, believed that he might, in consequence of the sincerity of his attachment, be prevailed upon to marry her. — As she was not married, however, and as., many things might happen to prevent her marriage, 
she 
tt 
. 39 
(he could not help sighing;; could not help wishing that Jshe had not yielded before the nuptial ceremony had been performed. 
# 
While Fanny was in this situation;; Such reflections as these took pos seflion of her mind, Lumley, though not quite satiated, was, by no means, so eager as he was before. He liked Fanny as a miftress, because he knew that She was fond of him alone; and yet condudled herself with a delicacy not to be met with in the common run of kept mistresses: : was therefore very willing to be connected with her in that way, but grew more and more determined to listen to no other. 
Agreeably to this determination Lumj*" lay, the next time he saw Fanny, be,

, haved to sher with an apparently corrected tenderness, with that Sort of fond 
* 
indeed which a man discovers for ' « 
the wife of his choice when the honeymoon is just over. By this behaviour he made her hope that she might still gain her point, though Ihe so sincerely repented of not having obtained it at first, that she could not have any rest. She was greatly afraid that something' would happen to blast: her hopes. She 
strove to conceal the anxiety She endured, in consequence of her apprehensions; but to no purpose : it was, in Spite of all her care, perceived, and by the very person least pleased with it; by Lumley, who now, as she not only looked unhappy every time he saw her, shut 
continually teased him to repair the injury he had done, began to wish that he had never had anything to do with 
her 

/ 
Her at all. Under the influence of such a wish he saw her less.frequently than usual. The long intervals between his vihts occasioned a thousand complaints on her fide. Her complaints rendering Jiim apprehensive that she would expose herself to his family, he resolved to be 
it 
absent when she came with her mother and filler to Lady lumley’s rout. 
i 
While fanny’s affairs were in this disagreeable Situation, Smith began to think it was high time for him to get pofseffion of Maria, who had held out, he imagined, merely because he had not been So prefllng as Lumley, whose amour' with Fanny, in Spite of all his endeavours to conceal it, was discovered by him. It was fanny’s sondness for her lover, not to be hidden, ' which occa stoned the discovery,

Maria had none of her fifter’s tender sensations;; liked to be admired, but file troubled herself very little about being beloved. She .was exceedingly delighted with dress, and with parade of every kind. Provided she was fine, and made a brilliant appearance she was satisfied. She had no idea of sitting down contented with the man of her heart, in an elegant retreat, like her sister. Had she married the most amr able man in the world, she, most pro r shably, would have left him the next moment to go in search of another as amiable. 
She could not bear any sort of confinement : she was perpetually hurrying from place to place in quest of, what is called, pleasure and her taste for difii 
p/ation had been considerably incrcased.

by her acquaintance with the Lumleys y by her intimacy with Smith, 
Maria was encouraged by Smith in her pleasurable pursuits: he was in hopes that she would, intoxicated by the diversions of the tov: n, become just the woman he desired her to be. Ta 
X 
facilitate her fall from virtue, he had recommended the present lodgings,,, as he well knew that the mistress of the: house would wink at many things which, others, in her circumstances, would not suffer. Besides, as she had been serviceable to him upon many. occasions, and as he believed that Mrs. Selby and. her family would be very easily duped, he thought the placing them there 
would be a great ad\'’antage to Mrs.. Henfon, who, if she got money,, was,

Mrsv Henfon, indeed, made such quick demands upon Mrs. Selby, that she began to find her purse rather light; 
yet she never once thought of returning home, or of making retrenchments in town. On the contrary, she determined to enlarge her expenses..

Happening to Say to Lady Lumley, the evening, her Ladyship did her the honour to admit her to her rout, that she fancied she paid more than she ought for same things, she answered“ “won“ “you continue in ready furnished lodgings : a house would not only be “more genteel, but less expensive:

The familiar attitudes in which the miss Lumleys permitted their noble admirers to lean over them, and the unlimited freedoms they not only endured,

but encouraged, rendered them very bad patterns for Maria, and for Fanny, who, though fly had imprudently yielded to

Fanny, when she saw the miss Lumleys — whon) she had always looked upon as objeds of imitation — behave in the manner abovementioned, began to think that she had not been quite so much to blame in making her lover happy; but if their behaviour had so bad an effect upon her, who had granted the last favour to Lumley, merely from her inability to see him miserable on her account, it had a much worse one upon

A masquerade being now advertised at the Pantheon, Mrs. Selby and Maria were half distracted, first to procure tickets, and then to fix upon drefies. The mother, at last, chose that of a Sultana:

very much the appearance of a Gentleman. This new admirer of hers had no rest; till he inquired who she was. On, somebody’s telling him that her name I; Was Selby; that she was the daughter,

With these sentiments rolling in hb mind, Charles determined to write to his father, and to deferkl his conduct in the best manner he could; thinking he 'should, by a fair state of his case in every respest, contribute to the alleviation: of that grief which he must naturally have felt upon hearing what had happened • to shim.

he was not much deceived — Fanny, had she not been seduced by the example of her mother and sister, and of the lum lay family, would never, it is probable, have wished to leave a parent whose indulgence she had ever experienced, and by whom she was always distinguished., Lewfon, as much prepossessed as he was in her behalf, found his affection for her rather increased by her father’s partiality : she was doubly dear to him by being hk favourite. He looked upon every mark of her father’s preference as an additional proof of her merit; and, when he saw there was no poshbility of gaining her heart, he transferred a great part of the. esteem and affection which he felt for to Mr., Selby. With these disposttions towards them, it is no

tell him that Something Very disagreeable had happened, to prevent his attendance agreeable to his promise, he came to another determination. He re

solved to call upon him, in order to know whether his fears were well grounded. 
Lewfon found Mr. Selby with the 
f 
melancholy paper in his hand, and, with a countenance which expressed more than words can describe'' 
'' 
As Soon as Mr. Selby Saw lewson ad •vancing, he held the paper — “Read “here, my friend, ” Said the amiable,. distressed man, looking earnestly at him. Then, clasping shis hands in an agony of gries, and with uplifted eyes, he added — “Good God! Can there posti

to be particularly interested in the event

which had occasioned it — (and he was quite ignorant of her being so) immediately desired Mr. Selby to endeavour to make himself easy; adding, that he would, as soon asshis father was buried, fet out directly for London, and do everything in his power to serve his fon, 
Selby, grasping his hand, told him, that he was more his Tonne than ever Charles had been. i — “I will go to Lon

■ i 
He kept his word; but before that time, Mr. Selby had received charles’s letter, in which he not only informed him of fanny’s illness, and of his own unhappy rencontre, but also mentioned his marriage; apologising for having acted against his approbation, by pleading his honour, which would have been

was too much shocked by the blow not to fink under it. Her fever, which had been cohfiderabiy abated, returned with double violence, and she was again confined to her bed. i 
Lew'son, who had, every day, begged to speak to her, and had, every 
day, been refused, was now, at her own 
tt ^

request, permitted to See her. He approached her with a concern and tenderness in his looks and manner which 
tt 
must have very much affected her, had she been in a different state 'of mind. After having expresfed his sorrow for her Sufferings, and his wishes for her recovery, he ventured to mention the de iiglitsul expedations he once indulged of having it in his power to make her happy: : that he could not yet i prevail

prevail on himself to give up his ex pedations entirely, as he had heard that 
\ 
she was to return with her father to the farm, and as he hoped to have an opportunity to render himself one day ac

ceptable to her. 
The wishes in this speech, warmly, and with the most apparent sincerity, with a modest diffidence, at the same time, delivered, awakened every soft 
fcnsation in her heart; and her strong 
* ^ 
emotions were visible in every feature of her face. She now regretted, truly regretted her having refused Such a man,, and still more forcibly felt her folly, as. she had suffered so severely, in consequence of her refusal.

Charles had a considerable share in it; but this addition to the troubles of the family so disgusted Maria, that while they were grieving for her sister, she, unobserved, packed up her own clothes, and the best .which belonged to Fanny, and made off. 
Mrs. Selby, who had not discovered 
more concern for Fanny than Maria had, was, at the Same time, engaged in writing a letter to Captain.dermot, to acquaint him with all her grievances, and to let him know, that she should be the most miserable creature upon earth, if she was obliged to go and live in the 
country. She concluded with a broad hint, strongly signifying, that it would be more agreeable to her to remain in 
London, if she could meet wdth any

By the time the hour of supper arrived, this curious epistle was ready for the post; but thinking that its conveyance by the post would neither be fafc enough, nor expeditious enough, she dispatched Sukey with it. 
As the cook could not leave her kitchen, Mr. Selby began to call loudly for Maria, to go and sit by her sister, who was just laid out upon the bed.

It was then Maria was first missed, '

f 
Several days having passed without 
\ 
bringing any tidings of Maria, Mr. Selby and Charles began to be very uneasy. The latter," by making inquiries about her of all their town acquainb 
ance, gained an infight into smith’s 
* 
character, and found that he subsisted' chiefly by furnishing those men with fresh, girls, who could afford to pay for them',, and taking unfair advantages of raw,. 
ft 
ignorant adventurers at play he von 
• 
therefore, that he had not recommended Maria'to somebody as a. mitt 

stress; but he was told, that though she was quite a new object in town, her manners were So licentious, and that she had 
So little sense of shame, that every man 
would 
. 20^ 
would believe her — (merely for want of the modest appearance which renders even women of pleasure more alluring) to be an old Jiager, and not worth the purchase. That sort of assurance, however, though disgusting to many, is not So to all. There are Some who are pleased with it. 
/ 
Maria, in her flight from home, met George Lumley coming out of a bagnio. She accosted him with all the impudence of a common prostitute, and asked him to give her a glass of wine, as her Spirits were low. Upon this Salutation, looking in her face, by tl^ light of the lamp close to him, he recolledted her, though he had been drinking champagne till he could hardly See — st Whew! — what? — Maria st Selby cried he — st No, no — • ■ / st child

st Bravely resolved, girl, ” cried a young man of fashion, who was following Lumley; I take you at your word — Then, pushing her into the bagnio before him, he kept her there all the time her father and brother were in search of her; and being soon heartily tired of her, left her to find out a new keeper.

Maria, instead of discovering any concern at being deserted by him, told him, that she was quite as weary of Amas he could be of her; that dear variety ever was, and ever would be, 
her choice, and that she was above be 
1 
ing corihned to any man. - 
. ^ r 
\ 
Her father and brother at last met with her, but found it imposhble to convince her that she was seeking her own destruction. She told them, that the quiet retired life she must lead at the farm would be death to her; that ■she had never known any joy till the 
Lumleys came down to -- -- -- -- -- -- -- shire; 
and that a life of pleasure was the only lise for her. 
\ 
In answer to this free declaration, they told her, that though such a life

might, possibly, appear the most pleasant one to her, She would but too Soon find there was no lise could be So

“And this 1 am Sure of, it is impofii “ble for me to live like a woman of “fashion at home; and as I like no other style of life, I vv'ill rather “enjoy that, tho’ for ever so short a time, than mope away years of me“

Mr. Selby was extremely shocked to hear his daughter talk in this way: he forced her, however, into a coach, carried her home, and locked her up, till he went down to the farm. 
When fanny’s funeral was over, 
Mr. Selby put Maria into a coach with her mother, (who received not a single hint of consolation from Captain Dermot before she Set out). When he got down to his farm, he disposed of a great part of his estate, paid all his wife’s debts, and fettled what i*emained on his Son, that he might be able to pay Sally Cox — for So he ever called it — her allowance. By proceeding in this manner, Mr. Selby made Such a reduction of his income, that Mrs. Selby was obliged to be content with the bare necessaries of life, instead of

the many comforts she enjoyed before she became desirous of imitating Lady Lumley. 
^) 
As to, Lady Lumley, she and her family were far from being happy. Sir Thomas, by his return to London that winter, which had proved so unfortunate to the Selbys, had spent all, and more than he had saved in his fummer retreat. He was, therefore, driven to a 
small estate he had near the land’s End. • — There he and his family were necesh tated, urged by ceconomicai motives, to spend the remainder of their days. In tloat retirement the miss Lumleys became old women without being wives, having neither fortunes nor characters to recommend them. The eldest fon, the seducer of poor Fanny Selby, had it no longer in his power to boast of any ' conquests 
• •

conquests of that kind, or to triumph over the expiring virtue of any other fond female, as the wound which he had received from Charles Selby had entirely disabled him from having any farther 
amorous connedlions with the. fair sexto whom his brother fell a martyr in another manner., 
\ 
Maria Selby a(5ted in the way she intended: eluding all her father’s vigilance, she returned to london, became a common prostitute, and died in a coui 
dition, too shocking to be described. 
* 
With, regard, to Mrs. Selby, as she could not procure a Separate allowance from her husband,, was obliged to remain, at the farm. There she gave herself so many airs of a woman of fashion,. that she was,, in. consequence of

them, treated with the utmost contempt: by that contempt, added to her plain style of life, she was sufficiently punished for her ridiculous desire to imitate 
% 
those people who of all others were the most improper for her imitation. 
t 
Charles, having taken orders, met with a woman of character and fortune who took a fancy to him, and would have married him y but he was under 5 necessity of disappointing both her and ’himself; as Sally, tho’ the most vicious of women, happened to outlive her rival. in his affections, 
lewson, - who never thoroughly recovered the loss of Fanny, spent his time. in consoiing Mr. Selby; and, dying soon after Mrs. Selby, left him and his font in possession of his whole fortune,
